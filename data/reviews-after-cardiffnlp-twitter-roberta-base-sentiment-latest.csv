I had read an account of it from the American point of view.,0.04512711,0.050233018,0.9046399
We decided against doing the touristy motorbike tour of the surrounding sights and we walked into the citadel through the gate that the Americans stormed into.,0.028925667,0.25297993,0.71809435

There was no information on this.,0.012903477,0.5773765,0.40972006

The guy at the entrance forbade us to go in.,0.03145673,0.18945049,0.77909285

"To the right, came the answer.",0.11937731,0.023909308,0.85671335

As the gate was open and no-one was around we walked in.,0.15602508,0.021595115,0.8223798
There was a man in a 'gallery' showing off artefacts.,0.06949187,0.048816267,0.8816918
He said we should just carry on.,0.07532144,0.08326064,0.84141797
So we did.,0.22632964,0.04870553,0.7249649

There were four people by the entrance to the impressive wooden building who were more interested in selling us books (but only those unsuited to what we wanted) rather than in looking at our non-existent ticket.,0.09294645,0.40385923,0.5031944
Once we had finished looking around we asked them where we could get a ticket.,0.082031816,0.0103971185,0.907571
They pointed down the road back the way we had come and we should go 'straight on'.,0.03950233,0.20284958,0.7576481
If we went straight on we would hit the large wall and I did not fancy trying to scale it to get in.,0.023203606,0.7066514,0.270145
This all felt very Vietnamese.,0.019702548,0.70745826,0.2728391
Officially we needed a ticket but unless there was someone on the gate then we were OK However there was no help for the independent tourist about where to get the said ticket.,0.026748512,0.45642325,0.51682824
Those who we asked did not have sufficient English to explain what we needed to do.,0.020963568,0.49350935,0.48552704
"Eventually we discovered from another rickshaw driver – our main source of information – that we could buy a ticket 'at the main entrance', wherever that was.",0.10316055,0.009856088,0.8869833
We could not go in through the gate where we had tried to go in as that was 'exit only'.,0.016708171,0.42327154,0.5600202
For one dollar we could have a ride to the entrance in the rickshaw.,0.16334252,0.019423688,0.81723386
We walked in the direction we thought most consistent with what we had been told by various rickshaw drivers.,0.09060628,0.023669077,0.88572466
Rounding the corner of the high 'forbidden city' walls we saw an enormous red flag fluttering on a large flag pole – just as it had for those three weeks during the Hue Tet battle.,0.041397713,0.2130475,0.74555475
"Then it had been a potent symbol of resistance against a supremely powerful aggressor, flashed around the world into every home with a TV.",0.22886315,0.073225304,0.69791156
"That must be where the entrance was, and so it proved.",0.11418663,0.034122236,0.8516911
Now the flag was showing the way we had to go.,0.08064753,0.077980526,0.84137195
Inside the Forbidden City we soon discovered that much of it had been completely destroyed by the battle.,0.011311365,0.69743776,0.29125085
"Some buildings had been reconstructed, but very many had not.",0.02196838,0.38760293,0.5904287
"However instead of leaving the ruins as a powerful reminder of the destructive power of war, it had all been flattened, or sanitised so it looked OK So it was now a partial rebuild based on old photographs, with big gaps where reconstruction had not taken place at all.",0.011943376,0.7489586,0.23909803
"The Soviets had rebuilt their ruined magnificent buildings with expertise and thoroughness when we saw places like Petrodvorets in 1983, less than forty years after the second world war, and what the Russians had done was beautiful and truly impressive.",0.927239,0.011249098,0.061511867
"What the Vietnamese had done, around fifty years after the destruction in Hue, was partial.",0.0076833987,0.71381533,0.27850118
"What was there was interesting, especially the sections that had mostly survived the destruction, but it was far from rebuilding the forbidden city as it once was.",0.20262581,0.24609092,0.55128324
"Nevertheless there were hidden treasures all over the large site, ones we had no idea were there when we came in as there were no guide books, or maps, to be bought anywhere, and indeed little signage that meant anything to us.",0.12109804,0.31972575,0.5591762
An appreciation of how the whole area once looked was shown in a film (Korean made) and by a model.,0.15855236,0.021728294,0.8197194
"However the model did not distinguish between what was once there, what had survived the destruction, what had been totally rebuild and what was still completely absent.",0.014811317,0.44918194,0.53600675
However we could not carry the model around to guide us.,0.02631058,0.52339256,0.45029685
Maybe we should have done the modern thing and photographed the model.,0.062343474,0.16590312,0.7717534
"However everywhere there were signs that said 'no picture' (sic) or the less definite 'no flash', by which they seemed to mean no pictures inside any of the buildings, although no-one seemed to bother much if you did take some with the flash on.",0.024327558,0.42915878,0.5465137
"The point of having no pictures taken seemed unclear as there was no gift shop to sell you pictures near the exit, as all other self-respecting tourist sites seem to have nowadays.",0.023449855,0.4374702,0.53908
"We did find hidden in discreet corners at the back of the site a couple of shops that seemed to be selling you quite interesting actual relics, as that is what the prices implied, although there was no guarantee that they were not copies.",0.3960962,0.016640158,0.58726364
They were undamaged by any bombs anyway.,0.053583134,0.41028345,0.5361334
We nearly became lost in the labyrinth at the back of the site with no maps anywhere to guide us.,0.009251142,0.8056599,0.1850889
However we spotted the large red flag hovering by the entrance and were able to navigate back so we could go out of the one and only exit route.,0.1818097,0.0437224,0.7744679
"Being what is meant to be a dry season, it poured with rain all day, the third day of heavy rain out of our four and a half days in Vietnam so far.",0.023043698,0.7133052,0.26365113
"This seems to be yet another climate anomaly and perhaps indicates where future battles need to be fought, but of a very different type to what happened in Hue.",0.014302537,0.44271168,0.5429858

For our cycle ride around the city he seemed pleasant and friendly enough.,0.8450221,0.006634979,0.14834288

When we arrived he then demanded $60 each.,0.03178908,0.34802082,0.62019014
We asked why and he said $60 including lunch.,0.046891056,0.091691904,0.8614171
Lunch was awful and by no means worth $10 in Vietnam.,0.00664958,0.9544839,0.038866512
Just an excuse to try hike the price up.,0.029945603,0.59484863,0.37520573

After a long coach trip of 3.5 hrs we stopped for lunch and then headed off to The Citadel in the baking afternoon heat - at this point I really didn't have my culture vulture head on my shoulders and didn't really feel like walking around in the heat and was trying to rustle up some enthusiasm for this tour and gave it a go.,0.14388484,0.2672977,0.5888175

So what went wrong.,0.01243947,0.6250968,0.36246374
Firstly we spent a half day visiting some tourist highlights around Hoi An and Danang and arrived at Hue at 3.00 PM in the afternoon on a National Holiday - there were people everywhere.,0.3693447,0.006175855,0.6244794
"Second we were due to leave Hue at 5,00AM next morning to drive back to Danang for a connecting flight to Hanoi - even the best tour organisers get their scheduling wrong at times.",0.014518734,0.67486376,0.31061748
Third - the Hue airport was closed for renovations (hence the dash back to Danang).,0.015156257,0.3141832,0.6706606
By the time we got settled into our hotel - Saigon Morin it was nearly 4.00 PM - so what to do.,0.06701202,0.059928328,0.8730596
"Fortunately, the hotel was close to most of the key tourist action in Hue so we decided to go to the citadel.",0.8618005,0.0050068195,0.13319275
We had planned to walk - quite a distance as it turned out - and it was hoty and humid.,0.039113414,0.55203223,0.40885434
We needed some cash so we looked for an ATM.,0.11066159,0.060254015,0.8290844
The one closest to the hotel was out of action - it was a holiday - the 4th day of a 5 day long weekend in Vietnam.,0.015817832,0.49567223,0.48850998
"April 30th is the National Day of Liberation, May 1 is Labour day - so with Saturday and Sunday leading up to the two major events the Monday was also taken as a holiday - so nothing official was open - no seciruty guards at banks and their ATMs.",0.07594995,0.067215264,0.85683477
The long weekend will be a recurring problem for anyone travelling anywgere in Vietnam in late April - early May eg in 2014 it will also be a 5 day long weekend covering Wednesday- Sunday so you will need to plan your itinerary carefully to stay in a nice resort place like Hoi An for this period.,0.054297138,0.16815616,0.77754664
Two very helpful cyclos directed us to another ATM about 200m down the road to Danang and that much further from our intended destination.,0.8389936,0.007669281,0.1533371
Having successfully obtained some cash from the ATM the cyclos pressed their services on us.,0.3475009,0.009896434,0.64260274
"Given the time of the day, the heat and humidity, the crowds and the prospect of a long walk we eventually relented.",0.2059408,0.050621618,0.7434376
We made a fundamental error at this point - we did not negotiate a fixed price for the service offered.,0.009216061,0.8490387,0.14174522
We found out later the going rate is arounf 30 - 40000 Dong for an hour on this mode of transport.,0.033258986,0.14221917,0.8245219
A ride on a cyclo is a breathtaking experience particularly at busy intersections in Vietnamtraffic - one feels incredibly vulnerable.,0.8400437,0.020398282,0.13955802

"The original negotiation was ""Whatever you like"" - well that does not work.",0.010933973,0.77893525,0.21013068
We were ripped off outrageously by these guys and basically we had no redress - they knew we were lacking in small denomination currency (they know the ATMs only deliver 500000 dong notes) and stood over us until we paid out.,0.0050664274,0.9301221,0.0648116
A most unpleasant experience that put a real dampener on the rest of the day.,0.0065330295,0.9312054,0.06226161
So here we were in the middle of nowhere.,0.036557946,0.38242418,0.58101785
When we got to the entrance of the Citadel the queues and the mass of people was so pressing we decided to simply walk back to the hotel.,0.06476755,0.16220938,0.77302307
We were too late to also take a dragon boat ride to the Pagoda and the royal tombs further down the river - highly recommended visits for Hue.,0.8709536,0.00735909,0.121687256
"We ate out for our evening meal visiting a restaurant recommended by the hotel staff, but in the end the Hue experience was a low point on our trip to Vietnam,

"The site has almost no information or facts about the buildings, the signs they do have are weather beaten and faded making them unreadable.",0.0064921654,0.8784269,0.115080975
