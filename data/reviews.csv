"We visited the Citadel with great expectations. It is very large, with a good collection of black n white photos of their kings and society hundreds of years ago.
We were most disappointed to see a flat empty open space where the Forbidden City once stood - bombed and destroyed completely during the war. Much of the rest of the imperial complex had also been similarly destroyed. Restoration work had recreated some spaces but much more needs to be done.
With a good guide, we were able to appreciate the highlights of its history."
"The Imperial City and the Purple Forbidden City are the alleged historical ensembles within the Hue Citadel.

We knew little about Hue and had almost no idea what to expect from the Citadel and Imperial City.

The Citadel, Imperial City, and Purple Forbidden City are well worth the morning. We were quite blown away by The Citadel and the enclosed Imperial City. Perhaps we should have spent more time here.

This might be the most historical site in Vietnam."
"The complex moat system surrounding the Citadel added an aura of mystery, leading us to the elaborate temples and palaces within. The grand processions that once graced these grounds echoed in our minds as we marveled at the intricate architecture and rich history that unfolded before our eyes. A must-visit for any couple seeking to immerse themselves in the grandeur of Vietnam's imperial past."
"Explore the exquisite historical site—an impressive and sizable complex. When you visit, consider dressing up—it’s a thoughtful gesture. Additionally, you’ll find informative details in English about the attractions. Allocate at least half a day to fully savor the experience."
"It's 2 hours from Da Nang 1-way, but thought it was worth it since we had a lot of time. If you just have a few days, I don't think Hue is a must."
"The grand scale of the citadel, with its intricate mosaics and elaborate gardens, provided a glimpse into the rich history and culture of Vietnam. The vibrant festivals held within the walls added a sense of life and excitement to the ancient architecture. We were in awe of the breathtaking structures and the attention to detail that went into every aspect of the citadel. Walking through the palace grounds, we felt transported back in time to a period of imperial grandeur. Hue Imperial City is a must-visit destination for anyone seeking a cultural and historical experience like no other."
"The main temple is closed for renovation, very big place for tourists to walk around but need more places to rest and re-charge and CLEAN toilets properly is the basic hygiene."
beautiful and ancient. We really like the space and scenery here. My tour guide told stories about what happened somewhere. It was great
Had a lovely trip here. The buildings are amazing and we were lucky to have some great weather. Great history too. We took a cyclo from here which was great but was organised for us by our tour guide - it was excellent too!
"We embarked on a 3-hour journey from Da Nang to Hue City, the former imperial capital, seeking authentic Vietnamese charm. Hue City, with its majestic imperial citadel, serene landscape, and rich cultural heritage, offers a uniquely enriching experience for travelers. During our short visit, we had the pleasure of indulging in Hue's specialties, which were truly amazing. Although our stay was brief, I hope to revisit Hue City in the future to further explore its wonders.

"Amazing architecture. Learn a lot about the history from our guide, Mr. Tan. He knows everything about this spot, and told us some interesting stories about the royal families. Would love to see more historical relics in Hue."
The grounds for the citadel are huge but the most important parts are walkable. There are several beautiful buildings here and we were told were palaces had been before they were destroyed in the war. Very interesting.
"Born and bread in Hue, Ruby arrived full of energy and ideas to help us discover her hometown. Her English was perfect.
Apart from the Citadel, Pagoda and tombs that are a must see she decided on day 2 to take us on an adventure.
Once per year in a small village near Hue occurs an important wrestling competition. We were immersed in local lore.
On our bikes she had us discover the villages, the artisans and the people. A quick stop to enjoy a decadent salt coffee.
Ruby did not miss an minute to educate us on local customs, history and she was simply good fun!
No dull moments with Ruby.

Should go with a guide. Can check prices at hotel. Citadel had to be reconstructed since structures were almost fully destroyed during US bombardments during the Vietnam war. Historical info is available in some places. Wear comfortable walking shoes. Takes about 2 hours to walkabout the area
"This was the highlight of our full day Hue tour from Da Nang.
The palace is set across the city center, over the Perfume river. Complex is really huge consisting of several palaces (main one closed for renovations), shrines, theater, Royalty residences, landscaped gardens,...etc, everything you might expect from an Imperial palace.
You need around 2 hours to cover the complex. As I said we were on a tour, with a good speaking (though sometimes tougher understanding) guide who explained a lot.
Without a guide it'd be pointless to wander around, so rent one if not on a tour.
The complex is not that old, dating to 19c. It was the political and administrative center of Nguyen dynasty. It reminds on similar Imperial seats of power in Korea, Japan, Thailand....certainly a must do visit."
"The main attraction of Hue, it’s a must to visit the citadel. Indeed we arranged a home stay within the walls which, although lovely, was probably not ideal. I’d recommend staying in a hotel across the river close to the shops and restaurants.
We went to the imperial city and hired a guide. She was particularly difficult to understand and we thought that an audio guide might have been a better alternative.
After less than an hour she left us to wander around which was better. We especially liked the gardens."
Be aware main palace is closed for renovation currently so while there is plenty to see and enjoy walking around the grounds the main event is off limits
"Many parts of the palace has been destroyed. Long walk not good for elderly, and if u want to know the history, it's better to get guided tour guide. Beware of the fruit seller (old lady around 60s). She is not honest. She took 200k dong from my mum's wallet when we just bought 2 packets of fruits without returning her the balance. This is clearly daylight robbery. Hope she will get her karma."
"Citadel Hué: Interesting but very poor educational service; hardly any information panels, audio guide useless:
A patchwork of information is read down by a seemingly bored german voice. Most places provide no information whatsoever."
"Step into the past with a visit to the majestic Hue Imperial City. With its distinctive traditions, grand processions, colourful lanterns, and intricate carvings, it's an experience you won't soon forget! Be sure to take lots of pictures - you'll want to show off your visit to this incredible place!"
"The complex worths the visit, even if the main building is under work.
Our mistake was to book a guide directly there, she explained us basically nothing and after 25 minutes she told us we had to continue on our own. Much better the audioguide that explains you each interesting point."
Amazing complex and we wish it wasn’t raining so hard in Hue whilst we visited. The whole palace will rival any European grand palaces. It will be amazing once they’ve finished restoration.
"We had a day in Hue and decided to visit. Keep in mind it was raining so take this review with a grain of salt but honestly it was not worth the 200,000 price of admission. The main palace is closed and there is no sinage to tell you what your looking at. Maybe if you pay more for a guide it would be better.

On top of that they ask you to pay another 200,000 once you are inside if you want to watch the show. Keep on mind the show is only 30 min long. Maybe it's nicer in better weather but honestly there is so much else to do in this city save your money and just explore."
"Went with a guide (recommended), the old city is really interesting if you are into history. Alot of influence from their neighbours, though some palaces are not standing, the remaining ones are pretty interesting. Overall a good walkable site and a must see palce I Hue."
"We toured this early on during a hot and humid day, which certainly helped. Interesting insight into the king’s life - I’m not sure I could have coped with so many concubines (700?) even without a eunuch to help me keep track. Interesting to see the bullet holes from the war. It’s a very big site, so we certainly looked forward to the aircon in the car afterwards."
"Its grand scale and intricate embroidery are truly impressive. From the elaborate ceremonies to the intricate gates, the City is a sight to behold. Visiting here will give you a unique insight into the grandeur of Vietnam's imperial past. It's an unforgettable experience that will stay with you for a lifetime."
We booked this trip through our Hotel in Da Nang. The site is beautiful. You can feel its antidote regality. The ruinous look of the.buildings adds to the allure. It’s good to see that there is renovations taking place as some parts need it. Definitely worth a visit.
Worth a good half day here. There is an extensive area to explore and a few areas one can sit down in. It can be very hot so umbrellas can be useful. There is a VR Simulator building which promises to recreate how the Citadel would have been. There is no signage to warn you that it operates on a very fast break neck speed motion camera flying you over the palace grounds. Fun for those who are ok with this sort of motion but my husband was really knocked up and it almost ruined our visit here. So be warned if this is not your thing!
"Not many buildings older than 1900, due to remodelling by last Dynasty of Vietnamese rulers.
Ist parts least interesting.
The exhibitions and explanations of the excavations of palaces on and around the site are very interesting. We'll curated, displayed and put in context, going back to about 900 AD.
Some stunning artefacts.
Nice gardens, decent cafe and opportunities to dress up."
"We were really underwhelmed by the visit. Both the palace and the main building were under construction. The citadel is very impressive from the outside, but very little from the inside. Colours have faded and the temples are not impressive. We had just visited Bai Dinh in Ninh Binh, which is marvelous and might have clouded our judgement."
"Allow plenty of time. Take fluids & sun protection, although there is plenty of shade. Very insightful, Fabulously beautiful, great photo opportunities. Lovely gardens. Enjoyed reading the historic information, especially the personal insight into the individuals. Only had 24hrs in Hue, appears a super clean, relaxed place & may give more time to explore if ever we pass this way again. Suggest you get a taxi from the city, as you'll be walking round most of the day."
"Beautiful setting, need to visit, even in case of little time, easy to stroll around, in between business meetings. Close to Saigon Hotel Morin where we were located, easy walk."
"The entrance fee is 200,000 VND, and the citadel was worth it! I never went to such a giant palace like this. When I went here, some parts were under restoration. However, in general, the whole structure still maintains its own beauty. The food stalls around are good, too! Although the weather when I visited the citadel was hot and sunny, I still loved the experience!"
We expected more and was a little disappointed as the site is a little run down. Once all the restoration is completed this will be an awesome site to visit. The garden is lovely and well kept.
"This is the last royal family, Nguyen’s imperial palace. The structure was influenced by forbidden city in Beijing. It brings you back to 19th century, the time of WW2.
A local driver I met during the trip told us that even though the entrance fee is extremely expensive, there’re many spots under restoration so it’s cheating. Well, maybe right since Noi Dien was under restoration when we were there in August but we couldn’t help it because we were tourists from abroad who can’t come here often.
It’s vast. You walk a lot in hot weather so bring waters with you."
"If it doesn't rain in Hue, it's fine. When it rains, you don't know when it stops. The entire Hue Citadel was soaked, Hue was sadder and more silent. The grass flowers (a delicate flower that is the ambassador of autumn) bloomed late and bowed in the rain. Even the bunches of purple magnolia blooming out of season cannot call back the sunshine."
"10 years ago when we were here, plane was late and we didn’t make it. So this time we stayed 2 nights in Hue to go inside. August was very hot so we tried to enter as soon as opened. So we got good 3 hours to walk around and take photos. Place was big. Gardens were nice. If you are into history, you can organise guide. We were happy we made this time."
Impressive area with much to see . Take a guided tour as there is information that provides context for the visit
We loved our visit here - the place is massive and reminded us of the Forbidden City in Beijing. Impressive and lovely strictures and fascinating history. Definitely a must see. Needs 2-3 hours.
"when i had Hue city trip two weeks ago,i came here to witness the history of Nguyen dynasty. it is a must-see attraction in Hue city. The imperial city is a walled enclosure within the citadel of the city of Hue,it is the former imperial capital of Nguyen dynasty. It contains palaces, shrines, gardens, and villas. it constructed in 1803 under Emperor Gia Long as a new capital. in 1993, it was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. unfortunately, when i visited this place, Điện Thái Hòa under renovation, it is the most important palace inside the imperial city,this palace houses the throne of all Nguyen Emperors. you need three hours to visit this place, especially if you are keen on history and also photos taking. heard that renovation of Dien Thai Hoa will be completed in 2025, so i will come again."
"It is a very impressive site. It is huge, beautifully kept and really interesting. It does get very busy at the main Pagodas, but because of its size, we managed to find peaceful places. We loved the Royal Gardens. We spent several hours there just enjoying the surroundings. It was worth travelling to Hue to visit this place. We only stayed in Hue for two nights, as we did not love the town itself."
"We visited during summer so the weather was extremely hot. Be prepared to walk a lot, bring lots of water, hat and sunblock.

We booked a one-day tour as we also wanted to visit the tombs and temples. The guide helps for us to understand some historical stories with Vietnam."
"You should spend a whole day in this attraction “ imperial hue “ due to it’s huge and spacious, if someone else is interested in historical researches he/she can not pass this citadel. You can order live guide at the ticket counter, ticket cost 10$"
Magnificent! It brings back a variety of things about Vietnamese history. Ordinary days will cost a small fee of about 200k (around $9) but it actually worth it for visitors. It has something really mysterious and a historical experience.
"Hue Forbidden City in Vietnam is a captivating destination that showcases the grandeur of the Nguyen Dynasty. The palaces within the complex are stunning, with intricate details and vibrant colors. The knowledgeable and friendly staff provide valuable insights, enhancing the experience. The well-preserved site, informative signage, and audio guides make it educational and visually impressive. A visit to Hue Forbidden City is a must for history and culture enthusiasts, offering a glimpse into Vietnam's royal legacy."
"Although it was hot, the long walk through the citadel was worth it. The citadel is a place of historical significance. From its elegant architecture to its lavish gardens, you will feel the sight that will take your breath. Its a must to experience it"
"I recently visited Hue Citadel during the summer, and while there were some positive aspects, my overall experience was a mix of pros and cons.

One of the primary challenges of visiting during the summer was the hot weather. The high temperatures made exploring the Citadel physically demanding and somewhat uncomfortable. It's important to come prepared with sunscreen, hats, and plenty of water to stay hydrated.

Another aspect that detracted from my experience was the perceived unfriendliness of the guards. While it's important to note that this might not be the case for everyone, I encountered some guards who were less than welcoming and appeared disinterested in providing assistance or answering questions. This lack of friendliness dampened the overall atmosphere of the Citadel.

On the positive side, the palace within the Citadel was impressive. The historical significance and architectural beauty of the buildings were evident, providing a glimpse into Vietnam's rich cultural heritage. The palace's intricate details and well-preserved elements were certainly worth exploring.

However, one downside was the excessive construction happening within the Citadel. The presence of ongoing construction work detracted from the overall ambiance and made it challenging to fully appreciate the historical surroundings. It would have been preferable if the construction activities were better managed to minimize their impact on visitors' experience."
"We had a really great time exploring the Imperial city. I would advise going early in the morning, we went at 10:00 and it was already baking hot although not particularly busy. It’s a large, beautiful site and you can easily spend a couple of hours strolling the various streets and pagodas. I also enjoyed watching the numerous Vietnamese ladies in traditional clothing who were having a great time posing for photos. Definitely a worthwhile place to see when in Hue."
beautiful.a great place both people and atmosphere.i love this place.love this scenic place.😍🥰😍😍
"This ‘gem’ was hyped us as the main reason to visit Hue and, as you approach it from the outside, the Citadel does look amazing with imposing ramparts and a moat. But we thought that the insides was a massive letdown. The vast proportion was either grassy patches or under renovation (including the Forbidden City), hidden under tarpaulin sheets. There was a small beautiful area around the Pavilion in the northwestern section but you had to work hard to find it and there was no signage. It was helped by being a stinking hot day but there was little in the way of shade either .
Luckily that day we went to 3 temples/tombs of the emperors just outside of Hue and that was a much more worthwhile trip - I suggest that you bin the Citadel and go there instead."
"Although it was hot, late in the afternoon, the long walk through the property was worth it. Make sure to look along rooflines."
"A must visit while in Hue! I would recommend getting an audio guide and listening to the areas that seem interesting to you to get a little more out of your visit. You can stay there for as long as you want. We walked though the entire compound, taking pictures, and listening to the audio guide occasionally, and we spent about 3-4 hours there. To me, the eastern side seemed more interesting, if you have limited time and just want to see part of it."
The Citadel is a place of historical significance to the Vietnamese people and should not be missed when visiting Hue. If you are visiting in July go early to avoid the heat.
"This magnificent citadel is a must-see for anyone visiting Hue. From its elegant architecture to its lavish gardens, the citadel is a mesmerizing sight that will take your breath away. Whether you're looking for a unique cultural experience or simply want to take in the beauty of the city, Hue Imperial City is a must-see."
"An amazing insight into the Imperial reign of Vietnam ! Fortunately we had a great local English speaking guide who informed us about the 13 Kings and their reigns. The 2nd King lived herewith his 500 concubines!
Unfortunately we chose the wrong season as it was a scorching 36 deg but felt like 42! .I would highly recommend hiring the tuk tuk to take you around the 500 hectares prop! Lots to see but walking in the extreme heat is no fun!
My fav places were the library and the Queen Mothers palace👍
Highly recommend to visit but get a guide."
"The Hue Imperial City is a Must-See! From its vibrant nightlife to its intricate mosaics and vibrant artistry, this majestic city is a sight to behold. Grand processions and festivals make it even more special. It's a must-see for anyone visiting Vietnam!"
"This ancient citadel, located in Hue, Vietnam, is home to numerous elaborate temples and majestic pagodas. From the intricate sculptures that adorn the walls to the grand entrance gates, you'll be in awe of the sheer magnitude of this grandiose structure. The vibrant colors and intricate details of the temples and pagodas will leave you in awe. Whether you're a history buff or simply looking for a unique experience, Hue Imperial City is a must-see. Don't miss out on the chance to marvel at this stunning sight."
"I found the Imperial City (The Citadel) to be charming, interesting and pleasant. It was, perhaps the most interesting and charming place I visited in my trip to Vietnam. It was like a very relaxing walk in a huge park, where now and then you came across temples, palaces and other buildings in different stages of restoration. Because it is so large, it is almost never too crowded and you almost never have to stay in line to see any of its beauties. If you have the time, you could easily spend half a day here, may be even longer, just wondering around, admiring the flowers, the vegetation and the colors and architecture of the various buildings. Yes, it is not a Borobudur, a Prambanan or a Angkor Wat, but it is a lovely and relaxing place..."
"The Imperial City of Huế is a walled enclosure within the citadel of the city of Huế, the former imperial capital of Vietnam during the Nguyễn dynasty. It contains the palaces that housed the imperial family, as well as shrines, gardens, and villas for mandarins1.

Constructed in 1803 under Emperor Gia Long as a new capital, it mostly served a ceremonial function during the French colonial period. After the end of the monarchy in 1945, it suffered heavy damage and neglect during the Indochina Wars through the 1980s. The Imperial City was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993 "
"With its elaborate marble carvings, intricate gates, and impressive architecture, it is no wonder that it is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the area. The walls of the Citadel are made of brick and stone, and are surrounded by a moat. Inside, visitors will find a complex of palaces, courtyards, and gardens. The architecture of the Citadel is a stunning blend of Chinese, Vietnamese, and French influences, and is sure to impress even the most seasoned traveler. The marble carvings and intricate gates are a testament to the skill of the artisans who created them. Whether you are looking for a unique cultural experience or simply want to marvel at the impressive architecture, Hue Imperial City (The Citadel) is the perfect place to visit."
"From the majestic Citadel, to the grand palaces, to the colourful lanterns, the city is a feast for the eyes. The Citadel is a stunning example of traditional Vietnamese architecture, and its grand palaces are a testament to the country's vibrant artistry. The colourful lanterns that adorn the city's streets add a unique touch of colour and beauty to the city. The city is also home to many vibrant markets, where visitors can find a variety of local goods and souvenirs. The city is a perfect destination for those looking to experience the culture and beauty of Vietnam."
This turned out to be much larger than I had thought. You could spend a half day to a full day exploring it all. They have golf cart cars you can rent to take you all over. It’s a nice walk though with lots of areas to pop into for shade. I would suggest the audio tour.
"From the elaborate temples to the intricate embroidery, from the impressive fortifications to the elaborate gardens, this is a place that will leave you in awe. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is one of the most important cultural sites in Vietnam. The Citadel is a great place to explore and learn about the history of the city. It is also a great place to take in the stunning views of the city and the surrounding countryside. A place to experience the culture and history of Hue."
"The majestic landscape, with its lush green foliage and the majestic Perfume River, is the perfect backdrop for a truly unforgettable experience. Whether you're looking for a peaceful stroll or a thrilling adventure, Hue Imperial City has something for everyone. And don't forget to take in the breathtaking views from the top of the Citadel! A visit to Hue Imperial City is an experience you won't soon forget."
"The Imperical city was just in the center. It's near the Perfume river and Dongba market. We visited tombs, local villages, market and Thienmu pagoda. It's all fine for a city tour"
"We got here early as it gets really hot here during the day, and even at 9am we were sweltering. This site is incredible, and at every turn there is an amazing historical building to look at, the most beautiful gardens and pretty bridges and waterways. It was sad to see that some of the buildings were in dire need of repair, and renovations are very necessary, but you can see that work is in progress with some areas - the site is huge and you will need at least 2-3 hours to walk around this beautiful place. An unmissable attraction when in Hue and well worth coming to see."
"Unmissable part of Vietnamese history. They’ve done a lot of restoration since other half’s visit 20 years ago. He assured me that there were only bomb craters and it would only take 5 minutes, but fortunately he was completely wrong! Lots to see, from the bullet holes to the Empress Dowager’s quarters. It was atmospheric with all the Vietnamese decked out in traditional costume for the special 5-day Bank Holiday."
"Located in the center of Hue City, a heritage, imperial style.
Nearly the Huong River, restaurants, coffee shops, The Nguyen Imperial Citadel.
Just own small swimming pool so regrettable
Nice staffs, faster check in…"
"The history and culture that is all part of the experience was amazing, the private gardens in the forbidden City were spectacular"
"The complex is really big and you need a few hours to see everything, really impressive all the buildings"
A guided tour is the way to go. There is a lot of history associated with this complex that a knowledgeable docent can provide. We were able to explore most of the buildings. Only a few were closed for renovation. Definitely more preservation are needed. There were vast sunflower gardens in bloom. Does the symbolic flower of the sun represent royalty?
"From the moment you step through the gates, you'll be overwhelmed by the lavishness of the Citadel. The intricate architecture and colorful decorations make it a sight to behold and will leave you feeling like royalty. The Imperial City also offers a variety of activities to keep you entertained, from exploring the many palaces to shopping in the bustling markets. With so much to do and see, you won't soon forget your visit to this regal city."
"Hearth of Hue city. Large palace area where the rulers lived for centuries. Site consist of several palaces, temples and building for servants. Now it serves as museum with many interesting information.
All descriptions are in English."
Very interesting historical site.. We have visited three times over the years to check the progress of the restoration. Great to see big changes every time.
"Before I visited the Citadel I watched all the youtube videos about the American fighting in Hue and the Citadel and learnt that much of the buildings were destroyed. While it is an amazing experience to walk in the Citadel, the experience was somewhat superficial as there is little understanding of what life was like when it was operating as a palace during its imperial days. My visit was just over 4 hours. I took a guided tour which told me most of the things that I have already read from the internet. I rewalked from the entrance again. Most of the major buildings were being constructed and it is expected to take a few years so the experience is likely to be muted for a while."
"This UNESCO World Heritage site is a must see when one visits Huế for the first time, and for me, more than once. Though many buildings were destroyed, there are still quite many things to see. Highly recommended."
The palace of Supreme Harmony is a serene and beautiful place with many temples. The grounds are well kept and we had a tour guide to give us the history which I would recommend. A thoroughly enjoyable tour.
"It is such a huge complex with temples, palaces, and ruined areas. You should spend at least 2 hours here. They are doing some restoration and rebuilding but it is still worth visiting."
"We were planning on getting the audio tour to provide an explanation of all the buildings and grounds but decided to pay 150K for the Imperial City Guide that they offer as it was very cheap. The guide ended up only being for 15 minutes and was a little bit difficult to understand. She did a quick run through of the history of the place and mentioned that only 30% of the Imperial City was left after having been bombed in the wars. It would have been amazing to have seen it in its glory days. In hindsight a private guide to take you through the complex would have been well worth the cost.

It’s a very big complex and we spent around 3.5 hours going through the Imperial City. There are so many beautiful places to see. I particularly liked seeing the Vietnamese dressed in the traditional garments taking professional photographs around the site.
The main temple you see when you first walk in is covered in scaffolding so no doubt will be spectacular once the restoration is finished. What has been restored was nice to look at and no doubt as they continue to restore more buildings it will get even better.

It was very hot on the day we were there so take plenty of water with you as there is a lot of walking. We really enjoyed our morning at the Imperial City and this was one of the highlights of our trip to Vietnam."
I guess all visitors first drive to the Royal Tombs and then come to the Citadel. It has been recently restored. Unfortunately not all the buildings survived and put back to the places where they were. Nevertheless there is plenty to see and learn! Don’t miss VR tour as it helps to picture together how this place once been
A big letdown as the major building is closed up for renovation and replaced with a big signboard. Paid for the ticket and see only the smaller building.
"It's a huge complex, full of history and culture. They are working on refurbishing and recovering the damage to this historic site during more recent wars so some of the areas were not available, but there was still plenty to see. We chose not to take an audio tour but wish we had done so as many of the exhibits and areas were not covered in English."
"Not as polished or spectacular as some palaces etc. but that makes it feel like an authentic delve into Vietnamese history. .
Relatively inexpensive.
Charming and beautiful gardens.
Good insight into the culture and history of Vietnam."
"This is a wonderful visit, but the place is huge. We had to rent a golf cart for an hour as we had a person in the group with mobility issues. There is a souvenir shop where you can see incense sticks being made, which was interesting too."
"We strolled around the Citadel but not the entire property. It IS impressive but our group thought it could be better upkept for an important site, unless it is intended to have weeds on the painted pavilions and overgrown grass around it."
"A trip here with a knowledgeable tour guide provides an excellent overview of Vietnamese history. It would be possible to spend two full days here, so if time is limited, a guide is highly recommended to provide the best overview in a few hours. Expect a lot of walking."
Amzing Trip in Viet Nam....A lot of experiences about Viet Nam history and Viet Nam war...Tourguide explain well done Mr Eric Đặng
"The proble for me here, is that we visited the citadel on the most awful wet and windy day. There is not a lot of cover, so you have little choice but to brave whatever the day throws at you.
the citadel is impressive, but i just wish i hadn't been shaking with cold and dripping everywhere!"
"The old walled city of Hue and Imperial Palace, well worth a look. It is a very large area where restoration work is being carried out in some areas. What has already been restored is well worth looking at, but there is a lot left to be done. If you like sites like this, you could spend hours here."
"The imperial palace in hue is the must visit site while in hue, minimum 3 to 4 hours are needed to explore this site, with plenty of gardens, courtyards. It was raining during my visit making the weather cool and pleasant to move around the site other wise on a sunny day, it would have been hot and humid. It is more beautiful to view this palace during the night when it's lights are on."
"The imperial city of Hue covers a big area that you will discover on foot. For me, the nicest part is the one in the middle, especially the reading house of the emperor, which was a wonderful building.
Inform yourself in advance if you are interested in a traditional theatre piece: there are representations twice a day in the theatre!
Not that we stopped at a cafe near a pond and had an ice cream that made us sick. I would absolutely avoid doing this again!"
I was there for a short visit and the citadel was impressive with the history. But I felt like I could have done it better with a tour guide to explain the history.
Didn't expect much but was rather impressed by the information of history and pictures of past royalty. Was nice to stroll through the well manicured peaceful gardens. Go to the gift shop. The young ladies working there are very informative and happy to explain crafts. The tea they serve is a nice restful pitstop.
"This vast walled compound is best to visit with a local guide who can give more insights to the history and different uses of the buildings, temples, etc. located inside it. Expect to spend at least a half day of walking if you want to see/visit everything in the area."
"We added a couple of nights in Hue to round out a month of traveling - by boat and bike through Vietnam and Cambodia.
We had no idea of what to expect in Hue. We were blown away by The Citadel.
It is reminiscent of The Forbidden City in Beijing. The Garden area was especially impressive.
The weather limited us to one full day of exploring, but we are so glad we included Hue in our itinerary.
We exited The Citadel and a short walk brought us to Les Jardines de la Carambole for lunch. We stayed at the Azerai, La Residence hotel just across the river with a great view of The Citadel."
This is a wonderful place to visit with lots of different areas to see. Unfortunately the main palace is being renovated but there’s lots of other historical areas and information to look at. You need about a morning to see the whole grounds.
"The place is the highlight of our Vietnam trip. I wish we could have spend more
than the 1 day that we had in our schedule.
There are so many things to see and explore. It must be even more interesting in
future when more conservation projects will come to finish.
What is most amazing about the place is that the Royal family was still there up
to the middle of the last century - so many things are really a""live"" monuments.
Sadly many parts are ruin from wars.

Not to be missed - give the city 2~3 days at least."
This is the highlight of any visit to Hue. The complex is vast and will easily take at least two hours to enjoy (or more).
"Loved Hue. It’s one of our favorite cities in Vietnam Nam. Had a wonderful trip, arranged by Urbanist Travel, which planned all the details of our terrific visit. The English-speaking guide was extremely knowledgeable about the history of Vietnam, all the sites in Hue and local culture. She was a delight to spend the day with and even provided helpful home remedies for a cold that I had caught."
Very interesting experience to learn about the imperial history of Vietnam / Hue - this is the main tourist attraction in Hue - definitely worth a visit
Even the weather was not really nice when we were here but it's still worth to spend like one and a half hour or even longer if you have time. You'll have a chance to know about the Vietnam History as well as admire the attractions.
Deep dive into history of kings of Vietnam. The entrance ticket is 200.000 VND but worth it. Takes an hour or two to walk around the huge complex to see the attractions. Map provided at the ticket counter is helpful. They also have cable operated cars to take people around for extra charge. Visited in the morning hours around 830 am and the weather was pleasant.
This was a disappointnent because the 2 main attractions were boarded up for restoration - Thai Hoa Palace and Forbidden Purple City. The rest are peripheral buildings. There should have been information at the ticket counter about these major omissions so that visitors can make an informed decision whether to pay the admission price.
"Impressive to see and a worthwhile day trip, we had really bad weather during our visit which limited our enjoyment.

Poncho's on, we still maximised our visit and actually benefited from the poot weather as it was very quiet."
"Well worth a visit but pay for a local guide to show you around as their is so much history to talk about.

Sadly many parts were destroyed in the war so not all the buildings can be seen."
"I had a wonderful stay here. The atmosphere is very good, the scenery is poetic and the guide is very friendly. On the first day, we were surprised when our guide named Minh gave us a local product. I don't remember its Vietnamese name. However, it is delicious to eat and it is made from rice.
To this day, I still miss its taste very much. Thank you Minh.
After 5 days in Hue, I have learned more about the history of this land, the beautiful sights and people in Hoi An. I am very impressed with the scenery here. Very fresh air."
Disappointing that two of the main buildings are under renovation but still lots to see. Took us 5 hours to walk it all in 31C heat. Queen mothers areas are really lovely as are the gardens and reading room areas. We found lots of places with very few people and stop for a cold drink and ice cream in queen mothers pleasure house on a pond. Delightful.
"The Citadel is till very well preserved. We had a private tour with Tonny, our very professional guide who told us much about VN history and cultures. We also visited the Dong Ba market and a hat making village. It's just in the city center and can be visited on foot or by a cyclo. Do not miss!"
"Entry is 200,000 (without an audio guide, which is an extra 100,000) and this gets you access to all parts of the imperial city. We didn’t feel like you needed an audio guide as there are many signs in various languages. Some of the buildings are really cool and make for some good photos. NB be aware that we tried to go off the path at one point, and there was a snake in the grass, so my advice would be stick to the paths!"
"We had a private driver that drop us at the exit. It was a long way to walk to the entrance (ticket office) in the drizzle. With only an hour to complete this venue, we are walking through the ruins (some area are w partial walls left) n had no ideas on these places.
Was lost while trying to find the exit to the waiting vehicle as they are insufficient signage.
Better to have a guide while inside the ruins n 2hrs should be good to cover the area."
"A visit to Hue would not be complete without a visit to the Citadel. Located only a short walk from the city centre, the Citadel is an attraction worthy of a few hours.

Entry can be obtained through a few different gates, although the main gates are recommended if you need to buy a ticket. The Audio Tour is also only able to be purchased from the main gate.

While much of the Citadel has been damaged or destroyed by previous conflicts, ongoing restoration is beginning to return it to its former glory. That which is complete is just stunning. There is a lot of information and historical photos displayed around the Citadel to provide visitors with useful facts.

I strongly recommend putting aside about 2-3 hours to take a leisurely walk around the Citadel."
"Hung our guide was brilliant. Knowledgeable , friendly and helpful.
Hung brought the history to life and left us with wonderful memories.
Great value and so much more than an audio guide."
"The citadel is definitely worth taking a look at but to get the most out of the experience get the audio guide. We got an actual guide and they were very disappointing, providing very little information and trying to sell us a boat trip repeatedly. Also don’t bother with the virtual reality experience it only last a few mins and was not worth the extra money. Also note that a number of the key buildings including the main throne rooms are currently closed for restoration which was a bit disappointing..The best thing about the citadel is the peaceful gardens away from the traffic. If you want to stay for a while take your own food and drink as the shops inside are very limited."
"soooooooo there was no toilet paper, however they have many delightful fish and one pond especially where you can buy fish food to feed the fish - also gr8 for a hot girl walk xoxo"
"One of the recognized UNESCO site in Hue, Vietnam. This palace was built in the year 1803. Once again, having a reputable tour guide will make the visit worthwhile. This site is enclosed by a huge wall. The palace was the place were the imperial family lived. There were 13 kings to be exact, each with its own interesting history and how they came about to be kings. There are shrines, gardens and villas. One building is still under construction. It took me half a day to walk around, and this is not enough time to see everything. At the end, I enjoyed visiting this place. Travelers should put this on their list to visit when in Vietnam."
"Here’s what’s important:
1. If raining bring an umbrella, it will be constant and sad
2. Scan the QR code at the ticket booth and download the app - it will give you readable information on most areas, no need to pay for the audio guide
3. There are shows at the theatre building within the citadel (at 10-10:40am and 3-3:40pm), 200,000VND for a ticket. We didn’t know this was real until we were nearby and heard it start at 3, we didn’t bother running in as entry was already 200,000VND - you can hear it from outside and we managed to stumble on orchestra rehearsals in the building near it anyway

2 main buildings are still under renovation, one has been taken down completely but pictures are up and the app describes it so you still get an idea

Is it worth the entry? Yes

Spent about 4 hours there"
"This is a step back in time when visiting the imperial city. It is across the river from most of the main hotels and I would recommend an audio tour if you don’t have your own tour guide. It is big place with some magnificent buildings and architecture, you get an idea of how the Emperor lived with his 104 wife’s. The gardens are tranquil and you can see the influence the Chinese had on this nation hundreds of years ago.
I also travelled to the monastery where you get the story of how a monk immolated himself in Saigon in 1963 to protest their treatment by the government of the time. We visited a fishing village just out of town that demonstrates how rice is harvested and used.
The Dong Ba Markets which are just over the Truong Tien bridge are well worth a couple of hours. This is an assault on your senses, it crowded and chaotic but it’s Asia, bargaining is the way to do business and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
I recommend that two nights is sufficient, you can visit all the sights, shop at the markets and still have time to chill."
"If you're into Hue's history and art, then definitely go and see this. If you're like me, who happened to be passing by the area, then also worth a visit. However, if you're planning this and read up on this place beforehand, then you could be in for a disappointment as it doesn't look anything as spectacular as the forbidden city in Beijing. I was told by my partner about it as we were passing by and I wouldn't have guessed by the derelict exterior that it used to house an emperor within! To be fair, when we went in, I was surprised to find that an effort was made to maintain the place in a relatively decent condition. It was raining on the day of my visit, and also the main building was under renovation for another few years so we just walked around and made the most of the visit."
I think it cost 200k dong to enter Hue Citadel and it was well worth it as we spent about 6 hours there exploring different temples and palaces. Most of the structures are about 200 years old and must have been magnificent back in 1900 AD. I wish that there were a few more sign posts as it was occasionally difficult to figure out where we were.
"Nice place with delicious food.
Good value for money option: dishes with enough size and suitable price.
Really happy with the service provided by Sim, who can assist you in english and this is really pleasant when you are a tourist."
"Beautiful historic site.
UNESCO heritage and well worth visiting.
Take at least half a day to visit this unique site.
It is a vast complex with a lot of interesting buildings.
So take your walking shoes and you make your 10:000 steps easily!!"
Good atmosphere. Great food. Peaceful. Easy to find local food in town. Local people very friendly. Easy to access landscape.
"It’s about two hours or so drive from Da Nang. A historical tour, with the guide’s explanation, you leant a lot about the Nguyen dynasty and emperors."
This is the site that everyone comes and visits when in Hue. Despite every tourist coming to visit the site is so large there is ample opportunity to be alone and sit and relax and absorb the atmosphere. There are ongoing restorations so some sections are closed but this is a very impressive construction. Certain building regulations stemming from the Citadel still apply to Hue. Come and find out what they are...
"Brillant tour guide

Today we did a 3 hour private walking tour of Hue Imperial city with our amazing guide Ngo Thi Kim Hong. She is a 5 star plus guide.

The visit was amazing and very interesting thanks to Hong’s knowledge and conversation style.

We moved through the imperial city at a relaxed pace but yet saw so many beautiful features and got loads of photos.

Thank you so much."
Learning bits and pieces about Hue’s (And Vietnam’s imperial history). Visit here and take photos! Having an English-speaking guide would probably help us to appreciate the place better
We were amazed at the huge ancient building of the imperial city where the emperor had resided. This is one of the UNESCO heritage site which one must not miss!
"Hue is a wonderful place to spend a few days. It can be done in a day trip from
DaNang or Hoi An but you’d be worn out. Like a smaller Forbidden
City but with some softening of grass and trees"
"Hue is a gorgeous little city in Vietnam and the Hue Imperial City is a must see. It's a well preserved UNESCO heritage sight and its the most visited attraction in the area.

Tickets are 200k VND and well worth it. You can explore the grounds and admire the amazing architecture around. The walls are great to walk from inside and out, and a lot of the structure remains the same as it has for centuries. It's quite pretty in places too with lots of colourful flowers and green grass.

You're free to roam around or can take an additional guided tour if you wish. It's easy to get to from anywhere within the city really. Highly recommended"
A nice open space to wander around and see the sights. There is an audio tour if you want it. We enjoyed our time.
"Charmin, nice and enjoyable! I been there during the cold days of winter, very rainy and humid, but even so, this was a good moment to be there."
"Well worth the visit, however bear in mind this is a work in progress. There is a clear difference between areas which have been restored, those in progress (plenty of scaffolding and restricted access to some main features) and those which are complete.
We did the audio guide so we could go at our own pace however it is rather factual (construction material, number of floors, dates etc) and lacking in story telling - would recommend a guide to help bring more of this fascinating world to life.
We also went early, avoiding the heat of the day and crowds."
That is very beautiful temple.We stayed in Hue 3 nights and came there 2 times.It made us feel peaceful and quite
We had 3 nights in Hue and that is second time we came to Hue imperial city.It was very nice and peaceful
"Went to venue expecting to see the Palace within the citadel, after purchasing tickets was informed Palace was closed for restoration.
The information it says it goes back to the early 1800, but when you look closer the walls are concrete or rendered. Then it says about most of the buildings being rebuilt from 1950.
That's fine, things need to be restored to keep them, but do it in a traditional way!
Will not return and would not recommend."
"The Citadel is really a must see. Cost is $200k each for as long as you'd like to wander around! We opted for an audio guide at a further $100k each - would really recommend that you hire an audio guide - available in 8 languages, or an actual guide! Before you enter the Citadel proper, go left for audio guides or right for a real guide. We were here 8 years ago and didn't bother with a guide at that time, and regretted it! The compound is huge, with lots of great photo opportunities. Some parts are under renovation which is to be expected with buildings so old. There are also many photos and mementos of the emperors. Don't forget your hat and drink bottle if it's a hot day!"
"Great visit. Please note some of the buildings are being refurbished, so maybe just a 30 or 40% of the imperial city can be visited."
Nice place however most of the buildings where closed due to renovation period which we did not know about- but still had to pay full price for tickets.
A really stunning place a hidden gem of Vietnam it's beautiful! Would go again I definitely recommend to any travelers or locals!
We went on the imperial city and tombs tour and it was really good. Phi was our guide and she was super nice and explained us a lot about Hue and Vietnam history in general. We learned a lot. Recommended!
"We had a full day to visit Hue. It's one of the spot that you should not miss, just in the center. We spent just 1 night here, 2 nights would be better."
A wonderful place with the history of Vietnam. This is just one of the places you really must go when you are in Hue City. Vietnam's old imperial palace.
"The tour by car rental in Hue is the best. My group and Mr. Hai's car team visited the old citadel, visited nature and especially, eating here was quite cheap. Hue Citadel is a place that leaves many impressions with us. See you again in Hue, meet driver Hai again."
The main gate and outside wall reminds you of the forbidden city in Beijing only smaller. However the place is huge and composed of several buildings. The main palace is under renovation but the surrounding structures are properly restored. The temple for the former Emperors was great and the history is completely exhibited. A must place to see in this former capital.
Some really well restored buildings and some not so much. Nice for an afternoon but wouldn’t bother with the combo ticket as it was overpriced and all very similar architecture and culture.
"Decent but overpriced and difficult without a map. They couldn’t be bothered to staff the audio tour kiosk so we couldn’t get the audio tour which comes with a map. It was super hot and we got lost many times, it is a huge site. There’s lots to see, it looks pretty good but no idea what it was all about without any context and not much to read."
"A lot to see here, recommended for a day trip just to this palace. It was raining while we were there. Ticket cost 200K just for the place , there are options to buy combo tickets for including other attractions as well. Maps provide at the ticket counter was really helpful."
"Big place to walk around, take the shuttle to get around if you have senior travelers. Best appreciated with a decent guide. Take note there’s a dress code for entering the prayer hall, basically keep your shoulders and knees covered.

This is the largest attraction in Hue, so pretty much do it otherwise there’s not much point visiting Hue."
"This is a great stop to learn more about the history of Hue. There are many things to see. Everything from beautiful buildings, to prayer areas. I’d suggest taking an umbrella or hat, as there are some shaded areas but walking around can get hot."
"Hue is the ugliest city I’ve been to, it is dirty and the people here are so rude and pushy and annoying they will force you to sell their goods. Probably the worst city in Vietnam people here are disrespectful. The Citadel is not much to see, spend your money somewhere else in Vietnam."
"Its a good adventure to spend a more hours. We opted for one entrance which took us around 2 hours. It was 200K and you buy your ticket at the gate. When you enter there are maps where you can see which each building is. Good activity to do, you can see some areas are under construction as well."
"Why would you come to Hue and NOT visit the Citadel ?! It is the main attraction. It is a big site and one should allow at least half a day to explore it. Not much remains of the royal palace (the French burned most of it), but there are plenty of other beautiful buildings left. I particularly liked the magnificently decorated gates all over the site. Very picturesque and photo genetic."
"Back to Vietnam after a long rest of Covid, Hue is such a beautiful city. Citadel is breathtaking, not gigantic but sophisticated enough. Worth your trip to be there."
Nice and quite large place to visit. More than half of buildings have been destroyed. But you can still imagine a glorious era in the history of Viet Nam through this trip. Some beautiful place to take photos >)
"It's great that the ancient citadel of Hue had survived to an extent where its opposite number in Hanoi is now just some remnants. Even though war has hit it hard and lots of buildings have been destroyed you can still see the layout and structure well.

Sometimes it is difficult to be sure what is ""original"" and what had been reconstructed - there are clearly a number of sites where wholesale reconstruction is going on. There is a worthwhile debate to be had as to whether it is better to preserve ""as is"".

It's is definitely a day visit - there is so much to see that it is worth taking your time. The audio guide is informative - so worth spending the extra 100K on top of the 200K entry fee."
We went to Vietnam and a tourist attraction that we visited is the Hue Imperial City. An ancestral place where you will experience somewhat a walk into the past. Picture perfect and historical place indeed.
A must visit attraction in Hue city. I spent almost 3 hours to explore all the monuments in the complex of Hue Imperial Citadel. It is such a beautiful place but the entrance ticket is quite expensive ( 200K for person).
"An awesome experience indeed , place well preserved despite the hundreds of years legacy in it
Place where visitors can see how the Royals have lived in splendor dating 500 years and beyond"
Lovely historic buildings and calm relaxed atmosphere. There are lots of parts to explore so take your time. Find out about the rulers of this old time palace & get some great pics.
"Anyone with even the the most sparse knowledge of the Vietnam war will have this on their ""must see"" sights, however the site itself is very extensive. It is gradually being restored (a slow job) and it is easy to spend a couple of hours exploring, even in pouring rain which is how it was when my wife and I were there, not much cover"
"A great location to spend time in and wander back into the past.
Grounds are very big and the further you get back the more the discoveries.
Would recommend - choose a cool day to visit !"
"The Citadel is a must-see on a first visit to Hue. Although just a small number of buildings have been restored, work appears to be underway on several more. I wish there was a way they could do more to re-create the interiors (assuming the original furnishings are no longer available) to give visitors a sense of what life was like."
"UNESCO included the Hue Imperial Citadel on it's list of world heritage sites in 1993 and it is very deserving of that. Even as it's being carefully restored in the wake of extensive damage during the Vietnam War, it's incredibly impressive for its history and beauty. And on a more personal note, it was so nice to see so many young Vietnamese taking so much interest in their history. The place is absolutely sprawling so leave yourself enough time to get what you want - a drive-by or a quick-peek at the citadel just really isn't a thing. And, go by at night too. The city lights up the flag tower and the one of the palaces over the main gate in a way that is just stunning.

This is really a must - see."
"My wife and I had booked at 17-day trip through Vietnam and Cambodia with G-Adventures and the town of Hue was our third location visited. Although our G-Adventures guide was excellent, local guides were provided at every stop on our tour, including Hue. I’d recommend having a guide if you want to get the best from your Imperial Citadel experience as, otherwise, you would be left wandering around blindly trying to find all the relevant history for yourself.

The tour was excellent and very interesting, and the most impressive place to visit near Hue, though I don’t think it merits the five-star reviews that some have given it. Each to his/her own I suppose, and that’s the beauty of travelling, in that we all see things from different perspectives. As I said though, definitely look to go with a guide or, at the very least, rent one of the portable audio guides."
"You are in Huê! The city chosen by Emperor Gia Long, in 1789, to be the very first Imperial capital of the newly unified Vietnam. On the Northern banks of ""Sông Huong"" - the ""Perfume River"" - he started, in 1802, the construction of his walled citadel, with a ringing moat and two meter thick ramparts. Visit the citadel, its gates, palaces, outer and inner courts, pavilions, residences, temples, ponds and gardens. And do not miss its innermost enclosure - the ""Forbidden Purple City"" - an area once restricted to the Imperial Family and closest attendants only. At its ""Duyet Thi Duong"", the beautifully restored ""Royal Theater"", performances of traditional music and dances. Check performances' schedules, as they are very interesting and a unique chance to attend a show by the ""Hue Royal Palace Arts Troupe"". The ""Royal Citadel"" was pretty much damaged during the Vietnam War and from its 160 buildings, only a dozen survived. It is a shaddow of what it once was, but still beautiful and deserving a visit by all those traveling in and around Huê, a Unesco appointed, in 1993, ""World Heritage Site""! Enjoy!"
"AMAZING!! If there is only one thing you'll do while visiting Hue let this be it! So much beauty and history. The grounds are massive and the gardens so lush. You could spend all day here and not get bored. I was extremely impressed with how well the preserved the place. The one thing that put me down was the amount of rubbish. It's very disrespectful. But apart from that it was absolutely fantastic, a great day in Hue."
"We'd been years earlier but perhaps it was the lack of crowds, but this was a great visit and totally worth the time"
"The whole experience was great. Super impressive with the buildings and history. However, the amount of rubbish we saw around the palace was very disappointing. Some places looked liked they haven't been cleaned for months. The management team should take care of this attraction better..."
"I travelled all the way from Hoi An to see the imperial city and it was quite underwhelming. I really thought it was going to be a lot better than what it was.

Don’t get wrong, it’s really nice to walk around, very peaceful, quiet and some really nice architecture to look at. But aside from that, it’s very average.

Luckily it doesn’t cost much to go in. It’s worth a visit for a nice walk, but I wouldn’t travel just to see it."
"We visited the Citadel with a 3 year old and 7 year old. We took advice from previous recommendations and took the audio guide and like others were pleased we did as we would not have known what we were looking at, as the map given did not appear to direct us correctly.
It was incredibly hot and our youngest struggled to remain interested. Both however enjoyed the extensive ground and freedom to roam around the grounds.
Unfortunately due to low visitor numbers the Art activities which would have captivated the children were not available.
Would recommend to the onsite gift shop located near the exit as it had great range of traditional Vietnamese souvenirs at reasonable prices."
"the building is amazing, but somehow it is just not impressive and not that really old and charming but still this is a must visit place in Hue"
"Even after a full morning of touring, a visit to the Hue Imperial City (The Citadel) was on our agenda. We likened it to a mini-Forbidden City but still impressive. Certain aspects of the Hue Imperial City were actually more interesting...perhaps because it felt more ""lived in"" and was on a smaller scale. It particular, we thoroughly enjoyed the Royal Theater, and the grounds were very well maintained. Glad we made the extra effort to visit."
"We were so lucky that we had a tour guide with us, for our visit to Hue Imperial City Citade. If you have not got a guide you will not have a cue what it is or what it was for.
The Nguyen Dynasty ruled between 1802 and 1945. it is a very good place to have a couple of hours, taking in all the infomation our guide was giving us."
"First time in Hue and one thing couldn’t be missed is visiting Hue Imperial City.
I love every corner of this historic place"
If you like history this site will make you happy. The citadel is quite impressive. It is fascinating to see this heritage of Vietnam's old capital and the legacy of kings and emperors.
"Normally I love stuff like this. This was very boring. It also might have had something to do with how long of a travel day we had which included hiking up Marble Mountain then straight to a 6km walk from the hotel to the Imperial Palace. Seemed like most of us felt that way. Our tour leader mentioned out of all of the guides for the imperial palace that he has had over the years she was the best one and he had hand selected her and booked her for all this tour groups. The guide tried to make it interesting but it came across too serious and repeated herself a lot. I think there is some great stuff to see here but if you can go with out a guide I would take that options. We were only in this town one night and missed out on things that were higher on our list. Which we would have skipped this if we knew this is how it was going to be. If you are here for a short period of time and you have other more important things to see see them first before heading here.

In 1993 this Complex was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It includes many things from the Nguyen Dynasty, such as the Citadel, High Noon Gate, tombs, monuments and much more.

Don't forget to cover up your shoulders & knees or you will be denied entry. It also costs 150,000VND (about $8.90CAD). You are to tip the guide for her services. I believe we tipped her 50,000VND ($3CAD) per couple on our tour."
"A must see if you come to Da Nang. Get your self a private car, we paid 1.5 million round trip. When we got there we also hired a tour guide, if you have a party of 3 or more the math makes sense vs the audio guides. 70 percent of the original buildings were destroyed in 2 wars and the government is slowly rebuilding and restoring sections of it."
Be sure that you give yourself enough time to visit the entire grounds and also important...get yourself a guide who can share with you everything you're seeing and the history. Amazing place...great architecture.
"We visited right after everything reopened post-pandemic. The audio tour option is highly recommended and they offer it in numerous languages. It’s hard to appreciate all the detail without the audio description. The English translation was quite good and it does not cost a lot. The least amount of time you would want to spend there is three hours. The brochure offers a three hour, a half-day, or a full day self-guided tour. Go as early as possible as there is no shade for a good part of the time. The best part about going when they open is that you avoid the crowds to a degree."
"You should go to visit here 1 time when you are in Huế. But remember that take the umbrella or hát with you, so hot with strong sun. Try to explore whole of it, you can hire tourguide, better for you to know. Goodluck!"
"This place is big and it kept our interest, in fact we didn't have enough time to properly explore all of it. We spent 2 hours here. Should have taken food with us. The place we spent most our time was the King's mother's residence, but I'm sure missed a lot of other highlights."
I come here alone but that so amazing. That so mang construction in it. The specialty is the first sight when to entrance the big Gate is NGO MON and the 8 big GUN in front..that a big history of Hue in VIET NAM. high recomend
"The Imperial City was active from 1802 to 1945. The Emporer abdicated '45. Meetings with royalty, emissaries and the like to took place in the Supreme Harmony Palace. The grounds and statuary in and around the citadel are quite beautiful."
"We were fortunate to visit during the Lunar New Year so there was more activity and flowers than ususal. A Dragon Dance complete with burning incense was in progress when we arrived with our guide (I highly recommend using a local guide). We probably spent 2 hours there exploring the various sites.

A moat surrounds the Citadel, which is guarded by a 15 foot high, 10 foot thick stone wall. The grounds are probably about 20 acres . Many of the buildings and gardens were reconstructed after the war. There were many flowers, topiaries, bronz cauldrons, bonsai trees, temples, ornate architecture, gardens, etc.

It is worth your time"
"We stayed in Hue for 2 days & 1 night. I think we could have spent more time here. We did a motorcycle tour, which was excellent and our tour guide was very knowledgeable. He had a great sense of humour and told us many funny stories. We also visited the Imperial City which is steeped in history and again the tour guide gave a thorough outline of the history of the area and the palace. Definitely worth stopping here during a visit to Vietnam"
Spent about 3 hours walking through this amazing palace. Few tourists in March so we could view all the building which have been largely restored following two wars.
It was good to have a guide for this visit. Impressive buildings with fascinating history of the Nguyen dynasty.
"We went by ourselves to the Citadel and hired an Audio guide, so we could go at our own pace. There are several preplanned routes to follow depending on the time you have available. We started off thinking we would do the half day but we so fascinated by everything we were seeing we spent the whole day there. Although there are similarities between some of the different areas, the further you go in the more there is to see. The moat and gardens at the most distant point from the main entrance are particularly good. Although it’s fairly recent history it gives a great insight into a previous dynasty of Vietnam."
"Not for the faint at heart, but well worth a full day to slowly unfold the architectural features of the many historical buildings. Be sure to wear your good walking shoes as the buildings are spaced in a grand sprawling complex. Be sure to see the bonsai's tucked away in the garden area."
Having a guide makes a big difference. We got to listen to a lot of interesting stories that made us wonder how life used to be like living in this Imperial City.
"It was quite quiet when we were here, but suspect that it gets busy early in the day - we went later in the afternoon."
You need to have lots of time to vist as there is so much to see. Great feeling of history and lots of photos to help depict former times
"really good trip. Go go here.
Charismatic and super knowledge of Vietnam was our tour guide Hoa
Martin Denmark"
"By far the (unexpected) highlight of our holiday to Vietnam. Don’t skip it! We only had a day in Hué and this was one of a few things on our list m, but in the end we stayed all day. Not a great deal of shade so be prepared but such an incredible place you HAVE to go!!"
"The Hue Imperial City (The Citadel) is a wonderful place to visit if you’re in Hue. Give yourself a minimum of 3 hours to tour the grounds, as they’re very large. We had a tine constraint, so had to leave before we saw the entire place. It’s gorgeous! Be sure to wear a hat & have water with you. The buildings are beautiful. There are gorgeous gardens & ponds within the grounds. You can buy food to feed the fish. Note: the exit is in a different part of the property than the entrance."
"Didnt go inside any more because of time constraint.but the walk was beautiful. We had coffee in one of cafes near the main area.

This is a must visit when in Hue. We came from the Pagoda via the dragon boat..we were told to get off near the entrance to citadel."
"On the map it looks like a few ruins. Actually there’s lots of buildings that either are original or have been renovated. After 2 hours of wandering around the heat got to us and we had to leave but we hadn’t seen it all. Definitely worth it. Beware, if you buy the combo ticket the other two attractions are a 20 min ride out of town. Unless you plan to do them maybe don’t need the combo."
This is a must see in Vietnam. The large scale and history of this site is magnificent. We only spent a few hours here with a private guide bit you could see so much more. So much history here.
This is a must see in Hue . I would strongly recommend though that you have a guide. I would not have gotten as much out of this without a tour guide.
"This was a really memorable and impressive site to take in, so much to see, it took around three hours to give it justice.
Fortunately the site is flat so the walking was fairly easy. Of all the formal historical sites we visited in our two weeks in Vietnam this was our favourite."
"We recently visited The Citadel / Imperial City. It's a very interesting place with some amazing history and architecture.
We had a private guide to take us through the site (which I would recommend). She was very informative and was happy to answer our many questions.
If in Hue, this is a must visit site.
Allow about 2 hours to see everything.
Currently the virus scare means not many tourists are visiting and its very easy to get around the site."
Lots of history to see and worth a look. The exhibits we well done and easy to understand. The price was right.
"Absolutely beautiful. We bought our ticket as a combo with two of the tombs. It was more expensive than what we had paid for other sites in Vietnam but it is the old city and it is beautiful. Do not underestimate how big it is though you can walk for ages. We spent about 2 hours at the old city wandering around and taking lots of photos. You can hire a guide but we went around on our own and there’s plenty of information explaining exactly what each room/ site was and the importance of it. There’s a few food and drink kiosks around the site slightly more expensive but you are in a tourist site. Its a must do whilst in Hue but it is big and it can get a little repetitive with the buildings looking similar so grab a map of the site, set a route and enjoy."
"What a magnificent treasure Vietnam has with this immense complex. We explored it for 31/2 hours and really only scrapped the surface. Perhaps a pass that lasts for a few days would enable people to come back a couple of times to really appreciate this important piece of history. Thanks so much for the audio guides. Though the ladies giving them out were more interested in their mobile phones than helping their customers!
The architecture is amazing, we sincerely appreciate the imagination and skill that went into building these temples.
We would like to recommend that some of the plastic rubbish lying around be recycled into benches for people to sit on in the shade?
Visitors to Vietnam please do your research and respect their cultures etiquette of covered knees and shoulders and to remove shoes when entering “solemn” places.
Thankfully we had done our research, I carry a little pashmina or jacket and our trousers have zips to make them long or short as required. (Girls - Wrap around skirts are useful too.) I say this because unfortunately our visit was marred by witnessing rude, unprofessional staff saying with VERY angry tone and aggressive body language; “cover, cover” or “no shoes, no shoes”.
We appreciate the Guards (who would have been hot too) must get frustrated when visitors don’t do the right thing however simply saying ”please remove shoes before entering” is not difficult to say to guests who have paid to come in.

The gardens are clearly a work in progress so we would love to come back in a few years to see how they are flourishing."
"This is the Purple Palace built by the Nguyen Dynasty. Folks get ready to do a lot of walking and a lot of reading. This is at the very minimum a 4 to 5 hour tour. We walked every square inch of the palace, read everything there was to read on the Nguyen Dynasty, viewed every building that stood inside the walls and probably still missed a few things. Fortunately, they do have some little cafes in the place to get cold drinks (you will need them) to keep you going. But this is the seat of ancient Vietnam and it is living history. The cost is of entry and the audio is worth it. Take the audio tour. This is going to make your tour a lot more interesting and go a lot more smoothly. An amazing palace that was in use right up until 1946 when the last Emperor Bai Dao was forced to resign the throne and emigrate to France.

Give yourself plenty of time to see the palace.

Enjoy!!!"
"There is much to see when you visit the Citidal, it is a large area with beautiful architecture and artefacts. It gves the impression of the might of the Emporer and reminds me of the Chinesse hidden city."
"Terrific historic site - a must see while in Hue! Plan on spending at least 2 hours - downloaded a website (walking tour of Hue Citadel) that was extremely helpful & informative of the key 7 buildings and area within the Citadel. It was a rainy afternoon (light drizzle) which actually worked out well, as kept the crowds away - felt like we had the place to ourselves and without other tourists getting in our pictures...."
"The Imperial city has been beautifully restores in places and gives a fantastic view in the history of Vietnam. The size and scale of the city is so impressive it is just a shame that so much was destroyed during the wars.
However it is still impressive to see and must go to place to understand the history of Vietnam"
"This was the Place were the emperor lives and had his royal duties until the end of the empire at 1945, it’s quite well conserved, considering the wars the country was involved since this time, It worth the visit ."
"Nothing I had read or seen on YouTube prepared me for the splendour of this place. Though largely reconstructed rather than wholly original it retains an authentic feel, a dreamlike quality which makes it so special. We were luck to be there during coronavirus scare so tourist numbers were very low and it was so peaceful."
"The site is really impressed and wide open. Almost the construction was destroyed by the war however the remaining of the citadel is still worth to visit, they also serve a meal at night with Royal style and Royal taste, you can try if you want but i recommend you to stick with street food which is more cheaper and more reasonable"
"It was interesting, I did enjoy reading the history side of it all. There's a bit of walking around and if visiting historical places are your thing, then take a look. This place isn't for everyone but it does look pretty cool."
You can do the imperial city in 2 hours. Felt a little ripped off as we did a day tour for 200k vnd each. But once on the bus there were entrances tickets to be purchased for an addition 500k vnd
We were lucky that the virus has kept the Chinese and Koreans at home so this was relatively peaceful. Some beautiful architecture and artefacts. Well worth the walking involved.
"If ever you are in Vietnam you need to see this beautiful complex. With amazing buildings, this enormous complex is located right near all the action. Truly a treasure of Vietnam"
"Well worth a visit, so much to see and take in on this site. Amazing architecture and lots of historical panels in English. Lots of interesting buildings of historical value. Would recommend a visit to The Citadel."
Amazing and beautiful. Well worth the trip to Hue. The gardens and water features were stunning. Great for couples looking for a romantic stroll and history aficionados looking for a cultural experience.
"The Palace is a testimony to the pregnant Chinese influence in Vietnam. Buildings organisation is identical to the Forbidden City, but with a touch of Vietnamese colors and ceramics. Fascinating place!
Beautiful gardens too."
"Massively restored in the last few years although you can still see the effects of the fighting during the Vietnam/ American War.
The architecture and craftsmanship is incredible. When you visit Hue you have to visit this place"
"Had one day to do Hue and thought we should tick this off the list. Endless palaces that all look very similar after a while. Audio guide was good but a bit repetitive. Interesting to see pictures and hear the history. Severe lack of food and drink options as you go around, we saw one cafe at the beginning so figured there would be more but instead it was just stalls selling crisps and drinks, why not have a few Banh Mi stands!?"
"Location’s best entertainment for my kids was to feed them all the time, food is available in kind “vending” mashies, make sure you’ve lots of 5000vnd bills"
"We enjoyed our visit to The Citadel, lots to see and lots of walking. We had a guide and we felt we maximised our time here. We asked to see only the highlights and this took over two hours. I personally loved the gardens whilst they are relatively new the landscaping, combination of plants and water are amazing."
"Construction commenced on the Citadel in 1804 under Emperor Gia Long. Using thousands of workers to build the city, its moat and surrounding ten kilometer wall, the brick and stone were added to the packed earth at a later date. Used as the seat of power until the 1880s, when the French government gained control, the Nguyen Dynasty continued here with its ""symbolic traditions"" as the cultural and religious center until 1945. At that time the Purple Forbidden City was vacated and fell into disrepair through neglect and the elements, including cyclones. In 1947 the Viet Minh seized the Citadel, the French counter-attacked and the center of the city was burned, including the Imperial Palace. Further destruction occurred during the Tet Offensive when the People's Army of Vietnam and the Viet Cong soldiers seized the Citadel. Allies bombed the communist's anti-aircraft weaponry, which had been mounted on the Citadel's outer towers. It would be best to read up on the Tet Offensive, as details seem to vary. Ten major sites out of the 160 buildings remain. Preservation and restoration is underway, yet there is much remaining to see. The Citadel protects and encloses the Imperial City, Purple Forbidden City, and the Capital or Civil City, with 10 access gates. The Citadel in an UNESCO World Heritage Site with exquisite architecture and history. The visitor is left with a feeling of remorse and sorrow at the vacant core of the Purple Forbidden City. Wear good walking shoes and spend as much time as you can exploring. Captivating!"
"Just amazing. The craftsmanship of the buildings, and what has remained all these years (even through the wars) is just breathtaking. Absolutely beautiful and yet also so sad how it was destroyed during the war.
A guided tour or an audio tour is recommended, just to get that extra bit of one on one information, but they also have a lot of photos and posters up with information on the history of this beautiful city.
I'm really glad that they have started a restoration project. Even though I think leaving some of the ""scars"" is also important, so that we can also remember what this city had gone through over the years.
There's also a lovely little trinket shop that sells such amazing souvenirs (from little hats to carved lamps and statues!) and incense!
I'm not a person that usually likes incense. My sinus's and allergies go completely mad when I'm around any kind of incense. Or at least that's normally the case. But this stuff! Nothing! I can actually enjoy it's beautiful scents with no negative side-effects!

I would definitely recommend this as a must visit when in Huế."
Impressive citadelle n inner courtyards. Let s get in the story of vietnamese emperors and get canera ready for great pictures
"We took a private car & driver here, arranged by our accommodation.
We paid a lot for an English speaking guide on arrival at Citadel in addition to entry, who ended up being the worst guide I’ve ever experienced. (Do the head phones instead) We also had a Vietnamese man and his two young children in our group so she had to speak Vietnamese and English at the same time. The children misbehaved. The father did nothing. The guide also took on a large group of English speaking people halfway through the tour. She had to repeat everything to them. I could not understand her very well, to be frank. She’s been doing this for too long. Her attitude changed once she realised we had had clothes tailored by her cousin in HoiAn. Give the female guide a miss!

Disgusting toilets here & no paper. Overall experience really disappointing at Citadel. Not a lot to see really. Read up on it prior to going. Allow2-3 hours to walk around."
"The Citadel is the top attraction in Hue and with good reason. The vast area encompasses multiple buildings, gardens and of course history. Extensively damaged during the war, it has been carefully restored. While still a work in progress it is a stunning sight and well worth several hours. Beats Peking’s Forbidden City in its beauty and subtlety."
"When you visit and do not speak Vietnamese please take the guided tour using headphones.

It is a very high quality tour with lots of good insight. Such an amazing place"
"I first came here in 1994, very few visitors and much more raw, but somehow much better than the over restored areas which just seem to be hanging spaces for old photographs, these could do with better explanations and dates as they are obviously intended to be a major part of the visit. This includes the copies of documents relating to French demands etc, what were they?

There are some lovely buildings still to be seen, but we didn’t stay long as it became - to be honest - a little boring.

For the price there should be at least a basic written guide and map, the only map I saw was half way through and easy to miss"
"For only 200,000dong, the Imperial City is a must-see in Hue, with so many beautiful and historically fascinating buildings in one area that we were initially left speechless! My friend and I spent around 6 hours wandering the site, such is the majesty of the complex, and I think this testifies to the fact that although it may seem pricy for a backpacker budget, it is definitely worth the expenditure! It is also incredibly peaceful (potentially due to the Confucius-inspired layout) which makes it a great space to relax as well! Definitely exceeded our expectations :) Also, online info says it is shut Sunday through Wednesday but this is not the case!"
"Excellent place to spend few hours learning about history and way of life of royals in Vietnam. Wonderful architecture in Feng Shui style, it is a must. If you have time visit the tombs too."
"This is a very impressive place to visit. A lot of history and culture to be discovered here and the entire place, buildings, grounds and gardens are beautiful. Especially on a wet day as when we visited. Unfortunately much of this site was destroyed during the various wars and battles - but that which has been restored was done beautifully."
most of this site had been destroyed by the French and Americans so those bits that have been restored are beautifully restored. Cultural history interesting
Should not be missed . A huge sight with some wonderful gardens and large fish filled ornamental lakes.Allow at least half a day.
"We came here on a group tour absolutely loved it so interesting and beautiful to look at lots to see, lots of walking so wear comfortable shoes."
"Nice place with a lot of greenery. A big area with a lot to see. Would recommend the audio guide, otherwise you don't get all the info. You can choose yourself how much time you have or would like to spend here. (1hour, 2_3hours, whole day)"
"Thought I'd share some of my thoughts after a visit to the Citadel. I have to say that the information on Trip Advisor is pretty thin so I hope to help other travelers. When purchasing the ticket you are offered some options. These include visits to the different tombs surrounding the Citadel. You can pay up to VD 570000 D to visit all of them how to get. Unfortunately I couldn't get a clear explanation about what the tombs were so I just opted for the pass into the Citadel for 200,000 VD. Turns out that was the right choice for me. I also picked up headphones for the guided audio tour for another 100,000 VD. The guided tour has 60 locations. If you make all 60 in a day you should enter in a marathon.

Before you start do what I didn't do. Find out when the live music and dance performances are. It looks like there are live performances around 10 am and 3 pm daily at the theater. If you do what I did and followed the audio guide map chronologically you will miss the performances (like I did).

As with other reports there are cafe's and toilets and plenty of opportunities to buy souvenirs of course. The Citadel tour is amazing and I was exhausted with the information and the exquisite beauty of the place. I think I learned more about Vietnam's history today than in my lifetime. Incredible and fascinating. By closing I could not take in another reference.

So my advise is take a whole day to see the Citadel, use the audio guide and plan the schedule to see the performances. Enjoy!"
"A fabulous place to spend a whole morning
Easy to get around on your own we preferred it !with our trusty lonely planet book in hand
There were videos in English superbly documented
Every corner you turned there was more and more to see
You can get limited drinks inside and a couple of coffee shops near entrance and exit
A lovely craft workshop reasonable prices too
We went into main gate and did the anti-clockwise direction all around worked well there are toilets but take your own toilet paper !
Well worth the 400000vd for 2 people
Taxis outside plentiful and metered
Enjoyed it a lot"
"Very interesting place
Did it in a group with a very knowledgeable guide
Spent hours there so plenty of walking
Wear comfortable shoes
We thought that it was nicer than the Forbidden City in Beijing (different but based on it)"
"On one hand, this place had similar vibes to the Forbidden City in Beijing. However, there are marked differences between the two. One, while the southern ares is streamlined, the northern area of the citadel was a lot more hands off, and you could explore the areas you wanted. Two, while the FC in Beijing largely undergoes restoration, much of the Imperial Citadel in Hue is in disrepair, with some walls even retaining bullet holes from the Vietnam War. If you are in Hue, check this place out."
"Was very impressed with the imperial city, we spent about 3 hours there with the first hour guided. A couple of recommendations:
1)We hired a driver as we were coming from Hoi An. The cost was about $65USD total and he was fantastic, he stopped all the places you wanted to and knew the standard itinerary for tours so you didn’t have to direct. I would recommend this as an option as the drive is 3 hrs each way and this was much better than being on a tour bus or mini van. And a private tour was quoted at $120USD per person 😯
2) Hire a guide vs the audio guide. An audio guide was $100k for each person, where a personal guide of the city for an hour was $150K total. You pay for the guide at the ticket station, and before you go into the city you will see on the right the guide room (audio room is on the opposite side)
3) Have cash, no ATMs anywhere near any of the attractions

Would highly recommend going if you have the time. We selected to leave at 7am and was back in Hoi An at 6pm. With lots of stops along the way for pictures."
"Place is huge and it is like stepping to the history. We spent about 1.5 hours there. We enjoyed it.
Single ticket is now 200,000 dong. We bought combo with 2 tombs, it was 420,000 dong. Combo with 3 tombs is 530,000 dong. Something like that. Or each tomb is 150,000 dong."
"Very impressive site with fascinating history
We did this ourselves with audio guides however we noted that the official guides were language based and very informative
Video displays help with your information

This is at least a half day trip so bring good walking shoes, a hat and sun protection
We are well travelled and both ended up with T-shirt tan....dull and cloudy when we left the hotel, basic error
The buildings are impressive and although some parts of the site are being renovated it didn’t detract from our enjoyment of discovering the Chin/Vet dynasties
Loved the huge carp in the waterways within the Citadel

Plenty of refreshment areas and rest rooms throughout this extensive site that is surrounded by a huge moat
If you are in Hue this is a must see"
We visited and had a great guide that explained the history of the tomb and did a good tour. Very interesting place to visit and would recommend to see.
"I would not recommend this as a day trip from Hoi An. It’s way to far away (3 hours there & 3 hours back) in what was an uncomfortable, cramped mini van with 10 others. And you need an overnight to see things properly. There are a couple of stops on the way - a view from the mountain pass, a visit to one of the Emperor’s tomb, a very nice pagoda overlooking the river and then a short 30 minute & rather uninteresting river boat ride, before stopping at a restaurant in Hue the for what was a tasty lunch, (a set menu included in the tour) for one hour.

Then the purpose of the trip to visit the Imperial City in Hue of the previous 13 Vietnamese Emperors. Part of it is still intact including the impressive throne room (no photos in this part allowed) but the Forbidden City (living quarters) was destroyed by the Americans during the Vietnam/ American War. Two hours are spent walking around here which is not long enough.

And then it’s the three hour ride back.

If you really want to do it then hire a driver & a car & do it privately at your own pace & in more comfort. But better still stay overnight in Hue and get to see much more and longer."
"Impressive place, history rich. Expensive for the budget travelers to get inside (420 k for the three places)"
We approached this visit with some reservations as many other reviews were somewhat negative. We found it to be wonderful. The large scale of the site allowed for endless discovery of quiet corners and hidden gems with little sense of the other visitors once you get away from entrance and early attractions. You get a real sense of the life in the palace and the workings of the elite city. Some careful restoration work coupled with the substantial amount of remains (despite the ravages of American bombs and age) makes for several hours of immersive experience. This is further enhanced by occasional video presentations which are highly informative. A great place to touch the soul of Vietnam. Look in particular for the mother’s house and the Royal Theatre. Give yourself plenty of time.
"The area is well preserved. You can imagine how the Kings ruled country, royal family and other customs in the citadel.
Something like go back time to 17th century :D"
"The Citadel, home of the Vietnamese kings, is one of the greatest places to visit in Vietnam. Much of it was destroyed by war and weather, but the government has undertaken a major restoration. The Citadel is spread over a large area and requires walking significant distances. It is best to view the Citadel with a guide and allow at least 3 hours."
"We had a guided walking tour of the Imperial City. This encompasses the Citadel and the Forbidden Palace. We really enjoyed the visit. There is so much to see and learn about Vietnamese history. From the time of the Emperors and their wives, concubines and children up to almost the present day as it was the scene of heavy fighting during the Têt offensive and there are remaining craters and missing buildings to remember that time.

The introduction video is really well done and the restoration and preservation has been excellent. The museum at the end is very interesting too with displays of beautiful ceramics, furniture and textiles."
"Be prepared to walk, but this is a must do experience. It is all on the flat but the Imoerial City covers quite an area and it can be quite hot. There are however plenty of watering holes discreetly placed along the way. The whole sure gives one an impression of the history and culture of early Vietnam and its fascinating. Plenty of lovely pagodas to wonder through, marvelous gardens and lots of photos and information along the way. We walked there but on leaving we were glad to see a li e of the excellent Mai Linh taxis waiting outside ."
"The Citadel is so interesting, pity that much has been destroyed by war, neglect and weather.
Is an awesome sight with much to see including the bonsais, the gardens and the moats.
Much of it has been reconstructed but still you can see the way of life of the Emperor and his family and also considering that, in the end, was built rather recently (1800 circa). Probably the most interesting thing to see in Hue (pity the weather though!)."
Even many parts of the palace was destroyed by the war it is still worth a visit. It portray the life style of the emperor in the past.
"No visit to Hue is complete without a visit to the Imperial City.

The compound and it's history is fascinating but it's the architecture that is really memorable.

Visiting the Imperial City in the morning will put later visits to tombs into context but I would also recommend returning once it's gone dark as it's really well lit and very peaceful compared to the city centre."
"As soon as we all entered the citadel, all of our group were struck by all the colorful flowers in every part. The palace itself (or, unfortunately, what’s left of it after all the destruction caused during wars) is worth the visit by itself, but the gardens add so much to the location."
Slowly being rebuilt after destruction during Tet offensive in 1968. Similar to Beijing’s Forbidden City but smaller.
"The site of the royal palace after the move south from hanoi. Around 1 square metre of inner courtyard where the king would meet his mandarins and hold court and where his 100 wives and 124 lived. Our guide explained the various rooms and what they were used for, you can also get an audio guide which might have been more easy to understand..."
"It's supposed to be a grand structure for its status. Other than the entrance area, the interior seemed not as outstanding. There was not much ground to explore inside. The best of the citadel could offer to visitors was the well maintained plant and tree. The colourful dressing added to the attraction significant charm and beauty. Entrance fee is high for what's offered but you can't really name more tourist point to visit other than this in Hue. Tombs might be worse in terms of value."
"Plenty of time is required to enjoy this beautiful old citadel where several royal buildings still remain. The place is enormous and there is just so much to see and enjoy. Dress comfortably and carry water, it is essential."
You could easily spend all day here - really interesting and beautiful gardens. We stayed about 4 hours - the price is 200K VD which is about £7. You can get food and drinks inside and the toilets are clean.
The citadel in Hue is enormous and surrounded by a high wall. It’s a good way to escape the traffic noise and pollution and it has nice quiet gardens as well as old buildings with lots of information in English as well as Vietnamese. Worth a few hours of your trip.
"Give yourself plenty of time to explore the city,take water and wear comfortable shoes,there is lots to see"
"Places to visit the Imperial Citadel are very beautiful and interesting. Architecture is especially not the same. Walking around and between walls to explore temples, buildings and others is very nice. Some places are, where you can stay and enjoy the royal feeling."
"We visited the tombs and more in the city, the citadel is the most interesting. Besides the building, spectacular architecture, some of the gardens, most notably a Japanese style garden with plenty of bon sai trees. I think it was important to have a guide, we would have not enjoyed equally much without."
The citadel is very good for the one who likes historical building and stories. By visiting this place we learn and know the history of Vietnam
"Prices have been raised to 200k. Would not recommend going without a guide since there was very little information around to give you much context to the place. We tried to read bits from Wikipedia as we went through but wasn’t that helpful.
Hard to believe that the entrance fee for here is more than entry for Killing Fields and S-21...!"
"Take a full day and visit the imperial city while you are in Hue. You can spend an entire morning or afternoon just walking the city and exploring every location within the walls. I recommend staying at the vinpearl hotel, it was a quick 10 minute walk to the gates of the city."
Not much to.do in Hue. We .managed to waste an hour here before moving on to another touristy place.
We didn't allow enough time. Such a large beautiful space to cover. So beautiful. We are coming back to Hue next year so we can see it more fully. On the way out we stopped for the VR experience. Very good.
"This place has many different aspects of it, not to mention the grounds its self are huge. You could easily spend hours or days wandering around looking. It takes you back to a different time and paints a grandeur picture of the life of a dynasty. We were on a group tour and I felt it went to quick to really look at different artifacts and to admire the details of the carvings. I suggest you do a bit of research and find the things you really want to see, especially if you're on limited time."
Half a day there would be necessary. One moment to visit and one moment just to sit and feel the atmosphere around.
"The area is huge and there is a lot to see. Though, there are almost no signs describing what you see and therefore our visit felt quite pointless. We did not find the architecture or gardens very impressive. Also, the entrance fee is quite expensive (200 000 VND/person)."
I spent a good four hours here and could have spent more. Wonderful place - make sure you take a long skirt and scarf to cover your shoulders/knees in some buildings. Water is available inside and fairly cheaply-and there is shade. Contrary to a lot of blogs!!
"In all honesty I thought it was expensive for what it was.
The gardens were delightful & the pagodas & buildings that still remained were really beautiful but for me that was about it.
There were no maps left so we just sort of wandered around for a couple of hours. I found there was VERY limited information available at the sites unless you paid extra for a guide or the audio guide which was frustrating when it was already expensive to gain entry.
150,000VND per person."
"This is a must see for when visiting Hue.
Wonderful history and buildings. Spent 4 hours wandering around, we did not have a guide but saw everything. It’s amazing seeing these places"
"Really vast, got lost a few times. Unfortunately we've seen enough historical sights in Asia to not be wowed anymore, nevertheless, still worth a tour."
This place is packed with history and is very unassuming. We didn't realise how big and vast the whole place was. So I'd recommend setting aside at least 2 hours to get through it all. Getting a guide to explain the exhibits will definitely enhance your experience as there is limited write ups. Comfy shoes recommended too!
"Spent hours roaming through the Citadel , just vast . Hard to imagine how it was in the past . Well worth spending half a day here ."
"The area is really big and well worth it for the price. As we are always quite interested in history, this was a great place and gave a bit of an insight about the ancient Vietnam. You should certainly plan half a day at least as the area is quite big."
"Free for locals on Tet and 200,000 for foreigner. Used to be free then they increased or to 50,000 but now at 200,000 it's frankly not worth it"
"This was really amazing place with a lot of history. We had Hung as our local guide and learnt so much about life of royal family especially about 13 Kings, Eunuchs, Wives and Concubines of the Emperors. We especially impressed with Hung's Knowledge of daily life in forbidden city and stories about how they did to become eunuchs and their life as well. Highly recommend to visit Citadel with Hung from Adventure Journey."
Very large Imperial palace. Or Vietnam's forbidden city. Home of the past Emperor and wife and prince and maybe the in laws. Buildings for the Concubines and a Theater and a few Temples. This fortress has four entrances and two water motes. Built over a hundred and fifty years. Not much is left standing after all the wars with the French and America's but enough to really give you a good idea of the grandeur and beauty of this palace. Plan on about 3 to 4 hours and its better to have a guide to get the most out of it. Good for the entire family.
"Really really beautiful, and lovely to wander about. Luckily, it was not crowded and we were able to spend an afternoon.

Keep in mind that some areas are considered holy, and therefore have some rules for visitors to obey. I.e covering the shoulders, chest and knees, and hats are to be taken off.

Definitely worth a visit!"
"A visit to the Imperial City made possible by the tour group I was travelling with. The Imperial City is one of those attractions that ranks between average and very good. We were sourced with a local guide to make the visit more interesting and have our questions answered. Make the most of your visit here and ensure you have a tour guide.

Although mostly open for pedestrian traffic, at a certain time they allow cars and scooters in, which makes it a dangerous voyage out of the Imperial City back to the tour bus at the parking lot."
"A very pleasant, park-like place to escape the city and stroll around. The “Purple City” is quite interesting, although it was badly damaged by wars. The a/v presentation featuring virtual reconstructions tucked away in the Dien Thai Hoa should really be seen to fully appreciate the site. Reconstruction is underway, and significant progress has been made in the four years since my last visit. Palace grounds feature many lovely and quiet corners to enjoy and stroll around. Several of the galleries feature historic photos of the palace and imprrial ceremonies."
"Visiting the imperial city, citadel and forbidden city of Hue is definitely a must-see in Vietnam. We were happy about our decision to visit it on our own (but with a good guide book), to make the time for it as we spent 5 hours walking around this part of Hue. We loved discovering the different remains. Plan a day if you want to explore all the gems of the imperial city. Enjoy!"
We were taken for a detailed tour by our Tour guide Thien. The search for knowledge was amazing and our guide was cool and calm. Thankyou Thien. We enjoyed your company.
"Quite a large site with some ruins, some reconstructed buildings, some original buildings and a couple of lovely gates. The Imperial City, as the name would suggest, also contains the Royal Palace. We visited with our tour guide, which was interesting as it enabled us to find out more about the history of the Imperial City. Some lovely architecture and plenty of photo opportunities. You cannot really miss this when in Hue."
"This large 200 plus year old complex, which suffered damage during conflicts, has impressive architecture and interesting gates, temples, halls and palace. The red lacquered columns in the palace, the detailed ceilings and murals, plus gigantic urns, gardens and courtyards all are worth some time exploring."
We walked to the citadel and paid our tickets which are almost 7 pounds and paid a further 3 pounds for the remote control and headphones for a self controlled tour which was ideal as we did what we wanted and not. dragged around by the flag bearers.
"Hue have rain season in around October till December. This time is the low visiting season but it’s the great time to relax, quite in every where. You can take time to visit and take pics. Remember bring your raincoat and umbrella. I love the rain"
Wonderful place to visit. Amazing ancient buildings fit to be on Unesco. The deco and carving on the canopy above the Throne is awesome.
"We hired a car to drive us from Da Nang to Hue, we reached Hue before noon. When we arrived at the Imperial City gates, many trishaw cyclists came up to us and offered to bring us around to see the city. The charges were calculated by hours. We decided to get a ride because the heat was too much for us, we could hardly open our eyes, needless to say to walk under such hot temperatures, we won't be able to explore much by foot. So we started our exploration around the Imperial City, we were cycled around under an umbrella. We got to visit many old houses, schools and museums for free. The cyclists cum guides were able to speak English, they were knowledgeable and were able to explain the history behind all the places they brought us to. We saw bullet holes too. Take note, please negotiate the charges beforehand, we had an argument in the end. It was no doubt the best English guide I encountered during my trip to Da Nang, Hue and Hoi An. They deserve more but they hope to get more money by cheating you a little, just be careful and aware before getting on.

After visiting the outer part, now we paid to enter the Imperial City, Citadel. Same thing, the place inside was huge, the weather was unbearable. We ran from shade to shade. There were buggy rides inside the city but you will have to pay extra and wait in line to get on one. We, the young ones, only explored 10% of the city and had a few stops for drinks and icecreams. My parents totally gave up walking, they waited at the exit. If you were to visit, remember to bring your own umbrella, carry water and put on sunglasses. This place is massive and you really need some courage to walk every room and see everything. You can get paper map at the ticketing counter, you will need it to find your way out, don't get lost!"
"This is an impressive 500m x 600m walled citadel that made up the Imperial City where for about 150 years the emperors of Vietnam resided.

Ongoing renovations are improving the experience. Those buildings and gardens that have been renovated are beautiful.

Tickets can be purchased at the gate for entry into the Imperial City alone or multiple sites that include emperors’ tombs."
The Imperial Palace site was awesome and one could actually imagine how it must have looked in its heyday. Dioramas and mannequins re-enact the scenes of days gone by. Do stop and listen to the audio commentary on tv screens placed at certain points in the site. These are helpful and informative.
"This is a must must visit to understand the deeper meaning of this great country of Vietnam. Very vast and elaborate place of both workshop and history. No need for guide, best to rent an audio guide and take your time. Otherwise, guides rush you around and only see what they want you to see.this would be 1-2 hours visit. Spend a few minis of contemplation in one of the Buddha temples inside. Remember no pictures and take your shoes off. Very powerful and clear place."
"Hue Imperial City is a must! You can easily spend hours exploring the sprawling complex of beautiful, historic buildings. It's gauranteed to impress travelers (even those who don't normally like tourist attractions)."
Have a relaxing trip at this cultural heritage site. A must visit attraction for tourists visiting Hue city.
Citadel is one of the must go place in Vietnam to understand the royal and traditional part of Vietnam's history.
"Very family friendly with lots to see and do, at times it gets a little same same depending on what your looking for and you guide. It's a must do on the bucket list but take your time as not much on display that's amazing."
Allow plenty of time to see this. It covers a large area. It's best to buy your ticket at the gate. You can also buy a ticket that includes the two tombs in Hue or a two day ticket that includes the pagoda nearby
"Highly recommend to visit raining season with rain coat as much comfortable weather. Summer time is crazy hot.
All historic building and story is definitely worthy to visit and spend at least 3 hrs in there. Beautiful architecture and story."
"Our guide took us to the imperial city so it was great to hear the history and the stories of the palace. I however saw many tourist with headphones so if travelling without a guide there is still ways of finding out the history. In part of the garden they had a group of musicians playing traditional instruments which we really enjoyed. Beautiful buildings, could not miss this attraction."
"shame what several waves of trips did to the buildings, but the site still very much deserves a visit.
Some building are being rebuild, but I don t know how faithful that reconstruction is."
"Fascinating history and architecture, easy to access. Best to have a guide to give you the historical context of the place."
"It is easy to get lost wandring in the maze-like place, it is a huge area but it can be covered in a few hours to half a day. Some building are well kept/restored, some are not so well kept and some are entirely missing, but nevertheless it is an enchanting place. There are sign posts in some places making it possible to visit on your own, but it will probably be more interesing with a guide. The entrance ticket can be bought in combination with the royal tombs to a discounted price, so if you plan to also visit the tombs, this will save you a few dollars."
Having an informative guide for this is important. We also went to the Royal tombs which was also great.
Nice place for walking along. You can spend a whole afternoon there and enjoy the sights. Do hire a guide or audiotour as it adds much information to the different structures.
This was awesome. We done The Citadel with a tour group which was fantastic as our guide Long was awesome and also spent most of his time with our 4 yr old son. The is so much history and so much to see that we went back on one of our days off again. A must to visit when in Vietnam.
"If you want to travel back in time, you must came and visit Hue Imerial City. It’ one of the best sightseen in Vietnam."
This was both a cultural and historical place to visit. The architecture was very interesting. Was a good walk around.
"This is my second time in the Citadel, and I learn new things about it all the time. So much history and so much to explore. Highly recommended."
"An interesting place to visit with intricate details on the buildings. A large area so you need a lot of time and energy to cover it all. There are plenty of places to buy food and drinks throughout at reasonable prices. There were so many tourists, they thinned out around lunch time as the tour groups leave then so this may be a good time to visit to avoid the crowds."
"Some interesting buildings and pretty gardens. Definitely worth a look as it’s quite inexpensive (200,000 VND per person), but a lot of the buildings are poorly maintained. I would advise stumping out the extra 100,000 for the audio tour, as otherwise there isn’t much explanation of what things are."
"We visited the place. It is few, but enough wooden buildings of 200 years old, chineese style. All empty except the temples. Some with places to put objects but still empty, so at the end, it is just some gardens.
The audioguide is the most boring useless things. You stop listening for sure after 3 or 4 numbers.
Worth it just cos it is vietnam.
U can take some nice pictures though"
"The Hue Citadel is very large, which took us nearly 2 hours to explore the whole spot. When you visit this historical site, you will have a better understanding of the Nguyen Dynasty as well as the massive architecture here. Traveling with tour guides is highly recommended."
Amazing place - comfortable walk and plenty of places to amble around at your leisure away from the tour groups.
"For us seeing the Imperial City was a definite yes. We expected it to be much grander and more interesting since it is so famous. Honestly there is nothing to see inside. The tickets are very expensive, do not include an audio guide and it is plain boring. They are trying to restore the place which is not going well in my opinion. The only things that might be interesting are the photos on the wall. But come on, I didn't come here to see photos but the actual place. I was pretty surprised when I saw a modern day tennis court at the palace...We literally spent 30 minutes here, it was that bad and disappointing. If you are in Hue please check out the other sights since they are much more interesting. This place is a waste of time and money."
Extraordinary as we wandered through the gardens and halls of this regal palace aught in another time. Its was raining heavily on the day but did not put us off with umbrellas in hand we discovered as much as we could and sat in awe at the collection of Bonzi trees. From the hustle and bustle of Hue once you enter the walls of this Imperial city the noise slips away as you discover history in every direction. We only had two hours and would have gone back with more time! #Mustsee
"Magnificent view of the Vietnam Emperors recent lifestyle and also their routine respects. Though the place is abandoned or refurnished but many pictures to show the youngest shortest Emperor that reign the country, cannons etc."
Beautiful citadela where you can walk around and feel like you are in ancient ages. Perfect for travelers who are looking for culture outside of the city and scape of the western touch of vietnam.
"Very interesting, beautiful and peaceful. We ha a beautiful painting made here. It is huge so didn't seem crowded even with a lot of people."
Beautiful palace. Very well renovated. Nice to walk around. Lovely buildings. Definitely not to miss in Hue. Count 1h30 to 2h to visit without rushing.
"I wasn’t expecting much but it is honestly beautiful and you absolutely must see it if you’re in Hue even for 1 day.
You could easily spend 5 hours here. But you can do the best of it in about 2.5 hours.
I would have loved to have spent more time just sitting in one of the many gardens and relaxing."
"Highly recommended. You can spend easy half a day in it. It huge so tourists are spread out and except in the central part it is quite peaceful. (We were there in December). There is a lot of vegetation and it is also nice to be away from the traffic.
We also ate a Bun from Hue at the cafeteria and it was surprisingly good especially for this kind of place in a big tourist spot."
"We visited Hue only to visit the Imperial city and it did not dissappoint. I had been craving Vietnamese history which was absolutely provided during this tour. It was a good segway to understanding the nuances in Vietnamese history.

I would definitely recommend visiting the Imperial city."
There is a audio guide in several languages for this attaction. The area is really huge so we took more than an hour to explore the place. Its rich in history and culture of Vietnam. Worth visiting.
We stopped at Hue to visit the citadel's and they were truly impressive. Consider buying the group ticket with the tombs - works out better. Also get a bottle of water before entering the premises. The visit easily takes more than a couple of hours and the architecture is splendid
"Complex is very nice and you can spend 1-2 hours there. There are several diferent buildings, definitely worth a visit."
"We got our whole day package through the hotel service and it was a while day with the Forbidden City in the Citadel in the morning, a pagoda with a lake view, a dragon boat trip across the lake to lunch, the imperial tombs in the afternoon and a short stop for souvenirs and crafts demonstrations before heading back to the hotel. It was the expertise of our guide however that made the otherwise pleasant tour a memorable experience. Mr Hung gave us a brief but detailed historucak account in an entertaining narrative conversation form that put everything in context. I highly recommend him"
"We spent a good 90mins strolling around the Citadel, accompanied by our English-speaking knowledgeable guide.
We'd brought umbrellas, and were so pleased we'd not cancelled the tour because of the weather.
The more care and time we put into visiting this kind of destination, the more we enjoy it. Not much point in gazing at buildings and artefacts if we don't know anything about them. So we read every sign, listen to and ask questions of our guide, and absorb as much as we can. It really makes a visit worthwhile and so much more interesting.
The Citadel is an amazing complex, rich in history and detail. Try to visit every part of it, as we did, if you have time.
Much is on the level, but there are steps and stone staircases too. Several toilets. And it's not been overly-commercialised, which makes a nice change.
Definately worth visiting - we loved this visit."
The imperial city is the most important landmark in Hue and the reason to visit the city. Dotted with temples and places you can an easily spend half a day there.
"We went here as part of a one day city tour with Brothers Travel Agency. Our guide Trinh did her tour in Vietnamese and English. Her English is excellent and she is very knowledgeable.

The Imperial city is big with lots to see. There are additional activities that are optional inside that you could do if you have time (dress up and have a photo on the throne, show in the theatre). There is an additional cost for these activities."
I visited solo and opted for the audio guided tour of the Citadel. I did the morning tour and probably beat the crowds. I was easily able to follow the map provided and use the audio device allowing me to have some incidental exercise and enjoy the tour at my own pace while still being able to learn of the history and beauty.
"Asia is known for having a lot of temples, buddhas, and things along these lines to visit, and this is another one.

However the pure size of this is mind blowing, looking down on this from a map you can see the size of it, the pure square cut out of Huê, and it’s worth a visit if you’re staying here.

You do have to pay to enter, which is normal. But you can spend a good 3/4 hours walking around this and still not see it all, it’s not used as anything more than a tourist attraction now however so you will be one of many visiting and taking photos.

But worth a visit for sure."
Very nice and interesting place to visit. But hard to find an easy way inside to visit everything without missing any temple
"We only had a chance to get to the citadel in the late afternoon, which in hindsight wasn't enough time to fully absorb the entirety of this place.

It was quite a peaceful place, so it was nice to wander the extensive grounds. We didn't do an audio tour, so we did miss a lot of the historical information regarding the citadel. There were plenty of notices to read so we were able to gain an understanding of the place.

If you are going here, give yourself some time to look around and possibly get the audio tour."
"Book the night train - YOURSELF with bookaway! I discovered it to late and booked at a travel agency. They sold me a four soft bed cabin; reality was a 6 hard bed.

It’s a nice area to see. It’s very huge and you need 1-2 hours at least."
"The imperial city is big and beautiful. We spent 2.5 hours there, and it worth visiting. You can buy a package tour that you can visit 3 sites including the tombs."
"The history behind the Imperial city, is amazing, the amount of space set aside for a king is unbelievable, in a country where the common man are living on top of each other. The architecture and set out is great, we could have spent all day wandering it’s many buildings and gardens, but were on a tight tour schedule. Would definitely come here again if we get back to Hue"
"Great visit, really enjoyed this and the history around this. It's worth stopping by to see this site."
"Spent the morning dawdling around the City in an attempt to understand what the people must have felt at the time, impossible. It was a fascinating place with great displays."
"I wasn't expecting much from the citadel and thought I would be done in an hour. I ended up spending 3 hours and could have easily stayed longer. Highly recommend the audio tour for 100,000 dong, well worth it. And the tour has three options for short, medium and long tours. It can get hot so take time out for a cool drink or ice cream at many little cafes."
"It's a nice place to visit for an hour or so. There's lots of places and hidden nooks. Many places recommended an afternoon but unless you love temples, I'm not sure you need it."
"Great experience, you'll feel the beauty and greatness of the Vietnam emperror up to 1945.
Hugh area, easy a hole day"
"Enjoyed walking around the Imperial City. Interesting architecture and history. Pretty grounds. We walked from our hotel on the other side of the river, a ways, but a nice stroll. On the way back we took a rickshaw bike. Wow, can those guys maneuver through traffic!"
"This place is very serene yet still maintains its solemnity after almost 200 years. I especially love the Fengsui of this citadel and most of historic places in Hue, a great harmony of lake, mountain and human."
"I visited the Hue Imperial City with my intrepid tour. It was very interesting. Of course you need to cover your shoulder and knees. I did see a number of Asian tourists that didn’t comply with that and sometimes the guards were okay but not always.

The structures are quite extensive and it is really interesting to see."
I'm glad we visited in winter only because the cool breeze was a blessing. The place is so beautiful and an easy walk. The gardens near the mosaics are amazing an a must to visit. There is a coffee shop but I found the coffee tasted burnt so wouldn't recommend it really.
"We went to the imperial city right after a badly seeped night in the sleeping bus to Hue so we're a little bit tired... Maybe we should have rested more because this magnificent place is huge and you have to walk a lot. Said that, we enjoyed very much this magnificent imperial complex, with more than a hundred buildings inside, beautiful gardens and even a really nice crafts shop."
"Great place to spend a few hours. Even better away from the pushy sellers in town which was the first time we experienced this in vietnam despite being in 5 other places prior to hue.

We got the 4 site pass for 330k, or there's a 3 site option for around 250k and single site for 150k.

This place is huge and you can walk around without seeing other people if you go late afternoon like we did"
Very good but enormous site and lots of walking! Make sure you have water and have downloaded a google map as it’s quite confusing.
"Beautiful and peaceful. A must see when visiting Hue.

However, disgusting toilets in female WC. Two of the three had hundreds of loads flies on them and therefore were unusable, the other had a bad door and I was locked in and had to bang the door very hard to force it open. There was a rude staff member at one of the few shops who barely looked up to eventually tell me that there were no toilets anywhere, even though there was.

Please note if you have driven yourselves to the imperial city, you enter on the south side but have to exit on the east side so there will be a walk to or from your vehicle wherever you are parked."
"If you have been to China and visited their imperial palace, then this is chicken feed. Of course this must be part of the tour package in Hue, furthermore we think that China must have some influence in their architecture of this palace"
"Very well laid out the old complex, reasonable walking areas, could do with some maintenance of pathways internally, the old buildings are worth seeing"
Interesting to explore the palace and learn about Vietnam's imperial history. There is audio guide available and music performance of the imperial theatre. You will enjoy this if you like history and culture.
"Spent the day been educated and informed about the incredible history of Hue. Our Guide for the day was Van, and she was terrific! Her English is excellent and she has a terrific sense of humor. The food was excellent. Van was very caring and made it a good day."
"We bought 2 passes for here and tombs costing 720,000 dong expecting change of 280,000 I passed the change to my husband and walked towards the enterance he counted 180,000 in small notes making it appear more he turned back to query of short change she was watching us carefully and immediately passed us 100,000 dong with out questioning why we had returned also knew the exact short change!! Please check your change just a rip off
Inside was good but some of the restoration was poor quality"
"Get there with your walking shoes on if you want to see it all. We walked about an hour in hot humid weather which makes the complex less nice. Two notes:
The exit is not the entrance. So don’t cirkel back like we did.
And the vr experience is 50.000 dong and a funny experience."
Stunning place that need for sure more than 6 hours. That much we stayed and we could stayed for more if not close. Beautiful gardens with a lot of temples that brings you back on time. We travel with young children and they had great time feeding the birds and fishes in the ponds. Also hanging around so much green was very refreshing. Beautiful place and a must while you are in Hue.
"Despite the fact that it was still being restored, I wasn't expecting it to be so huge! I expended around 4 hours visiting the whole place. Loved every corner of it, and I strongly recommend reserving half day to walk around it. If also visiting the temples in Hué, pay for the combined ticket; they didn't take cards though."
"Very impressive and in very good condition, a huge place in the centre of Hue. You cannot go to Hue and not visit this place."
"We found it really beautiful and well organised, good information signs, clean, easy access to snacks, drinks and WC.
If you go, DONT MISS THE VR-Studio.
It’s 5 min but really good. Even our 3-year old loved it!"
"Gorgeous gardens that are very relaxing. Cool to see the historic structures, but the audio guides need to be improved."
"A stunning, amazing place. A haven for lovers of landscape, gardens and bonsai. Some pretty good architecture and great historic context. If your in Hue, this is a must. You could spend al day here. Allow 3 hours minimum."
This is definately worth taking the time to see. We paid extra for the audio guide which I highly recommend to get the most out of the visit.
"The Citadel has a very interesting history. It gives a good glimpse of over 400 years of history. This place is huge and very beautiful, very old administrative area of Vietnam and currently it only has a few remaining architectural buildings. Highly recommend to spend a few hours to look."
"even if mostly reconstructed, the Citadel (former Royal Palace) is an impressive compound of palaces and temples, gardens and ponds. we loved it to stroll around up and down, left and right, all the time discovering some new details.
There is a combo ticket with the entrance to the palace and to two major tombs located a bit out of the city. the ticket is valid for two days and costs 280K p.P. Definitely worth it, if you have time to go for the tombs."
"We had a nice ride on a Dragon boat on the river, then we arrived at the Hue Imperial City.

Boat dock took credit cards, and had restrooms/WC, staff were very nice.

At the docks to the Imperial City, there were steps leading to the entrance, and the grounds were very well kept.

Lots of interesting art and architecture.

The grounds and buildings were full of period pieces of Vietnamese culture/history, very colorful, unique, and incredible to view.

Take your time, enjoy the site, there is a lot to take in. Not much for kids/young adults to do, so just prepare yourself.

Have a great time....

Mahalo"
"Amazing buildings, huge place a must see in hue!!!! The building is absolutely gorgeous!! Oh the danasty really have talent building this place nice"
Be prepared to walk a lot. A smaller version of the Forbidden CIty in Bejing; but I found the decoration and architecture to be more appealing.
"This Citadel which was built by help of the French and partially destroyed in the American War. It is slowly being rebuilt by international and American.

An historic place that must be visited on a trip to Hue."
"The Citadel has a very interesting history. It gives a good glimpse of over 400 years of history. You will love the architecture, the symmetry and the how defensive military strategy influenced the planning of the Imperial city. You need a guide for information.Also gives a glimpse of French influence."
This is a must visit place if you go to Hue! The place is huge and is very beautiful. Make sure to allot at least 2 hours to fully enjoy the sights and the history of the whole citadel. Most tourist would just go to 1 or 2 places inside but do not do this - you will be missing a lot!
"The Hue City tour was suggested for us by our homestay because we were a little bit tired & this was all inclusive, we didn’t need to get cabs between sights, pay entrance fees or think about what to see or where to eat lunch. It included some of the best sights/experiences in Hue & all we had to do was be downstairs for the van to pick us up.

It was a small group tour with a maximum of 12 people in a comfortable mini van. When we went there were only 8 of us so we had fun chatting to the other guests.

Nhi was our guide & she was outstanding. Excellent English skills & a great deal of knowledge that she was so passionate about sharing. We really enjoyed the day & I would suggest it rather than going around in your own."
"Stunning and powerful beyond measure. The folks knew what they were doing with the architecture here. Get the 150k dong ticket and I IMPLORE YOU TO EXPLORE THE PERIPHERY of the city. It is quiet, poetic and quaint."
"This place is vast. You can spend half a day exploring the many palaces and pavilions and wandering the landscaped grounds. For me the gardens were the best part, miniature landscapes in the Chinese style, and many fine bonsai. Admission 150 K dong and worth it. This privileged enclave, cut off from the people by massive walls, is a great advertisement for republicanism."
"The Citadel is a must see if you visit Hue or Danang areas. There is a lot of history at the Citadel which you should experience. Overall, Recommended. We had a tour guide for a complete day tour of tombs and Citadel."
Make sure you have a private guide. Just made so much easier to enjoy the tour. Much larger then the Forbidden City in Beijing. Home was the name of our tour guide. Thank you.
"I found the Imperial Citadel to be a fascinating place. The problem however is that is sustained significant damage during the Tet Offensive of the Vietnam war and a lot of it is ruins, or disappeared completely, such as the Purple Palace for example. And if you explore without a guide you are in danger of missing a lot of the history and the story behind and the use of the buildings, especially those that are no longer there."
"It is a very old administrative area of Vietnam and currently it only has a few remaining architectural buildings, which are quite beautiful but not being repaired and repaired, there are many walls that are about to collapse. with moss and ancient moss, yes, they look quite interesting."
"This place, what remains, is vast, grand and really gives a flavour of what life in the imperial court must have been like.
Highly recommend to spend a few hours to look about and get a glimpse of a time gone by."
Hue Citadel & Imperial Enclosure is a beautiful World Heritage Site and is perfect for a day of exploration at a leisurely pace.
"There are generally 2 schools of thought for ancient ruins like this one: do some restoration to make it more aesthetically appealing or leave it as it is to preserve authenticity. This one’s more of the latter. There is minimal restoration (some seems to be in progress) and you can be sure to expect to see many areas where all you see is rubble, with only your audio guide to explain what used to be there but destroyed by the war."
Beautiful place. We even saw humming birds fleeting through the flowers! Prepare to spend about 3hrs here.
"Went for a walk around and paid 150,000 each to get in (they do combo deals if you plan to go to the tombs as well).

On the map it looks simple to be able to walk up and down from one building to the next however there was so much work going on things weren’t open we ended up missing things as it wasn’t clear which way to go and a lot of the buildings look the same. I suspect if you got an audio guide (or went with an actual guide) you may get more out of it than we did walking around."
Most times if you go to an attraction it’s full of people - but here you can find peace and tranquility. It’s massive and a work in progress as it’s restored. Amazed by the low key casualness of it and how every corner reveals something new. A true gem and I hope it stays the same as it is about peace and peaceful times of a country with a long history of war. So sad to see the destruction of such a beautiful place from more recent wars.
"Run down and pretty much needs better looking after. 150,000 vnd per person really needs to be better spent on improvements."
"Paid the entry fee then proceeded to enter the City. Large area to cover including Throne room, temple, displays of old pictures. Great way to spend an afternoon. Needs some extra TLC but worth spending time and money at. Audio guides are available."
I would imagine that this is the main tourist attraction in Hue. It’s a big complex with many separate buildings. Built around 1825-1840 they are ornate palaces built for the royal family. There is not very much inside and there have been lots of repairs but it’s well worth a visit if you’re in Hue.
"This old citadel was once the capital of Vietnam. In the war a very big part was destroyed, but nowadays they are rebuilding and restoring parts of the site. You can wander around for hours and admire the gardens and ponds."
"A must see sight when in Hue, on its own sufficient to justify visiting the city.
It took us over 3 hours to get round it all, & that was with guidance from someone who had been before.
It was well worth the time to see the amazing buildings & learn about the history of the kings.
Buy a ticket that gets you into 3 of the tombs as well, as long as you've time to spend most of a another day going round them. Our hotel booked us a car & driver to do that, at very reasonable cost."
"We arrived at the same time as the tour groups so escaped to the gardens which we were able to enjoy in peace.
There are small heron? in the trees on the islands and some amazing bonsai trees.
Some of the buildings are showing their age but that is part of the attraction. Others have been renovated several times.
Signage is poor and as we were walking to the exit realised we’d missed some parts. Spent 4 hours there in total.
Some buildings require ladies to cover their knees and shoulders and have gowns to borrow."
A definite must. There is so much history to be learnt from visiting this attraction. You will see bullet holes in the wall from the American war and the destruction that took place in some areas.
"We enjoyed learning about the history of the ancient city, the restoration and the art. We enjoyed the orchids and the garedens and also the shop and the artists who worked in their art. We did not use a guided tour and I would recommend anyone who wants to learn more to use one."
I toured the grounds here during a recent visit to Hue. This home of the Emperors for several centuries is impressive and played an important part in the history of Hue and Vietnam. The quarters are in various states of repair but parts of the grounds are really beautiful. Some areas suffered destruction during the Vietnam War but there is plenty to see and its a great place to learn some of the history as well.
Very beautiful but very big so at the end of the tour you have seen so much you don't appreciate it any more
We had a guided tour of the citadel it’s definitely worth a visit . Also we took a rickshaw tour around so they could show us around the city walls.
"We really loved our visit here, definitely up with one of the best visits we have made in Hue. Allow a full day for your visit. The Citadel and Royal Palace especially are amazing. Steeped in history. Amazing architecture, rich reds & gold. Beautiful hanging orchid gardens, lakes full of Koi carp which you can feed food pellets. A couple of cafes for refreshments. Lovely gardens. Don’t forget the VR (Virtual Reality) experience (separate building) on your way out!! Amazing 😉"
"So much history walking through the citadel you get lost, my favorite attraction in Hue by far!!
The ancient ruins really tell the story of the dynasty, and the architecture is breathtaking."
Great experience only wish we would have stayed an extra day to read everything. I would recommend going with a guide who explain the intricacies.
We visited the citadel in Hanoi but the one in Hue is so much more impressive and its history is so much more interesting
"I couldn't get into it. Maybe a hot humid day, but I tried. There were some interesting things to see, and I love the history of temples etc. but overall, it was underwhelming."
"Huge place to walk around, very nice buildings and lot of history. Located in n the center of Hue, totally worth the visit."
"Nice trip in Hue with Citadel, Minh Mang tomb, Khai Dinh tomb and one day to Laguna Tam Guang and Thanh Toan bridge."
"I had a short visit to Hue and went to the Imperial City. I've been to the Forbidden City in Beijing and in comparison this is smaller and simpler but still elegant. It's a large site - the layout is based on a series of courtyards that lead from public to the private areas. Not a lot of furniture or interior decoration remains - it is mostly empty. Even so, this is a must-see location if you are visiting Hue, and will also give you insight into the long imperial history of Vietnam, which I really didn't know much about before this trip."
"36 hectares of palaces! Consider 3 to 4 hours for the visit. If you with a local tourist guide is definitely better,"
Imperial City is very impressive. Surrounded with water and many beautiful buildings in a very huge garden.
"A bit to expensive for just a walk inside the Citadel, the audio guide should be included in the price of the entrance"
So much history. So vast. So interesting. The gardens are also beautiful. A photographer’s dream. The reconstruction efforts are amazing.
We have very good journey in the citadel. The monument is nice and typically. The ticket is 7$ by people.
"Must visit. We had a guide but a good guide book would be fine. Take Lots of photos. We also saw the boy monk apprentices who were mor3 than happy to be photographed.
Also cycled within the outer citadel and are at La Carambole- Frenchified Vietnamese food- nice."
It may have been an umbrella and waterproof day but the Citadel was still beautiful. I especially liked the old Library and Gardens. Such a pity it was destroyed by bombing but now much has been lovingly restored to its former glory.
We did a half day walking trip with bike taxi ride and lunch. Lot to see and fascinating buildings and history. You could spend up to a day around here. The market next to Imperial city is also fascinating.
This was a very interesting and significant Citadel. We were fortunate to have a guide and that made all the difference. It’s a shame so much of it was destroyed in the worthless war. Definitely an impressive place to visit.
"Enjoyed the visit to the imperial city of Hue a lot.
The complex is huge! Take enough time to explore. I took the audioguide and it was really helpful, otherwise I would not have understood what this is all about. It's definitely worth the extra money.
Depending on how much time you have, you can choose a route to follow. On this route, you can also choose to just go for the highlights, if you're not that into history but would like to know the essence of it all.
We arrived late in the afternoon and only had 1-2 hours and we concentrated on the highlights which was perfect.
There are a lot of amazing things to see, the palaces and for example the stunning, all red and golden theater."
"If you are visiting Hue you shouldn’t skip the Imperial City, which is one of the most important landmarks in town."
"This was such a fun place to visit. The tickets to enter the grounds are only 150.000 VND (around $6) and there is so much to see. We lost track of time exploring all the different buildings. It’s a lot of walking so make sure you have comfortable shoes and lots of water. Also, be sure to bring your camera/phone for photos!"
"Home of kings, steeped in history and probably unequalled in its day. Ravaged by wars it is now a partially restored UNESCO site. The sheer size - once housed a city - is difficult to comprehend and we were informed it would take another 6 years to be completely restored...??? Magnificent work done to date it’s well worth a visit. Set aside at least a couple of hours. It’s also a very busy site."
Probably the only historic site worth a long visit. Plenty to see once you get inside the palace complex. You can walk around inside the citadel for free but you must pay to go inside the palace complex but it is well worth several hours of your time
"We had a great time at the Citadel. Took a taxi to the main gate and reached at 8am where we saw the opening ceremony. There was hardly any tourists and we spent about an hour and 15 mins exploring the place.
- I would RECOMMEND making a rough plan before you start seeing everything because the place is huge and if you only have an hour or two, it’s best to know where you want to go. The middle stretch is where the main structures are.
-HOWEVER, we did not make a plan and “went with the flow..” and we still discovered some amazing sights.

The place is very well preserved with a rich history. The architecture is astounding. The palace activities were grand and intricate, jt seems and hence the grandeur and detail is represented in all aspects on the grounds."
"We had a decent day walking through the ground of Citadel, pick a cloudy day to explore the place, you may need at least half a day to see everything."
Interesting place with a lot of history from 17th century and onwards. Small cafes and shops inside as well as western style WC in acceptable conditions.
"We visited the Imperial Citadel in Hanoi and was curious how this would compare. This was where the royals lived and it was a much bigger complex. Unfortunately, many of the buildings were destroyed by the wars here, but there was still lots to see."
"I’ve read reviews that said that the places needed a renovation and that things are falling apart. I’m not sure why anyone would post something like that. Clearly they do not understand the history of Vietnam or Hue. The majority of the buildings were either damaged or destroyed bar the many wars in the country. They are painstakingly restoring and returning things to their former glory. While you can book a tour, Steven and I did this one on our own and roamed all the grounds and buildings (the tours don’t take you to see all of them). Do this one on a rainy or cloudy day. It’s full sun for the most part so the cloud coverage saved us from the heat. We walked over from the city to the citadel. You can take a taxi or motorcycle but if you feel like walking do it.
It’s the must see thing in Hue."
"If you want to avoid tourist traps we recommend this tour. Citadel, pagoda and the main thombs. Our driver Vu was very professional and polite."
Nothing special about this place. Lets say its a nice walk around town. Thats preety much it. But thats just my opinion.
"Wow must see in Hue with guide or audio guide city was destroyed during the war
But restaurded partialy."
"Bit expensive to visit and there are a lot of seller around to take you on bike rides. Very touristy, you won't find any locals here. If you're into it you maybe like it but a lot of the original buildings are gone and there are a lot of recently made little buildings."
Great experience I didn’t realize how rich Vietnam history was prior to French colonization. It is large complex and if you look closely you will see bullet holes
"When you're in Hue, you should miss out on the imperial city and citadel. The entry of 150,000 VND per person is absolutely worth it, no matter what the weather is like. The complex of buildings and gardens is huge, you can spend hours here, walking through the different buildings and temples and admiring the nice gardens. We didn't take a guided tour and think going here and exploring everything by yourself is the best."
It was drizzling when we arrived Hue two weeks ago. However this doesn't stop us to go around Hue. The view of Citadel was fantastic & nice. Calm & beautiful scenery around the lake in Citadel. Must see in Hue.
"Me and my partner spent 6 hours in the Citadel and we still probably didn’t finish everything. It’s so big and you have the option to do the whole day or half it’s totally up to you how much you’d like to do. I couldn’t get over how amazing the Citadel was, it was filled with information and we learnt so much about the Vietnamese history. I’d totally recommend."
"It was raining the day we visited, but it still was a fantastic place to visit..it was an easy walk from our hotel.."
"A must see in Hue. Unfortunately much of the citadel was destroyed in 20th century, so everything's either restored (fortunately with taste) or lay in ruins."
So much to see!! Beautiful buildings and artifacts. Enjoyed the audio guide. Needed the whole day to do it justice. The grounds are enormous. A must see
"Must see ...
Very beautiful ..
Wear comfortable shoes as you ll have to walk quite a bit and open shoes at temple if you want to go inside it"
"Wooden citadel dated back to Vietnam Nguyen dynasty. If you like history, this is the place for you. It's wasted as few of the structures are no longer exist due to war. If you have been in China Forbidden city, it looks similar but in miniature size and less complete in structure. Prefer visit on sunny day."
"Interesting tour around the old palace
Good to learn about the kings before the French influences
Some amazing architecture
Not really for kids"
"This has a lot of potential but it’s not there yet!
I could use a ton of restoration and cleaning, the majority of the buildings is full of moss, and painting coming out.

I got the audio guide but was a total waste for me. If you like something very factual, not funny, and with the architecture details of how many meters height, then you should get it 😊

Take a morning or an afternoon for the place. It was raining today, so I didn’t suffer with the heat, but the pictures were not so great.

It’s a must see! Needs a lot of improvements!
Take cloths proper for temples"
"Honestly i didn't do any deep research before i when to Hue, but i have heard many news from friends and family about the Imperial City - the ancient places where the last Kings of Vietnam stay.

Wonderful! Great architecture in an enormously large area make you can spend even a days just to walk through every area in this imperial city!. The most impressive things to me are the stories of hisstory i can read when i come through many ancient objects and rooms inside.

It made me love Hue more and all experiences here had exceeded my expectations!"
Good place for any ages to visit huge place to go around if you are an architect lover great for photo shoot.
"The imperial citadel gives an excellent journey into the past. Although the majority of the first buildings have been damaged during numerous wars, several important buildings have been reconstructed and renovated giving a great impression of previous times. Well curated exhibitions with old pictures further improve the knowledge? Reserve fifty percent one day because of this website."
"Best site by far in Vietnam thus far on our visit.

The site is huge and absolutely breathtaking.

Once you move away from the your groups who don't venture far inside, it's easy to be fairly alone.

Allow half a day at least.

A must do visit."
"Must visit if you want to know more of the ancient history of Vietnam. Get a good guide too.
Most structures are in their original state, and left me in awe! So much fine craftsmanship to build every column, chairs, plaques, statues etc etc.. Can only imagine how luxurious and grand life must be back then.
Sadly, a huge part of it was ruined during war, not sure if the government is going to resurrect that portion.
Still, whatever that’s left standing is still worth a visit, and worthy of a UNESCO heritage site."
"A huge historical site … well worth seeing … a lot written on trip advisor … so I thought I would give eight key tips on how to get the most from your visit

1- site is large and very exposed to the sun. So take sun screen…water…hat / clothes that give some protection
2- buy the right ticket. You can get one for the site only. Or one that also covers the pagodas which are out of town
3- audio guide. 100k Dong. It’s a little bit “dry” … very factual… rather than dramatic. But without doubt better than nothing as there is not a wealth of information inside
4- there are also walking tours on the internet… which are free … so you could wander around and read commentary on your phone
5- the map they give you when you buy the audio guide has three coloured routes on it… short / medium / all day…. So you can alter your route to the time available
6- stop rest and relax at one or two of the refreshment stops. It’s hard work… so take a break
7- Co Ha Garden and the palace areas immediately preceding … in my opinion are to most enjoyable. However it’s possible you will be wilting by the time you get there. It’s a beautiful formal garden with lovely bonsai/ general planting. Well worth allocating the time to enjoy it.
8- As you come onsite the first building contains the emperors throne..... in the room behind on the left is a film that shows a digital reconstruction of how the site would have looked when fully built. This is worth watching.

Have fun. If you found this useful please give it a useful vote. Many thanks."
"If you happen to be in Hue and looking for something to do the I recommend a visit to the Imperial City. As far as 'must do' goes, depends what you have seen previously and what other attractions you plan to see whilst in Hue.

I do think it is worthwhile visiting if you have time to kill and it is a place that you can almost get yourself 'lost in' as it covers quite a large area.

It will cost you 150K VND for an adult entry and an additional 100K VND for an audio headset.

As one traveller mentioned, best to go early as it does get quite hot and some areas of the site are quite exposed.

Plan to spend anywhere from 1 - 4 hours."
"This is such an impressive place! You can easily spend a half day there if want to have a good look and follow audio guide.
I would recommend to visit as early as possible as there is a lot of open space and not much shadow you can hide in."
There are several interesting buildings however the complex has suffered from bombing in the wars and iqs rather disappointing. You are much better going to the royal tombs which are intact. Restoration here is slow
"Impressive Palace and a lots of things to visit and get to know about the Nguyen! Lovely gardens, but could use a bit more informations, for visitors not using audio guides."
"Good for walking, wonderful architecture, many interesting things about the dynasty. Should wear a proper clothing since there are many temples inside(though they have sarang to wear), pls read about the history before exploring by yourself if not with a tour guide would be much better"
"The palace and grounds were exceptional, so well looked after. The art, photography and artefacts were amazing, The gardens were very beautiful. We spent over three hours there but the heat beat us in the end, despite the rain! Well worth a visit."
"Badly damaged during the Tet offensive with ongoing restoration, mostly since the site was recognized by UNESCO."
"Damaged during the war by American bombing this historic citadel is gradually being rebuilt to its original splendour

Very reminiscent of similar buildings in China it is clear to see Vietnam’s fantastic history

A MUST see but get there early before the crowds"
"Nice city to visit, lots of history and monuments, temple to visit.
Be aware of the taxis!
we visited 9 cities in Vietnam without issue but every day in Hue we had an issue. (3 issues in 1.5days)
Make sure you confirm your destination with the driver as he will offer to take you to a nicer place, of course far away of your original plan and to come back it will be an issue, so the taxi will again offer to wait for you and charge you more.
Entering and exiting the taxi :
These guys are crasy, 1st my wife was half way exiting the car and the guy drive away, she almost fall down.
Next it was me, the guy start to leave when I was entering the car, almost he hurt me....

The city is beautiful otherwise the citadel is huge, plan 3-4h if you want to visit it entirely.
Nice restaurants too"
"It's the place you can't miss in Hue, Vietnam. You can feel the reality of existing Kingdom. The design of each building is so unique. If you love history and architectures, you may have to take the whole day for sightseeing."
"A place not to miss, rain or shine. I strongly recommend a stroll through the back gardens and taking the time to learn about this beautiful place"
"The Hue imperial city is accessible by foot, grab bike or taxi. There is much walking around and do expect to spend at least 2 to 3 hours exploring the different parts of the palaces. Much of the palace were heavily damaged from the war and restored to its best. There are many pictures of the emperors decree from the Nguyen dynasty. Visit temples, royal guest residence, emperor hallway, long terrace, royal gardens, theatre. Visit their craft store or try your hand to make a craft. The single ticket cost VND 150000 or buy a combination ticket package to see the royal tombs that comes with some discount."
"Well worth a visit. War and negligence has destroyed most of the buildings. However if you find a quiet spot, close yourceyes ,it is possible to time travel to what must have been a magnificent complex. Really glad we spent a couple of hours on our own just wandering this special place."
"Fairly expensive to get in but there was loads of things to see, was so much bigger than we expected."
"I came to Hue, especially to visit the Imperial citadel. It was nearby my hotel, the taxi dropped us near the ticket counter, the entry tickets cost us 150k VND/person. The place is huge, beautiful and really seemed like it housed royals in ancient era. Beautiful gardens, flowers, old architecture, different buildings. The magnificent red colour, so photogenic. Thankfully it had electric cars for movement, otherwise my elderly mother would've had a very tough time, cost us total 300k VND. The main entrance hall had a digital movie explaining the citadel and its construction, which was very informative. It also has a small cafe inside. It is very huge to explore on your own, own foot."
"I wish I could give a better review but shattered by the heat I had to take refuge in a coffee bar. However what little I did see fully justifies not just 5 stars but its UN Heritage status. Firstly the well preserved city walls are reminiscent of those in Mandalay or Chiang Mai, but more complete and better maintained. The fortresses guarding the entrances to the citadel are awe-inspiring - daring any invader to think twice. Outside one of the city gates we were mercilessly harassed by trishaw drivers and the nearby ladies selling lanterns and hats made determined, but finally unsuccessful, efforts to confuse us between the similarly coloured 50,000 and 500,000 dong notes."
This is a must-see. It is magnificent in every way. Allow yourself enough time to walk all around and take in the details. There are music performances for an extra fee if you timing is right. The gardens are exquisite
Imperial City is very pretty and has lots of information boards and facilities around. I got the audio guide which was really informative.
We didn't expect the citadel to be that great and were surprised by its beauty. Although some sites are still under renovation the restoration efforts are immense and we spent the whole day there without being able to cover everything. Highly recommend the audio guides for more insights.
"We wandered around for a few hours and enjoyed the peacefulness of this great citidel, some interesting architecture and photos of years gone by. Very enjoyable."
"An amazing place, such a shame that so much has been destroyed by wars. The reconstruction made is impressive. You need good shoes because you have to walk a fair bit. The gardens are fabulous with many impressive bonsais. A must to visit preferably with a guide"
"This place is very interesting and certainly worth taking time out of your day to see it. This is Vietnam remember so the urgency to repair and restore things isn’t on the agenda like Europe. Still with that said,what is there is very interesting and the 3D interactive ride is certainly worth doing to show you what it all looked like in the past. We didn’t do a tour and we didn’t follow a route but we saw everything."
"Absolutely incredible sprawling citadel with many different areas to get lost in, really amazing. Beautiful art and craftsmanship and intricate telling of Hue’s story as the Imperial seat of Vietnam. Expect to spend at least a half day taking it all in. Definitely not to be missed!"
Extremely interesting. What a shame though that so much of Vietnams history was destroyed in not one but two conflicts. Restoring and rebuilding will take a lot of effort and time.
Whenever I look at these magnificent structures I am in awe as to how they were constructed in a time when tools of trade must have been basic. One wonders as to the monumental task of hauling the blocks of stone to create such magnificent buildings.
Loved our visit to Hue. The citadel and history were very interesting. We wandered for a couple of hours and despite the tour busses we were often alone. A must see
Fascinating citadel steeped in history . You can’t go to Hue and not visit . We had an excellent guide which helps with orientation and history . Would advise doing an organised tour to give you a better insight into the vast citadel .
"We saw way beautiful attractions in Vietnam than this o e (150000 vnd entrance fee), poor toilets, not many things to see, more photos o. The wall than actual buildings or objects"
"A very beautiful city full of history.If you want to visit the Imperial City you must know that it was rebuild almost all after the war, so you will find only some parts that are from the original construction.
The gardens are lovely."
I had gret time in hue lovely to see the feudle thing with citatel... its very good for teenagers learn about the history from this. Side by side with truong tien brigde its nice
Great history to be learnt in the Imperial city and such an enlightening place to visit. I would recommend a visit to this place if you are in Hue.
Not spectacular but a good guide would be helpful to enjoy it. Otherwise you’d not appreciate the visit
"This is a UNESCO world heritage site located on the banks of the Perfume River. This is large area and consisting of palaces, temples and theater.In the centre is the forbidden purple city but nothing remains of this portion of Citadel. The places to see in the Citadel are Thai Ho Palace, The Hall of Mandarins, the stunning but partially ruined Dien Tho Residence, To Mieu Complex, Thai Binh Pavilion and Royal Theatre. The area of Citadel is vast and it needs at least half a day to see the place. To enjoy this historical site a local guide is a must.
Open time: 7.00 am to 17.30 pm daily.
Ticket: 150.000 VND for the adults and 30.000 VND for the children."
Visiting the citadel was a great learning experience! We watched a lot of YouTube videos before visiting to make sure we understand the most out of it. There is also audio available that will explain to you the history and meaning about it. We spent about 4-5 hours because we read a lot and watched all the videos that were available to get the most out of it. So make sure you plan accordingly!
"A lovely place to visit and learn lots. Well worth a trip, leave a good couple of hours at least to wander around and explore, it's also fun to feed the fish :)"
Great place to visit a must in Hue. Stunning wear comfortable shoes if your planning to explore the complete palace
You can visit independently but we went as part of a group tour through Deluxe Group Tours and it was great haviing a tour guide to give us so much more information. It is huge and a big place to get around but a must see in Hue.There are english captions . To be recommended.
This was a nice experience. A word to the wise take full advantage of the tuk tuk drivers. They can get you around much quicker and safer in the sun and it just makes the whole experience much better. The little museum with emperor clothes was an added Cooling off bonus.
"Ah, what once was! Although a shadow of its former glory, you can still get a feel for the Imperial age of Vietnam walking through the restored corridors of the Citadel. Unfortunately the Americans bombed it heavily during the war, leaving vast areas inside the walls just open fields today. There is restoration work on-going, and what remains--and has been restored--is quite impressive. There are lots of photos on the walls of the Imperial court, and narratives to give a sense of how life was back in the day. Don't miss the Forbidden Purple City, which has been almost fully restored and in addition to the living quarters of the Emperors and their concubines features some terrific gardens. I look forward to returning some day when they have significantly more of the old buildings restored and seeing it then."
"Though portion of the Citadel were closed for renovations when I visited, the comp lex is definitely representative of the imperial period."
"If you go to Hue, please make sure to visit the citadel. A great way to discover this ancient place is by a tour, however audioguides are also available. Really impressing."
"We heard all about the Royal families from many years past, able to view where they lived and how they lived. Wonderful things to view."
We enjoyed a half day tour with “Tom” of Vietnam Timeless Charm Tours. Lots of history and fun along the way.
Great tourist attraction with lots to see about the life and times of the ruling class. Well worth going there.
"This massive palace is well worth a visit. Take it slow. Vietnam seems to be always
hot or wet. It is amazing to see this compound with some of the buildings well maintained. Yes, there are more impressive citadels or palaces in Southeast Asia but the charm of Hue can't be missed. There are of course areas that are not well preserved, so use your imagination. Challenging for some to get around. There is extensive walking and not recommended with people with limited mobility."
"A trip to Hue is incomplete without a visit to the legendary Imperial City. It’s a massive compound (of mostly overgrown grasses) but there are numerous original walls and restored structures around the UNESCO named World Heritage Site.

Entrance fee is tad steep compared to the rest of attractions in and around Vietnam (150k), but I want to believe that it’s going towards the restoration costs. I heard rumours of the ticket people pulling a fast one on tourists, so I used 400k in 200k increments for the two of us. This way, I can make sure that they give us back an 100k bill.

As for the City itself, I found it pretty monumental. Architecture and layout is without a doubt influenced by the Chinese, but it’s a fascinating part of Vietnamese history. It was sweltering the day we went to the place, so the halls with doors let in some nice, welcoming breeze. I found the doors to be the most delightful things at the City. Every opened door had a different scenery of a past: restored pavilions, wall ruins, unkempt grassy knolls, moped trails and litter. And breezes. Oh, the wonderful breezes.

There are photographs and galleries around that showcase part of its history as well as your typical tourist souvenir shops that sell generic condo-living paintings that may dilute the overall experience. The kitsch and corny experience of dressing up as imperial nobles to sit on the throne is way out of our league, but it could be fun for families to get a laugh or two.

And the downer: the complex is slightly unkempt and it’s not accessible, in any meaning of the word. Wheelchair users may want to hire a couple extra hands to help out with the stairs.

But hey! At least the washrooms are accessible! They’re loaded with bars on the toilet and the urinal and is even marked with the blue handicap symbol above the urinal to tell you they mean Bee’s Knees. Just prepare to stand up and walk up and down a few flights of stairs to reach the ramp to the toilet. You know, climbing stairs, the thing people with mobility issues can so easily do.

And if that wasn’t enough spit in your face, the new VR experience pavilion isn’t even equipped with a ramp.

At the Imperial City, you’d better prepare a poncho, ‘cause it’s like a monsoon of spit raining down on you the moment you step in with a wheelchair.

For non-wheelchair users, it’s a nice tranquil place built upon shoulders of wars. You can easily lose hours meandering the courtyards and pavilions, as well as the complex around the main City."
"I read a review earlier about seeing this place. They were absolutely correct, a lot of history. You will need someone to translate. If you are like me and dont speak Vietnamese.Take water if you decide to do this in the heat like I did. I didnt make it through the whole site, it is huge. But the main highlight was the building that had the former kings, very interesting."
We spent a good 3 hours exploring this massive citadel. It has lots of history and some well maintained buildings and gardens. Be prepared for long walks from one end to the other.
"With 10km of citadel wall and a lot of visitors, looking hot and bothered, we decided to take in the Citadel by walking to the centre and watch the world go by, while sitting under a cool tree. Wittnessed a couple if cannon firings. Would apear they happen on the 1/2 hour. Impressive structure"
"We went the imperial city around 1030am on a Saturday. It was not very busy and easy to walk around and not be crowded. It was very humid so we didn’t waste a lot of time. The price was 150k dong per adult. You can also purchase packages at the ticket booth for the tombs as well and save a bit of money. We were offered a taxi ride to the marina and then a boat ride to a pagoda / monastery and than dropped at the imperial city arranged by our hotel for $20 US. It was ok, you can take a taxi directly to these sites for a bit cheaper. The grounds inside the walls are full of interesting history of royal families. Many of the structures have been restored fairly recently some up into the late 1990’s. much of the complex was destroyed during the war. Nice garden areas and some great spots for pictures. I’ve read many posts about spending the entire day there ....... I don’t know about that. We walked around for about 2 hours and that more than covers the complex."
"The place has such amazing history and is perfect for those interested, This was a must see, you could spend all day walking around i think if you are in HUe this is a must see!"
"The imperial citadel is actually within a larger citadel. While a lot of the buildings were destroyed those standing have been lovingly restored and are breathtaking.
My hotel and various guidebooks said an hour is sufficient but I spent 4 and wish I had had a bit longer to see the remaining buildings.
I used the audio guide, following their recommend route for half a day and found that ideal as i could go at my own pace and the information on the audio guide was good. Alternatively you can hire a local guide at the entrance (no idea of the quality).
There are several places to stop for a drink and rest (you’ll need it - it’s hot and a lot of walking) within the complex but no proper restaurants.
I had read that it can be very full but I was pleasantly surprised. Several groups entered when I did around 9am but once I had left the first area they all seemed to vanish and at times I was all alone."
I didn’t appreciate how huge this was before I visited. It goes on *forever*. Be prepared. But the various Asian styles of gardens and architecture are fascinating and the grounds are beautiful. Don’t be afraid to visit in the rain bc there are plenty of shelters to wait under while passing storms go by.
"Extras around the Citadel

The Tu Phuong Vo Su Pavilion used to be a recreational building for the Royal family; it's now a coffee house.

The Luc Bo Cultural Space used to be the working headquarters of the mandarins; it's now a tourist center where you can learn about traditional crafts among other things.

The Hue Museum of Royal Antiquitiies used to be the working space of King Thieu Tri .
Nearby was the Imperial Academy.

Basically, the whole area around the Nguyen Van Troi Park is great to explore; you may discover several relics from the old days - some are in near-decayed state."
"Beautiful place with a mysterious atmosphere!
Territory is quite big but still you can walk around it in a 2-3 hours;)best spot in Hue city , definitely worth to see if you are in Hue ! tickets for adults is 150.000 VND"
"On our recent tour of Vietnam, Hue was just one of the many cities we stayed in and explored. The Citadel is a real piece of both accident and modern history. The entrance is very impressive with its large cannons and huge walls. Once in side the great outer walls its tranquil and very calming with large shaded walk ways and mini water ponds which look very nice. One piece of advice I think is to try and go on a guided tour to explain more of the history."
"Same layout as the Forbidden City in Beijing, just a bit in disrepair, but they’re working on it. Some parts already beautifully restored, the throne room is splendid. Lots of walking and it can get quite hot. But definitely worth the small entry fee of appr. Aud $10."
"You can tell that this location is the pride of Hue. Filled with history and intricacy, this place is perfect for someone who’s a history junky like myself. Make sure you get a good tour guide — it amplifies the experience. Must visit!"
"Imperial city of Hue is an old ancient city with temples of the Vietnam dynasties ,pagodas and tombs surrounding with mountains.
It is worth to visit the imperial city."
"Lovely day out so put aside 3-4 hours to fully explore all it has. Gorgeous gardens, temples, bonsai trees. For the temple areas you can't go in with shorts and will need to cover your shoulders. Good day out. If it's hot, take a parasol as you will need it and loads of water"
"Great place, very large, could use push bike hire to get around, it is a lot to see in one day.
A must to do in Hue. A lot of walking required."
"Visited in Sept, so carry umbrella. Hot, and either wet or sunny. Lots of walking as it covers a huge area,, but amazibg history and buildings in very good shape. We did not have a guide or audio, so a map of the area and description would have been good, especially for cost of entrance fee, 350vnd ea. Min 2 hr visit, lots of great photos."
"A vast area with 3 layers of fortresses so abit of walking was required just to reach the entrance and inside as well. The guide we had gave a good historical background of the place. Luckily, there were some benches to rest our tired legs. There were framed pictures with English explanations plus a model of the whole area so it was self explanatory. It was a pity that some parts of it were bombed by the Us during the Vietnam war. Its now a unesco heritage site. Since it was a hot day a hat and drinking water came in useful. You can buy drinks at a stall near the queen's residence. Quite an amount of time was required to visit and read the explanation."
The Citadel is very big and there is much to explore. We found it very interesting although some areas could be better maintained especially as this is such an important historical site.
"You do not have to take an expensive tour, with a guide & air con bus from your hotel if you're feeling a bit more adventurous. We walked from town & got 2 grab bikes to get us home again, but I highly recommend getting to the Citadel early. If I did it again I would take grab bikes both ways, & we are in our 60s, what a hoot. It's hot, humid & you will be doing a lot of walking. Take an umbrella for a break from the sun, or rain, whichever you cop.Take water too.
The tuk tuk drivers cannot enter the citadel, they are hawking to sell you a ride around the outer wall.
Once in there either choose an audio guide, or go it alone, I took a photo of the big map which helped us get around.
It was an amazing wander through history. We saw it in the dry, it would be amazing to see all the pools & moats full of water. There were artisans who are plying their trade near the west gate & a really good gift shop in the middle where you can pay to dress up as the Emperor & get your photo taken either on his throne or in his palanquin.
Well worth half a day or more."
We loved exploring the Citadel at our own leasure We went on our own buying tickets at the entrance and paying extra for the headphones. This was adequate and was nise to explore at our own pace. There was a very nice cafe in the middle to sit at and have a break ( pictured). Would recommend going to the city.
"The beautiful Imperial Palace (The Citadel) is a must see when visiting Hue. You will learn a lot about the Emperors lives, as this was at the time a city similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing. But you will also see traces from the more recent history since it was attacked during the Vietnamese war. Try to be there early to avoid the heat and enjoy the beautiful gardens."
"In this place you can see how was the old Vietnam , very interesting but a little bit long, I recommend having half the day to do it."
"Just walk through the majestic gate of the Imperial City, it seems like you take a trip back to 300 years ago. Though most of it now lies in ruins, you can still make out the magnificient palace, or the proud jewel of Imperial Vietnam a long time ago. Most of the renovation works are very well done, keeping the city and its best architecture in tact. The palace lake and imperial garden are so serene and beautiful... A must-go place to visit if you're in Hue."
"Great history for both the past and the recent past with the Vietnam war. Would recommend a guide to allow for a full understanding,"
"Love everything about this place, the architecture and landscape while appreciating the history of not so ancient imperial Viet dynasty which lasted roughly 150 years. Try spending at least 2.5 days here to get the maximum of your stay in Hue."
"Very impressive place to visit and the overall size of this citidel is amazing, also some very impressive topiary and bonsai can be seen."
Spend a day in this enchanting place. A must when in Hue. Go early in the morning to avoid the heat. Fascinating history.
"A pretty majestic place in the old capital Hue. A moderate walk of out the hustle and bustle of central hue but well worth it. The citadel is the royal palaces and there are also three tombs which make up the other parts of the imperial attractions. There is a combo package for tickets to all of them which we’d recommend as if saves time at ticket gates and some $ when visiting them all.

It was amazing to see the history and the Chinese role and influence in Vietnam’s past. Elaborate gates, temples and buildings make up the citadel and a large number of descriptions and infographics exist. Each building or gate is quite similar but also very distinctive in their own detailing. Sad to see the number of them that are destroyed or dilapidated but it appears the government is currently focusing on revamping. Surrounded by a mote full of lake plants, you really do feel taken back in time.

The whole citadel is quite large - I think we clocked up about 10km walking to and around it. That said, you could bus or drive to it and there were airport style buggies driving people around in the citadel. The walk was worth it for us, despite the strong heat of the late morning. Suggest taking lots of water and comfortable shoes and we did see people using umbrellas to hide from the sun. Though the typical temple dress code applies, the guards seemed quite relaxed and I was wearing shorts and didn’t have an issue. The main thing seems to be no bare shoulders.

There’s a great local coffee shop nearby called Thien Truc Cafe which was a great place to stop by before or after visiting."
"We visited the Imperial City and we were impressed. As this was in November, the weather was not uncomfortably warm and we enjoyed the stroll in the City. A must visit when in Vietnam."
"What an amazing place, it was very hot and humid so take water. Lots of walking involved but well worth it"
when we visit there was hot & humid. place is the best to see but require much walking.good to see in winter
Lovely place but some bathrooms are very dirty and at the ticket office they were holding up a lot of rest.
Great place to visit despite the heat! Try to go after 3pm to avoid the high temperatures but keep a minimum of 2h to visit before closing time;
"The imperial city is a must when traveling to Hue. The tour is well organized and commented by well retired history. Of course, do not expect to be alone, many tourists invade the place."
"A very informative tour, which brought to life some of the major sacrifices during the conflicts of 1945 - 1975. The temples were interesting and the Citadel most impressive."
Was interesting to see but was not too exciting and expensive to enter by Vietnamese standards. Bit of a walk from town too.
"The architecture is breathtaking as well as the size of the city. It feels like traveling back in time. Make sure to bring some sunscreen, water and a hat during sunny days since it takes hours to visit everything and can get quite exhausting."
In my opinion one of the highlights of our Vietnam trip. I recomend to visit with a guide. It takes a couple of hours to visit but it really pays. You will sweat like hell bit this is standard in this country.
We did the Imperial city as part of a tour and it definitely helped having a local guide to provide context and stories to what is a beautiful place. You can't visit Hue and not come here!
I went to this place with my husband and some friends expecting it to be a half an hour tour in front of “some Vietnamese ruins”. It ended up being a beautiful old imperial city full of history. I would recommend to expect at least two/three hours in order to visit it all!
It was really hot when we visited (around noon) so we couldn't spend too long walking around. We felt we didn't want to pay for an audio guide (100k for one) - we had the internet and there were quite a few signs with English information. And a good video with lots of history in the first palace building.
"So worth a visit if you are in Hue - extensive, beautiful and a real treat to walk around. Great informative video outlining what it would have been like in its day and what it will be like when the reconstruction is finished. Highly recommended."
"Very good place to discover part of Vietnam history, even if a fair amount has been destroyed or is being rebuilt / restored. I'd really suggest to go with a guide, otherwise you'd probably have difficulties to understand what was happening there."
"This was ruined a lot by boms, but good to have tour guide to bring this alive with many stories of Royal Family. Would be beautiful after they finish restoration."
"This place is really spectacular. It is over two centuries old and is about 10 kilometers in its perimeter with a moat surrounding it.. There's a pyramid structure with a flag on top that one can see from a distance and this resembles some type of old fortress. The citadel has several entrances and, once inside, the visitor can see how enormous it is. . This is an attraction that anyone visiting Hue should not miss."
The imperial city is a site you should not miss. If you are from the USA don’t get talked into spending time in 2 cities. This forbidden city is not to be missed. Lots of history and details.
"There wasn’t a whole lot to see here, but it was still an interesting experience. There isn’t a lot of shade/places to sit/air conditioning, so you might want to avoid this place in the heat of the day."
"Gives you a good overview of the history of the last royal dynasty of Vietnam.
Well-run site with good audio guide and map, so you can go alone. But if you want some more detail it's probably worth getting hold of one of the many guides hanging around at the entrance.
It's hot, very hot and unfortunately, given the size of the place, there's a lot of walking in the blazing sun."
"Booked a trip to this place with our hotel in Hoi An and they arranged a private english speaking guide to meet us there. A fantastic place to visit if you like history and culture.
Would definitely recommend this"
The site is huge and many of the buildings and gates are amazing to look at. Definitely worth a visit; just a shame the damage that was done during the war.
Nothing crazy interesting but probably worth doing in hue. I only had like 1 hour to do it all so was rushed
A must visit when travelling to Hue. Makes you think how beautiful was this city before the war. These lovely vestiges of Vietnam’s architecture are well preserved bearing in mind what happened there. There is also an electric car service which will drop you in the relevant places of the citadel. Worth visiting it.
"The site is very well kept. Pity that most of the buildings were destroyed by the wars. The entrance is astonishing with carved arches and all the temples have a holy vibe given by the incense and offers.

The only critic that I can do is the lack of sense of direction that make the visitors losing the route, that it could be good on the sense that you can discover new places but you risk to miss others.
Overall I loved it."
"This place is definitely worth visiting and I recommend walking further around to see more than just the first few buildings.

My only criticism of this place is the separate line for nationals (cheaper entry)....imagine trying that one in the UK."
"It was a scorching hot day when I visited so we didn’t spend a huge amount of time but I still had a lovely time in the Citadel. There was a really nice cafe in one of the gardens to sit down and have a drink to cool down and prices were really reasonable.
There is a shop and craft area which was lovely to spend time watching incense being made and people decorating kites and hats.
The architecture and gardens are absolutely stunning."
"What a beautiful place to visit! This Really exceeded all our expectations! Despite the heat our team got to see all the beautiful wonders of this place. Lots of history to discover and wonderful people to see on the way.
Bring plenty of water."
"We enjoyed exploring this amazing site, and learning the history. It is being renovated in many areas but the repairs they have done so far are very good, keeping it original. We enjoyed sitting in front of a fan to watch the information to cool down too! Remember to take your time to enjoy."
Beautiful place. Lot of history. Better to do it with a guide to understand all the history. A must in Hué.
"Do spare at least 2 hours to visit this citadel if you leave history. A nice introduction to the last dynasty in Vietnam, Nguyen."
"Great visit to the citadel etc, DIY, so much to see on the vast site, not all wrecked by the americans thank fully, allow several hours to enjoy!!"
"Visited the Hue Imperial City with my 80 years old mother in law and knowing that she can’t walk the location, we bought 4 electric car tickets . To start we were moved from one car to another because the guides were debating who should take the job.

Finally the guide took us, send us to a total of 2 locations and left us decide for ourselves on what we want or need to do.

My advise is don't pay unless you have the staff confirm what they are going to provide you.

We paid and bought nothing. Service attitude is poor and the tour experience is negative. What a waste of time and money."
"We went here as a part of 4 stop tour she honestly your really could have given it a miss. It is fairly fun down and not exciting st all. The entrance was the most exciting part. We were told we had 2hrs there, we were in one end and out the other in 20mims."
Great way to spend a few hours in Hue. Beautiful site to visit and wander around. Great history to learn of the country. Try to go when outside of heat of the day.
Take your time and enjoy. The whole complex is larger than what you expect. You need at least 2 hours to get a goid glance of what was once a great palace. A must see in Hue
We visited this with our own guide- fascinating to learn about the royal family and their reign through the years and interactions with the various rulers of Vietnam. Quite a bit still stands of the buildings which were attacked in the war and they are starting to rebuild and restore it. Well worth a visit !
"Went with 3 teenage boys one morning. We didn't take buy an audio guide although this would have been helpful. Buy 1L water bottles from stands before you go in. Fierce heat meant our boys struggled. Although it is being restored it is quite faded in parts. A must see, try and go on a cloudy day."
This was a highlight of Hue and. We really enjoyed the cultural experience our guide was so informative and helpful. It was an amazing place and worth while we would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Hue to learn about their culture and history
We enjoyed ourselves from the moment we arrived until we left 4 hrs. later. The displays were impressive and the gardens beautiful. We would highly recommend visiting this attraction.
Some are ruins . Worth seeing specially the stamps of kings. Also this are us huge. You need to wear comfortable shoes.
Citadel is really a magnificent forbidden city. The fee is 150.000 vnd. It is open from 8am till 5:30 am.Must visit!
"The citadel was one of my highlights from our trip around Vietnam. Although we ended up visiting on a very hot afternoon, the whole family enjoyed exploring the buildings and history associated with this amazing location. They offer electric car tours of the site which might be a good option but they had sold out when we got there."
We came early when there’re not too many tourists & of course not very hot. The Citadel opens its gates from 8 in the morning & it took us around 3 hours to walk around. There are several major spots but highly recommend the Long Corridor. Bring your own water bottles & hats when visiting the Citadel.
"Impressive remaining of the old city. Best is to take a guide, otherwise you don't know what you are looking at. Easily half-day activity as the surrounding are very broad."
A must see: impressive forbidden city used by generations of kings. Easily half a day attraction. We were there with our teenage children and a guide. Having a guide adds value; our teenage kids were impressed by the city as well.
I had a great time!! I just didn’t know what I was looking at. I got there close to closing and loved looking around. I was able to get some fantastic photos. Make sure you wear pants and not shorts or a skirt if you want to go inside some of the buildings. It was serene and beautiful. I’d love to go back.
"We visited in summer when Hue's weather was sunny and hot. The city is in various states of restoration, so some buildings are completely restored, others are screened off, and others are piles of rubble. The entrance and the exit are different - the entrance is the main gate, and the exit is the east gate. I recommend the combo ticket with the tombs - good for 2 days and saves some money.

Highly recommended for anyone visiting Hue!"
"Very cool and very interesting. The place has such amazing history and is perfect for those interested. Great place to take photos also, just be careful of some shops as they often try to charge you more than the stated price."
"The citadel is a huge site and definitely worth visiting if you are in Hue. There’s lots of temples, gates, pergolas, pavilions and gardens to wander through and about. We got there around 08:30 and it was already very busy however if you walk to the sides away from the central corridor it was quieter.

We bought a package ticket which covered 4 sites. The royal palaces, Tu Duc Tomb, Khan Dinh Tomb and Ming Mang tomb. It cost 360,000 (about £14). Definitely worth it as the tombs are much quieter and there were a lot less people there than at the citadel. You need transport to get to the other sites though, we had our own bikes so it was easy.

It took us about 5 hours to go to all 4 sites and get back to Hue, definitely worth leaving early to avoid the heat and the bus loads of people."
It's not about going into the Citadel and doing the official tour. It's about staying near the citadel and soaking in the magic particularly at night.
"One for the history buffs. Very impressive reconstruction of the old imperial city which was once even more impressive, before the ravages of time and wars took their toll. You find out so much about the history and religion of the imperial emperors over the generations and also have an insight in to why many of them did not live very long, and it wasn't down to war or betrayal. The education system and competition for exam achievement to become the next leader, was facinating and the checks and balances of the mandarins aimed to ensure the most effective child (or if none were any good, a chosen raplacement) would become the next dynastic ruler."
We went here today and loved it. We had a guide which I would suggest as there are a lot of things to take in that you wouldn’t find out on your own. Really big place and lots of walking. So interesting though - a real must in Hué.
"I’ll start with a tip, the entrance is not an exit. This is well worth a visit, took sone great photos, certainly a must when visiting Hue, we didn’t use a guide, although did read up on the history a bit. All in all well worth it, we started very early which I recommend as it was quite warm by 11.00."
"Huge, beautiful and fascinating historical site. Unfortunately the experience was marred for us by the extremely rude staff. We hired an electric buggy to drive us around the various buildings as we have young kids and it was 38 degrees Celsius (400,000 VND for 45 mins; not cheap after the entrance fee too) and the ‘guide’ couldn’t have been much more unpleasant if she tried. Jerky driving, didn’t look at us, didn’t speak to us except to say ‘get out, 10 minutes’ at each stop on her ‘tour’."
When in Hue you must visit here to learn the history of the area and Vietnam. If you are able to have a guide or use the audio tour you will be able to enjoy the experience more.
Really good visit. Hired audio guide and it was well worth it. Watch the time of day u visit in July. Avoid 12 noon - 14.45pm. We really enjoyed our visit.
"The Forbidden Imperial city and Citadel are two important landmarks of Hué. It was shocking to see how many of he structures were damaged or destroyed in the two wars. Only 30% were left standing! As in any historical landmark there are enough books and maps that you could tour it on your own BUT you should really get a guide. Our guide brought the place to life, and made it more relatable. A top tip: Don’t go on a tour there if the temperatures are over 40c. There is very little air movement, you will not enjoy it. We went when it was 35c and it was marginal."
"So it’s not that old anyway but nothing was real. It had all been “restored” but it looked like a poor restoration job if you ask me, looked like a Crappy film set from the 70’s.

All the “museums” just have replica items in. We didn’t find one genuine article. But by far the worst bit is the most ornately decorated room being used for tourists to dress up and have their photo taken on a replica throne. It was cringeworthy.

The best bit was feeding the fish. But don’t feed the fish at the entrance, walk further in the complex and there is some more in a quieter setting."
"This is much bigger than expected. In July my friend and the guide almost melted in the heat. Possibly better to have the time to walk at your leisure and take in the site than to have a guide, as the information was fairly repetitive and as we were also following him, we weren't able to work out the route we were going in. I would have liked to see some before, and after photos of the damage done by the Americans to this site, but non were available to look at at the time I was there."
"We went today, and it was very hot with a lot of walking, but it was interesting and lovely, and the kids liked it better than most places we’ve taken them sightseeing. My only real complaint was that the water and ice cream stand that our guide took us to sold us one small bottle of water for 100,000.00! There were no posted prices, and our guide did not warn us. I saw the shop owner later give the guide a free drink, and I felt like we had been set up. The children were desperate for a drink, otherwise I would’ve put the bottle back. In other stores in the citadel, including one near the library, prices were posted and the same bottle of water was selling for 15,000, and just outside a woman was selling two bottles for one dollar.
So, be careful of the ice cream and water stand that is just past the temple and the wc (The one with umbrellas over the seating area)- they will definitely price gouge."
Definitely a must visit place on your visit to Hue so beautiful and so much history and a great way to relax is It walking around and enjoying the splendid old buildings in a nice relaxed atmosphere. Would defimtely go back again
"Very nice place to visit and I think it could be great if there was a guide to learn its history. Even after war, but it still keep it originally. Such a must see place."
"A beautiful snapshot of history.
Picturesque scenery with interesting architecture, but a reminder of the Vietnam war where some of the Citadel has been destroyed."
A beautiful place to visit. So much history and beautiful gardens. Enjoyed the 3D viewing at the end too
"Even though many of the buildings were bombed to oblivion enough stunning temples pagodas and palaces remain among the beautiful gardens to make this a must see site that will fill a half day or a whole day if you are thorough. We opted for the self guided tour with audio guide but got lost more than once. Partly this was due to the sheer size of the complex but also a lot of the locations did not have audio guide numbers displayed and the map they gave to accompany the guide was not complete, perhaps due to ongoing renovations. Nevertheless well worth a visit but beware as always the crippling Summer heat and humidity. Stick to the shade where possible and don't be afraid to partake of the many refreshment stops available. Usual dress code applies for entry to sacred sites. Knees and shoulders must be covered and always show respect."
"The citadel opens at 8 am, by 9 it’s sweltering. Advice: arrive around 4:30 pm as the sun is setting and the temps and brutal sun softening. It stays open into the evening and the hoards are gone. Start your tour moving counter-clockwise, as the best sites are to the left of the entrance. Bring plenty of water. There are rest spots along the way, one with a beautiful moat and rock formation."
"The imperial city was added into one of our tours as we had limited time in Hue and we really wanted to visit this. We weren't let down, this area is so full of history and it used to be the capital in ancient times. There are a few original buildings which are incredible and there are some modern re builds which weren't popular with our guide. The giant ponds filled with Lotus flowers are beautiful. A must see in Hue."
"Kinda cool but compared to other wonders invthisvpart ofvthe world, it was nothing special. We also arrived during the hit season which made it less enjoyable."
"This was a must see, you could spend all day walking around!! I think if you’re in Hue this is a must see!!"
Even in the heat thoroughly enjoyed the history -the audio tour was around £4 and loved the long red corridors in the forbidden city . Fantastic old photos . Surprised at how quiet the place was in the middle of the day . Paid 25 p to park our hotel bikes in the car park area outside 😄
"Depends what you expect. This isn't old.by European standards, covering a historical dynasty that lasted from 1802-1945. Much of it has been.destroyed by war and while the government is working hard to renovate it, there's still a.lot to be done. Worth visiting if you are in Hue but not (in my opinion) worth coming specially to see."
"Similar to the Chinese one, the kings city is also damaged by war. However it gives an impression about the Vietnamese past."
"We were really disappointed with the main attraction in Hue. Almost no explanations and not well-kept. The only places they had brought to life cist extra, for example their lantern workshops and 3D-rides. But of course still okay to walk around there."
I still think that the price for the ticket is up there in relation to different vietnamese tickets (150.000 vnd normally 30.000) but if you like nice gardens and architecture you could spend half a day here.
If you have come to Hue you have to the visit the imperial palace and surrounds as that is it’s reason for being. Learn of the imperial rule before the French came back and see the impressive grounds created. It’s really hot but trees provide cover but bring lots of cold water with you. Best to get a guide as it’s more interesting but looks like an audio tour available as well
"Worth waking up early to get there before the crowds, wondering about and just absorbign the beauty of this historic place. Even in the heat of June it was was worth spending a few hours here."
"Were expecting ruins, but there is actually a lot left to be awed by. We took the audio guides and it was perfect for us: we could go at our own rhythm without having to open the guide book all the time."
Hue was the most beautiful city in Vietnam that we saw. We saw a lot of temples and such on our trip and this was a unique treat among a lot of things that tend to be similar.
Visited here from a cruise ship docked in Chan May. The ancient citadel is a huge complex of buildings from palace to temple.
Very interesting history here and fun to explore the huge grounds and buildings. One could only imagine if the walls could talk the stories they would tell! Especially during battles with American troops in the citadel! My kids thought they recognise call of duty map. Yet very hot when we visit so hard to enjoy as 40c and the heat comes out of the concrete on the ground so be prepared to sweat.
"Although hot, our trip to Hue was a memorable one because of its beautiful buildings. We appreciated the English descriptions in the outdoor galleries. Its too bad more of the buildings aren't restored! We noticed a lot of them are still destroyed. The lily pads were also a sight to see!"
"Long walk (don't bother with the buggies) but well worth a look around. Lots of buildings with not much info or furniture inside, but there were also quite a few with lots of signs and old relics.
Stunning architecture and gardens"
"We enjoyed the immersion in (relatively recent) history. It is very hot though at this time so year so best to visit early or late on the day. We planned to use the audio tour but were told at the gate it wasn’t available. This was likely either incorrect or it is in development as we saw multiple audio stations throughout and a place to return audio guides at the exit.

Easy to access by local (metered) taxi, and signs are in Vietnamese with English translations. Get a combined ticket if planning to visit multiple tombs within the next two days. Best to visit here first."
essential to visit to get a flavour of the ancient history of vietnam very pleasant 2 hours walking around the gronds and buildings go early in morning to avoid the heat of the day . Then take lunch at Les Jardins de la Carambole - 5 minute taxi ride - check it out.
"Organised directly with our hotel to take a boat to the pagoda and then get dropped off at the citadel. Give yourself time, we were there a couple of hours. There’s a lot of ground to cover, we walked, however there are small electric cars to take you around once inside if the heat gets too much. Outside the cyclists offer to take you but they are not allowed inside and will only take you around the outer wall. This was an amazing site to see."
"Offer a great way to understand the life of Vietnamese rulers, however you must take the time to explore the entire area, not just the front gate area, It s huge and tiring."
"We visited the Imperial City on 7 July and hired a guide for 150,000 VND for about an hour. Although no as impressive as the Imperial City in Beijing, but is still worth a visit while in Hue. The compound is huge and needs at least 2-3 hours to explore. Entrance fee 150,000 VND per person."
"Huge Imperial city, with some pretty solid displays and exhibitions. Lots of placards in English and Vietnamese that are relatively easy to follow. Much better than the displays and exhibits at local pagodas and tombs which can be hard to decipher and appreciate. Its about 100K Dong per foreigner to enter. You can also hire a guide at the entrance. Cars are banned and the only vehicles allowed in are electric carts (guide operated) or employee motorbikes. Thus, its a nice walking tour free from the usual motorbike traffic trying to runover tourists and locals alike. Pretty peaceful walk, but wear comfortable clothing (that doesn’t mean shirtless or bikini tops) that’s appropriate, otherwise you’ll be refused entrance. Sunscreen and a hat are musts. Even during the cooler times of year, the sun will beat down on you. There are a number of food/drink stalls inside the Imperial City, so options abound to grab food and cold drinks while walking. Bathrooms available too. Plan to take at least 2-3 hours to see the City. Alot of it remains under restoration, much of this being due to the wanton death and destruction that took place here during Tet ‘68. If they’d put out proper placards to explain this, tourists would get alot more out of it, but such is life in Vietnam. An umbrella or poncho in your pack for potential afternoon storms is a good idea too. Plan to be walking and standing alot during this walking tour, but it’s absolutely worth it."
"The citadel is an amazing place. There is so much to explore here and everything is so stunning. It’s so big and the heat makes you exhausted quickly. Once inside, we found the electric carts. We hired a cart for 45 minutes for 240,000vnd (approx A$17.00). Well worth it. It drove us round to the various buildings and waited whilst we explored them. Carts hold up to 7 people. 45 minutes goes by very quickly. They drop you at the exit when your time is up. We hadn’t seen enough, so we walked around some more and then hired another cart. We got the driver to stop at places we didn’t get to see on the first trip. Well worth the money and allowed us to enjoy so much more than we could have walking in that heat. There are lots of places to stop and sit and buy cool drinks as well as nice souviners. You don’t need to have knees and shoulders covered to enter or walk around the citadel. But you do need to cover shoulders and remove shoes and hats to enter some of the buildings. There are audio sets available, but we missed seeing where to get these before we went in. They would have made the experience better. There was no maps to walk around with, only signs with maps. So it made it difficult to know where to walk or where you’ve been. However, we lived exploring and stayed about 3 hours, this included many stops for cool drinks!!"
This is a good place to end your tour of tombs in Hue. The history is rich and the garden is beautiful
This is a very beautiful building and one that seems to command much respect from the Vietnamese. It is superbly constructed and gives a real sense of majesty.
"Very busy for most of the day.
Go early or late.
Takes a good hour and a half to walk around.
Interesting history lesson
A must do when in Hue"
"The Imperial City is a must see.
It was huge and has great architecture.
Make sure you bring a fan as it gets very hot there"
We changed our original itinerary to include an overnight stop in Hue to visit the Imperial City and it was worth it. An impressive site with information at each building. It was not busy at all and visiting felt relaxed.
Well worth the 4th visit. Still so much to see and learn from and the restorations are only serving to create better learning opportunities
"We toured the citadel in a day with 100+ degrees F, so maybe better in a cooler day. The sprawling complex was impressive, and it really showcased a different time in Vietnam's long history than other sites. However, there was so much work being done, that it was unclear how much of what we saw was truly original and how much was rebuilt for tourism"
"It was nice to walk around and see all the site. I would recommend to do the Virtual Reality Tour (50,000 dong tour is enough) when you first arrive. It is through the entrance and to the right. This, although way too quick, gives you an overview of the main Palaces and Residence.

There are many photos hung up, but unfortunately they did not have dates, nor were they in the vicinity of the building in the photo.

Do some research about the Nguyen Dynasty before you go as I found it hard to take it all in.

They are rebuilding many areas/ buildings and there is many areas/ buildings that may not ever get rebuilt.

I would like to think that 150,000 dong entrance fee was going into the maintenance of this vast site and the rebuilding of this historical site."
"We enjoyed the visit by hiring an Electric Bus (1 hour with stops at various notable structures 300,000 dong for up to 7 people). People who have said there is not much to see (!) were perhaps lacking this kind of guidance -the driver told us where he was stopping, and the name of the structure, and suggested how long to take. There were some notices in english at our stops. We particularly liked the theatre, with its display of costumes and masks, and the Queen Mother's House with the furniture and clothing. Also, criticisms that it is 'run down' seem to ignore the fact that the whole complex was bombed by the Americans during the Vietnam War, and restoration is still on-going - this is where the entrance fees go, of course."
"Hot and big. I recommend you avoid a group or organized tour. Take your time. Before entering the citadel enjoy a pedal cab ride around the outside for an hour. Was very reasonable and hits a few lovely places including museums.

Inside the citadel find the electric trams and rent one for an hour. It's more than enough time to see the entire place and beats walking. The tram is at your beck and call for the allotted time. It'll drop you at the best spots and wait to take you to the next one.

Remember that it will likely be very hot. Hydrate and keep drinking lots of bottled water."
Old city well lit at night. On the traditional quieter side of the city. My trip was made memorable because I had a great driver and guide! Phai is the best driver you can find in Hue! Call him at 0931-75-5252. He has the best rates and takes you beyond the time agreed. He does not scam like most other drivers in the city. It is important to travel with a peace of mind.
"Expansive site, lots of walking, not a lot of direction on what to do or where to go but we had to visit."
"We arrived quite early in the morning (after visiting one of the imperial tombs) and were there before the crowds! We didn't have a guided tour, but, as there were so many detailed signs about, I don't think we missed out! Take your time, as it is a vast site. There was a cafe by the gardens/ ponds, where we stopped for ice-cream and to enjoy the surrounds! The only negative aspect of the experience was when we were approached by a person who presented themself as a ""teacher, doing survey"" who was soliciting donations for something."
"After almost two weeks in Vietnam we ended our stay here by visiting this. Having already seen lots of temples and historical buildings, this managed to trump them all. The beauty and elegance of it is just amazing. Recommended for anyone who likes history/culture or just beautiful architecture."
"Huế City is a small town so don’t expect to find a ton of things to do. The main attraction is the Citadel where you can see the palaces where royalty once lived. The place is HUGE, so we didn’t get around to seeing everything. It was a really hot day, so we were a little over walking around seeing the same type of things. You can also pay for a tour, but we decided not to do that & explore the grounds ourselves.

The one thing they do try to do to help with the heat is have small refreshment stands throughout the place. You can take a break under the shade, buy water, food & even beer!

I found the place rich with history, but it wasn’t a “fun” place. It’s like spending a day at the museum & learning about the history of their culture."
We were impressed with the half day visit of the citadel. The ground was well kept and our tour guide was very knowledgeable . We saw beautiful restoration of some of the structures and workers working in the heat during the day to preserve the history.
"I found that many tourists skip Hue while visiting other cities. Then, they said not much historical places in Vietnam. It was because they did not visit Hue. In particular, the Citadel should be one that tourists should visit. Also, I made a mistake to buy a package including the citadel and a couple of tombs. It would be nice to visit a couple of tombs if you have some time."
"To learn more of the history of Vietnam, it is a must to visit this site. It's easy to reach the place by any means of transportation, including Grab bike. All information of the palace is available around the site.
You need to visit the citadel after sunset to see wonderful lighting display of the entrance."
"The Citadel was my second location during my trip around Hue. Lots of history and culture and well worth a visit.
Make sure you wear a hat and take plenty of water as not much shade and very hot!!!"
"If you are not going to this place, you're not visiting Hue yet. Very big, take hours to go all of these places. It's very hot and have to buy water. Interesting place to take photos."
"Came here as wanted to learn the culture and history,very interesting and beautiful buildings but be warned like anywhere else it’s all about extracting the cash from your wallet."
"Really not much to see and what there is, isn't very impressive. It's a sprawling complex of very average ruins and buildings. There's far nicer/better things to see/do around Hue."
"The Imperial City (Citadel) is probably the main reason most tourists come to Hue. It is nice and definitely worth a visit. I expected it to be better and was underwhelmed but it still is the must see attraction in town. 150000 to go in and then extra charges if you want a VR or dress up experience, but I think these are for the locals"
"We spent a nice afternoon spent wandering the grounds of the Imperial City. There is so much history here and so much to read as u wander through the Citadel.

It was a pity the American/French and Vietnamese forces did so much damage to the facility, especially in the back section. But the good news is they are slowly rebuilding it to its former glory.

The reason we gave this 3 stars was because of the signage, or lack there of. Time and time again we ended up in the wrong area. I recommend the curators go visit the Forbidden City and see how to sign the Citadel properly.

Look forward to coming back in the years to come as the buildings rise up again."
Spent a few hours inside the grounds and so much history to take in and appreciate...a very peaceful and expansive experience..a must see destination if heading to Vietnam
"We went early and it was a good decision as later it can be hectic,we had a guide and he was very good explaining the history and stories of the Kings and inner workings of the imperial city.
Worthwhile visit"
The imperial city and the people forbidden city are a great half day filling activity (entrance is 150k). It has some very beautiful gardens and interesting buildings.
"Well worth seeing if you are in Hue.

I would suggest to go on a tour so you have a tour guide to give you the history behind the citadel.

Tours are very well priced."
"Very very nice
Walking around with our guide
He gave us a good idea of what it was.
Well worth a visit"
"Was so hot when we came here. Besides the weather the place was interesting to visit and we had a tour guide who spoke good english. She said the tour would take an hour but she finished in 45 mins and took off after she said the tour finished, she appeared disinterested to weather we had questions and was quite rude when she left. Make sure to come here when its not so hot and bring water with you."
Amazing scenary and would highly recommend getting a guide to understand the huge history. Make sure you take plant of water as it is quite exposed when it is hot.
The citadel is well worth a visit. It has a very interesting history and it is well preserved. Loved wandering around it.
"The imperial city is huge. You could walk around for hours and still not see half of what’s there. Would advise to go very early or not in summer as it can be uncomfortable on a very hot and humid day.

The temples are beautiful and worth seeing. There was an electric car tour that we booked for 45 minutes but were only brought to 3 places and it did not last the time we had paid for. Then we were just left in the middle of the city. I would not recommend the electric car."
"The Imperial City (or Citadel) is a must-see in Hue. We visited in summer when Hue's weather was sunny and hot (as opposed to the rainy, cold weather it has a reputation for). We got to the city mid-morning, and I would recommend arriving right when the place opens so you can get the place to yourself, and you can take advantage of the cool morning before it gets to hot.

We opted not to take the electric tram around the city, but for people with mobility issues, that would be a good way to see this place. It is HUGE, definitely two hours to visit in my opinion. Photographers and history lovers could spend a lot longer I'm sure.

There are bathrooms throughout, and vendors who sell water and some packaged snacks like chips and cookies in case you get hungry. There's a cafe where you can get iced coffee too.

The city is in various states of restoration, so some buildings are completely restored, others are screened off, and others are piles of rubble. The restored buildings are beautiful, and you can go inside most of them (cool off!) and peruse the displays inside (some have English). I recommend bringing a guidebook or google to get an idea of the history to make it more interesting.

Oh, and the entrance and the exit are different - the entrance is the main gate, and the exit is the east gate (follow the signs). We took green taxi to the main gate with no problem, and caught one at the exit no problem.

I recommend the combo ticket with the tombs - good for 2 days and saves some money.

Highly recommended for anyone visiting Hue!

If you found this review helpful, give it a thumbs up to help other travellers find it!"
"There was plenty to see and read about on our way round, and what was well worth visiting was the virtual reality experience which lasted a few minutes and was very inexpensive (can’t remember exactly how much) but gave you a tour with a moving seat and virtual 4D reality headset of what the Citadel may have been like. It pieced together everything we had just walked round."
"We were only in Hue for one night and visited the Imperial City the morning we were leaving and loved it. Wished we had left ourselves more time to explore it properly, would definitely like to return. So much to see and the morning we were there it was very quiet, which was awesome. The shop had loads of great stuff and you can see craftspeople making a lot of it - wonderful lady making intricate fans. Would definitely recommend."
It seems like a part of an old Asian history that you visit because that’s what you do when you’re a tourist in Vietnam. But look at it from a broader perspective and its significance reaches a lot closer to home.
"Beautiful buildings in an idyllic setting. So much history!
There needs to be more rubbish bins to encourage the tourists to dispose of their rubbish responsibly....."
"In the Nguyen Dynasty (1802-1945) this was the centre of power. It includes a range of places to visit, including the Flag Tower, Noon Gate, Nine Dynastic Urns, Nine Holy Cannons, the Thao Hoa Palace and the Forbidden Purple City. Remember to wear clothes that cover knees and shoulders for this visit. As you exit the Citadel it is worth taking a boat trip on the Perfume River."
"Very well maintained and in places restored Imperial city from 1805
Some of the architecture in tile and masonry is very impressive, the throne room and library particularly so
Gardens are well maintained"
"We enjoyed a guided tour around the citadel and really enjoyed it. It is best to visit it first up in the morning as it can get very hot and walking around amongst the buildings with little airflow makes you get even hotter. So take water and try to stay in the shade where you can. Also if you want to visit some of the special rooms and temples make sure you have shoes you can easily remove...and don't forget, no photos or wearing hats inside.
A must see!"
"The Old Imperial City or the Citadel is a must to visit when you are in Hue, my partner and myself took a tour on the 15th May 2019 so we could have everything explained to us by an experienced guide, there is a charge to enter the Citadel but all that is covered in the tour.

The outer walls are massive and then you proceed to the next wall and moats leading into the Citadel and another wall when you reach the forbidden city, the buildings that are still standing are impressive and the whole city must have been outstanding before it was bombed by the US during the Vietnam War.

To see the whole complex of buildings you need to allow yourself plenty of time as there are many photos of the old City as well as the rulers, we found that our guide was very helpful and explained many things to us that you would not know if you went on your own, we booked our tour through Han Travel who were excellent.

On the way out you will see shops that sell souvenirs the prices are good and cheaper than the markets, also it helps to maintain this beautiful Imperial City."
"For westerners,

If you want to travel in Vietnam, you must accept the local culture and custom, no matter how they are.
You do not have the right to tell the local to change their life as they also can not tell the same thing to you.
Stop to show up as you are not good as you thought to local."
We loved visiting this ancient city. The architecture was splendid and it was easy to imagine it in its glory days. We spent hours in the garden taking amazing and creative photographs for my yoga site. I feel the water could be cleaner and the gardens needed a good drink and a little more love but it didn’t detract from our experience. A must see for travelers.
"Interesting place to visit, would recommend this to anyone coming to Hue, you must purchase a ticket to enter. Their is English translation under all photos. Their are tour guides if you wish, but not for free."
"I expected a lot of tourists in this area. But due to the huge dimensions of the imperial city you have no problems getting nice photos without anyone in them. Many nice old buildings / Temples still standing in the city. Some more information signs would be good, but you can definitely send a few hours in this area. It can be very hot and there is not a lot of shadow. So bring some sun protection. Water can be bought at different street vendors inside the imperial city."
"What an amazing experience! There are so many exhibitions and rooms to enter, most of which have detailed information to read if you choose.

Because we didn’t have as much time to explore as we would have liked to and the weather was extremely hot we took an electric car 45 minute tour which took us to the main buildings and drove us around the majority of the complex.

Would highly recommend, we enjoyed it thoroughly!"
"The place is impressive but far not enough maintained, highlighted, interactive and it's a pity..
I'm wondering all the money from the entrance fees+UNESCO invests are going.."
Really nice place to visit and take photos. I recommend going later in the day and then walking along to the riverside after.
"This was part of our group tour, we were with Tweet World Tour Group, an excellent tour group. Our local guide was very knowledgeable and the tour was very interesting, although May is a very hot time to be visiting Vietnam.
When touring countries you should always be respectful of their beliefs etc. ladies please adhere to their request, tops or dresses with shoulders covered and sleeves, and shorts or dresses covering the knees, if not you may be turned away
It was worth the visit"
"If you are a person who likes history, perhaps this is worth for you to visit. The whole area is quite huge, my family and I were a bit lost there as we went there without a guide. Basically it's old buildings from the past kingdom and it has many sections. If you have been to China, this will not impress you much and the entrance fee is not cheap either."
"I was surprised to find I really enjoyed the Imperial City. It has been restored empathetically in parts and there is still much to do. Old photos adorned walls and provided an opportunity to go back in time without being overwhelmed by its history. The mostly unrestored gardens have rough grass and provide views within the grounds that help get a measure of its size and ersthwhile grandeur. There are also a few biting flies around.

Many Asian tourists queued to be dressed as mandarins and emperors for a short photo shoot, much to the amusement of family and other on-lookers, including me ! There is a gallery of local art, some of it traditional, some stylised modern. I did fall for the artistly and bought a painting which once back in the UK takes a moment or three to identify as a laden rickshaw in the rain.

The City was copied by the Chinese for the Beijing Forbidden City although they made theirs much larger.

It is extremely hot here and refreshment limit so make sure you have water."
"Due to historical reasons, the imperial palace had been through quite a bit of abuse. There isn’t much original structure or rooms left behind but from the site one can imagine how magnificent the palaces must have been."
"There is quite huge area good to learn the last Imperial of Hue. Please don't forget to buy ticket to enter onside. There are also a golf car service just pay 120,000VND"
"The Hue Imperial Palace is an impressive must see destination in Hue, Vietnam. Make sure to bring your camera and take some time to appreciate the many sights."
"This is a very impressive complex, well preserved and a delight to visit. This a a must see while in Hue"
A very neat tour of the old Imperial City/Citadel. This was the scene of very intense fighting during three 1968 Tet offensive. You can still see damage from the battle.
"Power center of Vietnam kingdom, this citadel is a must visit. Though only 20% of what actually remain after American war. What remaining itself is marvelous. Highly recommended."
Very beautiful place. Rich of culture and story. Huge area and very hot. Must bring sun protection and water.
We hesitated in making a stop in Hue on our way down to HCM city but we don’t regret it. It’s a beautiful sight even though I wonder how much more we could have seen hadn’t the war destroyed most of it. Still a can’t miss in Vietnam
"We visited here as part of our tour
Our guide was very good and informative
A lot of history a large site and the reconstruction is amazing
Well worth a visit"
"A must see, begin as early as possible in hot weather as very little shade in walking areas, A hat is a must and keep fluids up. Pretty flat area so easy walking. Pity a lot of buildings destroyed during war, and also trees as some areas have nice shaded areas."
I travelled from Singapore to visit the Imperial City Citadel. It is well worth it. A truly breathtaking and overwhelming experience. I think it rivals Angkor Wat in scale and human achievement.
"please try to get there as early as possible or else you might faint from the heat!
Especially between 11-15!"
"You cannot miss to see the Imperial City if you are close to Hue and I would highly recommend to take a guide otherwise you will just walk through it without knowing the meaning of the architecture. The place is in very good shape. The tour takes around 2 hours, we did it with 2 young children and it was ok."
"We flew from Hanoi to our next destination, Hue in central Vietnam. It’s very beautiful here, in April it is the height of summer and at 38-42c was extremely hot. We were met by our lovely guide Sammy who took us to visit the Citadel Imperial City. After visiting the city, we drove to La Chu Village, located about 8km out from Hue city centre. We hoped on bicycles and cycled through this beautiful very tranquil village, famous for its herbs and veggies like coriander and basil 🌿, it’s rice paddies which were ripe for harvesting and it’s beautiful lotus flower ponds and water lilies. We stopped to visit two local families. One family produces the paper votive offerings, a popular and strong belief among the Vietnamese at the family home alter for their ancestors. The second family we visited specialize in making Banh Loc, a kind of Vietnamese pie made of rice flour or semolina and mixed with Shrimp. Steve got to taste both! We finished the day with a beautiful and tasty lunch at a local family restaurant with views of the rice fields and enjoyed fig and peanut salad, egg pancake stuffed with tofu and vegetables, spring rolls, soup and spiced tofu washed down with a local beer...beautiful, fresh and extremely tasty 😋 The hospitality and beauty of the local people is abundant. Whilst in Hue, we stayed in the beautiful Pilgrimage Village Resort."
"No kidding, the sun would kill you in 10 mins if you visit during 10-16. A very peaceful ancient town."
This place reflect the vietnam in ancient time. Specially the golden lines on the red buildings it's increasing the beauty of palace into a new level
"If you are in Hue do yourself a favor & visit the Imperial City. Well worth a vist as is many other activities. I had 2 days & should have had minimum 4 days.
Enjoy
best regards
Andrew"
"No visitor to Hue should forgo a visit to this landmark of the old city. With its National Flag flying high and visible from afar it is but a short ride from most of the accommodation facilities. While the so called ""Forbidden City"" is but a shadow of its Beijing namesake it is full of interest architecturally and historically nonetheless. The truly amazing aspect, to me at any rate, was to realise that barely half a century ago it was the scene of one of the fiercest and most devastating battles of the war. Superb restoration indeed! And the remnant ruins only add to the awe the wanderer within feels for this venerable centuries old wonder of the city."
"The Imperial City is a sprawling walled complex that housed the first emperor of a unified Vietnam in 1789. It is a 6,5 km square complex with 6 temples of worship, 4 outer courts and 14 inner courts. I detailed plan would have been a good tool to have in order to properly navigate the complex. A lot of renovations have been completed and have brought life back to this citadel. There is lots to see: lavishly decorated gates, pavilions, ponds, gardens, bonsai trees, artefacts, etc."
"We enjoyed visiting The Citadel, an extremely important place in Vietnamese history and culture. So much to see and easy to get around."
"We booked one day tour from hoi an to hue, this site is the first place we have been when coming to Hue. It was not made us disappointed, it's so breathtaking and stunning. The tour guide told us many things about history of this site, all of us were so impressed. You also can pay a little money to make some photos with uniform of vietnamese king. Although I like Hoi An more than Hue but it's still a great day for us to explore Hue."
Came here to see the area on a free and easy timing however was talked into using a trishaw to get around. Bad experience as did not bring to the areas I wanted to see and only outside the old city. Cost me about 100000 VND/pax for an hour ride.
"This was a enormous city, make sure to have enough time so you don’t miss anything. If you like history and culture this is a must!"
"Be aware of how hot the visit can be! This part of the city, will be on foot and can be self guided but a lot of people seem to participate as a larger group experience."
"The life of the former royal family must have been quite an event !
This cultural icon is a must see."
"Enter through the Ngo Mon Gate (the only entrance) and current cost is 150000 vnd ($9cad). While there are signs, its best to do a bit of research/reading before you go. I found a great article on tripsavvy.com (not promoting, easily found on internet search). It highlights the main sights with great descriptions.

The grounds are immaculate, with beautiful flowers and landscaping. It is a bit confusing and we did wander aimlessly at first. Recommend doing one side then the other. There is an inner pavillion and an outer. Some buildings are in the process of being re-constructed as there was previous war and weather damage.

You can hire an electric car tour to save you some walking as it can be quite hot and sweaty walking from one building to the next. Most tourist groups arrive early to avoid the heat. It settles down around 11 when you can have unobstructed photos and quieter atmosphere.

Notice the works on some of the gates...truly remarkable."
My legs got wobbly after a 5 hour walk in this heavenly palace. I enjoyed everything this Citadel tour could offer.
"Very picturesque, cool taste of Vietnam if travelling through Hue. Best with mopeds to drive over if needed!"
"The citadel is a great place to visit and learn about the Nguyen dynasty of Vietnam. Really sad that this was ruined in the war, however good restoration efforts. We had a tour guide which was helpful to learn about the history of all the kings and the citadel as well as navigate the large site. Lots of walking."
It was great and I didn't expect it to be that big but there could be more information sign about the history facts at this beautiful place.
Very interesting place to visit with lots of temples and residences of the former emperor and his family. Tickets are sold in combination with entrance to other sites such as tombs. These sites are however located at some distance from the imperial city (think twice before buying combi-tickets).
"Visited as part of a tour group. Thought this was interesting, lots of history to discover , we enjoyed looking at the buildings....love the sculptures on the roofs. Just a good place to wander and look at the gardens .

Stood and looked at the huge Vietnamese Flag before going into The Citadel, lots of students having graduation photos taken which added to ambiance."
"To be honest our visit to the Imperial Citadel was a bit of a dampener, perhaps due to the scorching hot weather as it was 32 deg C and we were not in much of a mood to wander around in the blazing sun.

That being said, the Citadel is quite iconic and looks really nice, though we have seen much nicer and better preserved ancient ruins elsewhere. It was still a box to check. A bit too much walking, so if you have kids, best to avoid it.... unless you go when the sun is not so harsh."
It is a UNESCO world heritage site. It is huge and there is a lot of walking. A large portion had been destroyed and the Vietnamese government is restoring the building. Lot of history.
Its a huge area with lovely entrance. Hue imperial city dates back to 1800's and is a lovely area to get around. lots of picturesque facades and lovely wall pictures/paintings do make this place a worth visit.
"We traveled with 4 kids (ages 8,6,4,2) and my parents. Obviously this is a MUST see when in Hue.

We enjoyed it, despite the temperature being 39c. Kids did ok. We actually hired a mini tour and had one person take us through the Citadel and then to the Pagoda. This helped because she added a lot of information for the Citadel. Definitely would recommend something like this because it’s adds some of the history, otherwise I think it might get old fast. It’s the story behind it all that makes what you’re seeing impressive.

Our tour guide was good. We booked her through our hotel Century Riverside. Her name was Hà."
"This a huge unbelievable complex. So much to see. It has a 6 miles outer wall. There are 2 moats.

Inside, they are magnificent gardens, Imperial palace, royal library, temple, and Supreme harmony House.

Definitely the must see site in Hue.

Make sure you wear comfortable shoes, a lot of walking."
The site is large and will take around 2-3 hours to fully explore it. I recommend buying a Vietnamese hat for shade and pretty pictures as photo opportunities are everywhere. Take a picnic and relax in the reading garden.
"Beautiful historical site In Hue. Big site and well worth the visit. Lots of interesting facts, beautiful buildings and garden areas"
take the time to visit this place which represent the past history that Vietnamese people are proud of. Magnificent place for buddism lovers.
"It was nice to see all the old architecture but other than some old documents, there was little explanation on the history of the place to make it more interesting."
"My, who became our friend last year, took us to visit the Citadel and former Royal Palace and Forbidden City. To view everything that is here to see takes a full day if you take it at an easy pace. We found it very interesting and great efforts have been made to restore the damage from the several occupations and wars that Vietnam has suffered."
"We went on a really hot day so it was challenging, but well worth it. Before I went I had read a description about the place that it was “poetry in buildings”. I thought that was likely to be hyperbole. It wasn’t!! The place is literally architecturally poetic, especially the meditation pavilion, beautifully shaped and surrounded by gardens of bonsai. There is a picturesque swimming tank, and lots of photos of the former royals and various mandarins which were interesting. Highly recommended."
"Lavish and extraordinary on a scale approaching the Forbidden City in Beijing, I admit it is easy to 'glaze over' after a while and finish the tour on autopilot. But once I had tired of the guide's recital of how many wives each king had, and how many wars he took part in, I was still admiring the sheer beauty of the buildings and settings, waiting for my tour group to move so I could take pictures without random strangers, then scurrying to catch up with them again. My advice is to make sure you have the time to just wander and enjoy at your own pace for a while, the historical information is all there in guide books if you want to read it."
"There really isn't much to see. Loads of empty rooms, some old photographs and that's about it. The most fun was feeding the fish. Quite disappointing considering we payd 150000 dong each for entrance."
Managed to get an overcast day so the temperature was pretty cool walking around this magnificent piece of architecture and history. Enjoyed walking around the various structures however getting a guided tour would have been better.
"We walked around for hours, there's so much to see! The only thing that was bothering me at times was the blatant disrespect of some people. Don't let your kids stand on top of the exhibitions! Plastic in the Koi ponds as well ..."
"When you visit the place you can go either on foot or electrical car. Don’t waste your money on electrical car, really isn’t worth it because you get a very quickly ride with no explanation at all you will barely see the place."
"it is extremely hot so I would suggest going either super early in the morning or late in the evening. Not sure when they close, but we went around 2 PM. It is stunning even in its current state. We unfortunately left early rather than exploring the miles of grounds because of the heat. Next time we will have to plan it better."
"This is a magnificent series of buildings, still being renovated after being largely destroyed in 1968. Not a lot of shade, so visit early if there in the hot part of the year."
"Fascinating visit through the heat of the day. Massive area that has loads if different temples, rooms and stunning gardens"
If you stay in Hue you must walk among these ancient walls. Well preserved and surrounded by water they are really beautiful to walk around. Walking through the gate and going in you can find ancient buildings : the throne and the theater are wonderful. Many photos can help visitors to imagine how was life here 100 years ago. I do suggest a visit early in the morning when it’s not really hot nor crowded. Ask for a guide: highly recommended
"We decided to make an early start for our visit to Hue’s forbidden city. And to add to our excitement, we decided to go by cyclo. These are three-wheeled, pedal-powered contraptions invented by the French as an alternative to the rickshaw. They also add yet more insanity to the traffic mix in Vietnam.

They are a languid form of transport that travel at no more than 5mph or so. The fact that you are sat forward of the driver and effectively become the bumper of the vehicle didn’t prevent the peddling pilot from mixing it with the rush hour chaos. Almost as if a Cyclo is as impregnable as a Sherman Tank. They’ll take on all-comers be they buses, coaches or buzzing swarms of scooters. What do they care? They have a lovely plump tourist acting as a copiously stuffed airbag. All they have to do is point and pedal. The rest I suspect is left to fate.

And fate played us a winning hand delivering us safely to Hue’s Purple Imperial city.

Known as the Citadel, it was the seat of power of the largely-ceremonial Vietnamese Nguyen Royal Family. The extensive network of buildings and structures housed and serviced a hermetically sealed society of royals, mandarins, eunuchs, concubines and courtiers.

Here they played out the elaborate rituals and strict royal protocols that made up the imperial admin’. This was a detailed set of laws, customs and codes designed to honour and serve the king who by the mid-twentieth century was little more than a totem under the administration of the French imperial machine.

After WW2, and the changes that ensued after that, the Royal‘s fate was sealed, and the forbidden city became a mere anachronism. A symbol of a past that would never return. The Citadel became an irrelevance.

Until 1968 that is. In January that year, the Viet Cong launched its most significant challenge so far to secure a victory in the ongoing war of attrition. It became known as the Tet offensive and saw some of the bloodiest battles of the American war.

The Citadel was an epicentre of brutal hand to hand fighting with frequent aerial bomb raids that destroyed many of the buildings reducing them to rubble. The offensive also saw many summary executions of collaborators of the ’puppet’ southern Vietnam republic making it a notorious war crimes black spot.

That's why The Citadel has it all: ancient history, French Imperialism and the excesses of the Vietnam War. There are few places in the country that can offer so much insight into the story of this nation. If you're in Hue a visit here is a must."
"There is a lot to see at the site, and we like walking, but it was extremely hot, and the site is vast and not very well signed, so we only covered about a quarter before we left. Perhaps a guided tour would have helped. There were some interesting buildings and the Fine Art Museum was good. Unfortunately you can’t go back into the site more than once."
We walked aroound the citadel on what was the hottest day in April 2019...a record breaker. Probably would have stayed longer if it wasn't as hot. Amazing spot.
"The grounds are incredibly large, be prepared to walk a lot. The buildings are stunning and there is a lot of rich history to the place, most of which is explained in boards around the area."
So much history and it wasn't overly crowded! Take plenty of water and good walking shoes. There are also snacks and refreshments available for purchase.
Unfortunately it was very hot and this was our last stop of the day and we were very tired. We pooped out. What we did see was very interesting and would return to Hue and put this on the top of the list.
This place is definitely worth a visit. Went on a Monday morning and found ourselves wandering in large parts of it by ourselves. The rear of the enclosure was particularly quiet and serene. If only all attractions were like this. Parts of it are run down and have yet to be restored. I think this only adds to charm of the place.
This is why you come to Hue. The scale of this place is mind blowing! Definitely allow plenty of time. It's huge.
"Beautiful, historical site with so much to see. You'll be surprised to learn some of the buildings are not actually that old, and some of them are just ruins. Everything is so beautiful, to the smallest detail. You'll see all the asian styles mixing up in the most beautiful way. Just go. The tickets were I believe 250 000 dong per person (11-12 USD), and we spent about 3 hours here to see it all. Super recommended!"
Beautiful city with great people and amazing nightlife you just have to be wary of some of the scams
This is a very beautiful place to visit with its history. Walking the tree lined streets to and from the Citadel make this a pleasant visit even on a hot day.
"A great visit and worth spending a good 2 hours to allow time to see the imperial city as well as the citadel. The imperial city hides little gems such as the emperor's gardens which are overlooked by tour operators rushing through the citadel, in and out in less than an hour. We had a private guide and enjoyed listening to her stories while strolling around. The citadel was heavily damaged by the war in 1968 but it is gradually being restored to its formal glory."
"When it's hot out ....and that's many months of the year .....I would recommend getting there are at 7 a.m. when it opens. I had a plan and covered the key highly rated buildings from the Michelin app. Even with a plan I made some mistakes.

The entrance is on the South Side facing the river in the middle of the South Wall. I did not know this and the grab driver was taking me to the north side and had to reroute all the way back.

Since the exit is on the east wall Midway, I would recommend the following route that ends up at the East Gate with the fewest steps.

Take your transportation or Taxi to the South entrance along the river but go a few meters to the right to the ticket booth. If you go to the gate without the ticket you have to go all the way to the ticket booth and back to the entrance gate.

Once you enter the gate, turn left and go to the southwest corner to the Hien Lam Pavillion. You can walk or find out how to use the huge golf cart type Electric vehicles which save you time and keep you out of the Sun.

From The Pavilion then go a few feet north to the Mieu. Again these are all the highest rated buildings on the Michelin app. You can use the app to read the brief descriptions.

Backtrack and go back near the entrance gate and then turn left to the Thai Hoa Palace.

Exit the palace and go north and then a little to the right to the Thái Bình Pavilion, also called The Emperor's reading room. This was my favorite place and there was a little garden / goldfish pond beside the building.

Exit the reading room and by now the heat is starting to come on strong and in my case I had seen the highlights and exited the Eastern Gate called Cửa Hiển Nhơn.

Do not go back to the gate you entered because you cannot exit there ....you have to exit at the Eastern Gate from what I understand. I made the mistake of thinking I could exit on the southern entrance gate and had to pay for it with another 10 or 15 minutes in the heat going back to the south gate and then turning around and going over to the East Gate to exit.

There's a Highlands coffee on the outside of the Eastern Gate to rest and enjoy a cold beverage or you can take a grab taxi or grab car back to your nice cool hotel room.

I'm a fan of really old architecture like the medieval castles and other buildings in Europe. Many of the buildings in the Citadel were damaged and have been rebuilt and from what I could tell most of the buildings from the 15 and 1600s dont exist ... but I did not research this long so do your own research. From what I could tell most of the Citadel structures were built in the last 200 years. I think the tombs on the outside of the city are even more recent. So if you are a fan of 402 1000 year old buildings you might be happy enough just covering the highlights. It depends on what do you find most interesting."
The citadel was a lot more impressive than I expected from the outside. There is lots to look at but having a guide was helpful as not a lot of signage around.
I saw it two years ago but went again now with some friends. It is a LOT of walking so be sure you don't go on a warm day!
"Make sure you come to the citadel and walk around the many different patios and buildings. it is not really crowded and even if it may appear like it, the place is so big that very easily you will find yourself in a courtyard with very few people.

The cost is about 150k dong and this is the kind of place it is worth to hire a guide because is so big and has so much history and so many buildings that otherwise you will just walk around without really appreciating or realizing where you are.

You will see pics about the battles that took place here during the war with the US in these very same buildings.

Must come here!"
"Try to go early as the heat of the day can be oppressive. It’s huge! There is a lot to see and a guide would be a good idea. The cost is $150,000 dong which is about $6.50 USD at today’s exchange."
"Amazing experience but a missed opportunity for something truely great. The Imperial City is an incredible experience however, has not been well maintained which detracts from its potential. A must see while in Hue, plan for at least half a day here. You will definitely need a hat, sun cream and lots of water as there is not much shade. The Citadel is huge, expect to do lots of walking so good comfortable shoes are a must."
"This was extremely impressive.
This massive citadel covers a massive area so allow a bit of time it took us 1.5-2hours and you could easily spend more time if you needed, we weren’t in a tour group and have seen other comments that it was a bit rushed so depends on your stay.
But regardless if you’re in hue this should be a definite visit"
"I'm a bit of a history buff so this ticked all the boxes for me. Stunning architecture, royal history and a bit of mystery thrown in. The citadel has lots of individual areas to walk through so I would allow at least a couple of hours. I was with a tourist group so unfortunately it was a bit rushed."
"Ok it not the same as the Forbidden city in Beijing but is still worth a visit. Best to get a guide we got ours from VM travel to get the best out of the visit and see place which you may miss if you got it alone. The site is spread out so be prepared for a fair bit of walking. It’s is amazing to think how this place would have been many years ago, some areas are fully renovated, other areas are being restored and other areas have been left to show you the damage the bombs created in the war. Make sure you try the Imperial tea and Imperial wine it’s an experience, but just checkout what goes into it.....eg starfish and sea horses as we didn’t and you did feel a bit uneasy from a ECO point of view. All in all a great way to capture the culture of Vietnam many years ago."
"The Imperial City is a monument of the Vietnamese culture, it's huge you need at least one day to do everything. Take the hat water with you. Small fees 150000 at the entrance. Rich well explains a peaceful place. I recommend !!"
"This is a real insight into the history of Vietnam. Make sure you get here early as it does get busy. The buildings and gardens transport you back to a time when Vietnam was mostly unknown to the West. We loved the photos of the last of the rulers and their court which brought the place to life. The bonsai trees in the gardens are amazing and to watch the gardeners prune and train them was so interesting.
The cost of the entrance is extremely reasonable and you could definitely stay for many hours as the whole site is huge. Plenty of places to get refreshments and the loos are clean too!
Don't miss out seeing this for yourself"
"We were very impressed with this complex. Few visitors seemed to make it as far as the imperial relaxation pavilions and stunning gardens deep inside the complex, which was great for us as we could enjoy them by ourselves, but they really missed out, Give yourself a full half day."
"The citadel is nice if you are interested in the history of Hue.
It’s a very large complex and you need a very good guide book or tour guide."
Oh wow I can not believe how great it is in the Citadel for a minute I thought I was in an Ancient Greek building. Clipped my toe off the wall and the security guard gave me a plaster! Not only that it is amazing to see but great service as well.
We had a lovely day out at Hue Imperial City. It's a great place to wander round for the day and take in the beautiful buildings. The exhibits aren't particularly exciting (and lots are very long!) but there is plenty to keep you interested for at least half a day anyway.
"a must see when visiting Hue. It's not overcrowded and you get a perfect impression of the life of the ancient emperors, even of that time when Vietnam become a French colony."
Interesting historical place but the literature is a bit sketchy. Nice gardens and parts are very quiet.
"Although this is a must see it is mostly impressive simply for its scale, comprising a huge number of buildings mostly in a similar style. Don't miss it, but don't give it priority over the Royal Tombs."
"Enjoyed the tour of the Imperial City and the local guide was again invaluable in painting the picture. The explanation of the history, the ying, the yang, 5 canons, 4 canons, earth, human and heaven and much much more..

Before and after photo’s during the American War were also interesting and the sight of the US bunker. I’m quickly learning that everything has a meaning here, from the number of claws the dragon has to the 5 points on the national flags yellow star.

Painstaking renovation and historical beauty. Well worth a visit but go early as the heat and the crowds increase."
"The big reason to visit Hue is the historic and ancient walled city across the perfume river. The area shows its age but has done well to survive and be restored after being a battle ground during the Vietnam War.

The various buildings and rooms vary in quality and detail. Some are quite elaborate and others quite bland to be brutally honest. There are a few exhibits and detailed info on the history and the goings on of the royal household to read. The small courtyard gardens look quite lovely and there is a lot to walk around and some nice photos to take. Add the usual gift shop and cafe as well as a bonus of a military vehicle museum on the way back to the coach park. Good but not the spectacle I was hoping for."
The citadel needs to be visited. It is in the heart of Hue and easily accessible. Allow a couple hours plus as this place is huge. There is a small entrance fee.
"The Citadel of Hue is very large, has a square shape, about 2.5 km each way. The total perimeter is nearly 11km. When visiting, it's easy to get lost. You need a guide to visit Hue Citadel. Entrance tickets to Imperial city + Forbidden Purple City is 150,000VND/person. The scenery is very beautiful. But it is very hot from April to August. You should prepare hats, umbrellas ... The works here are related to culture and history, so when visiting you should dress discreetly to show respect. Itinerary should go: Ngo Mon (Noon Gate) - Court - Thai Hoa Palace (Harmony Palace) - Chuong Duc Gate - Dien Tho Residence - Long Corridor - Thai Binh Pavilion - Ngoc Dich lake - Thieu Phuong royal garden - Royal Theater - Hien Nhon Gate."
"Beautiful buildings and a strong sense of history with evidence of the awful Vietnam war still to be seen, well worth a memorable look."
Interesting site and spreaded. A large portion was destroyed during thé war but there is still a lot to be viewed.
"We spent half a day here and that is more than enough time. It’s very crowded around the entrance but as you make your way through the complex, the crowds thin out due to the fact that the huge Korean and Chinese tour groups only do the main few buildings then move on with their city tours. I believe they miss out on some lovely sites towards the back of the complex which I enjoyed more (maybe because it was less crowded).
I understand that this was a major site during the Tet Offensive and was heavily bombed but restoration seems very slow and the grounds are poorly maintained. I would have liked to know more of the history but it is poorly sign posted and you don’t get a map as part of your entrance fee. In hindsight, we should have hired a guide but this is our mistake so I won’t hold it against the complex.
Overall, I think the Citadel is average and if you only have a day or two in Hue, some of the tombs such as Minh Mang, Khai Dinh and Tu Duc are much more rewarding to visit."
"My one regret regarding visit The Citadel is that we did not give it enough time. This former palace can take a few hours to explore.

Reasonably priced at VND150,000 per adult. Cheaper for children under 12.

Tip 1. Don’t try to include it in a visit to another attraction on the same day, as it can be very tiring.
Tip 2. Try to avoid when the sun is going to be high in the sky.... or carry an umbrella. There are few places to sit in the shade.
Tip 3. Bring toilet paper. You are unlikely to find any in the public toilets.

We ran out of time and were unable to see all of the site, but it has a lot of history within the walls of the Emperors Palace."
"We stopped specifically in Hue to visit The Citadel and it was absolutely the right thing to do. It is a vast complex which you can wander for hours with something new and interesting around every corner. Considering it’s in Vietnam there is a generous amount of signage in English which helps to put it all in perspective. It is a beautiful place, with ongoing restoration, and somewhere which is absolutely worth visiting."
"Not as extensive or fully restored as China’s Forbidden City the Hue Imperial City is every bit as impressive and interesting. I spent many hours walking and reflecting upon the many buildings and collections. Built in stages by royals in the 18th and 19th Centuries- and in use well into the 20th Century - some years of neglect along with serious damage during the French Indochinese war left a major project for Vietnam. The progress is remarkable.

I managed my trip to include a stop in Hue just to see the Imperial City and am very happy that I did."
This historic place is a must do when you are in Hue. The citadel is within easy walking distance from the main tourist area. Allow at least a couple of hours and try to avoid the midday heat.
"To tell the truth - we were disappointed. The Citadel is huge but it's a really oldschool museum. Very little explanation written in English, huge terrain with lots of empty places. Suitable for history lovers."
You either need a tour guide or read up on it. This place is big and it requires lots of walking. Visit the theater.
"Wow!! a must see if your in the area, we visited with a guide he was great we Learnt a lot highly recommended"
An interesting part of Vietnamese history and glad we went. We went on an organised tour from Da Nang and was ok day out. A bit long 10 hours round trip. I would recommend a tour with English speaking guide. It is a little similar to Forbidden City in Beijing in that it is very large. About 4sq km with 3 zones. It is a bit run down but the local government is starting to spend more money on restoration. The tour took us via Hi Van mountain pass on the way there. Amazing views but a bit winding and slow. The return is via freeway so quicker and includes an impressive 6.3km road tunnel through the mountains.
"We did not appreciate the size and complexity of the citadel. Even a day might not be longg enough. Wonderful history. Well documented. Signage to get you round the site could have been better.Plenty of independent tourists with their Vietnam guide books to keep them informed. Lots of spots for food, drink and souvenirs and to rest. The main reason for coming to Hue."
This place is just so special. Don't miss it!!! The ancient city is just breathtakingly gorgeous. You can easily spend 2hrs here admiring the ar architecture. I'd come back for sure
"This citadel is worth a visit. Vast . Carry enough water. Relax . Spend a day. The gates are majestic, so are the interiors, the photo galleries take you into the past.
There are so many aspects to it, each one different from the other.
The theatre, the gardens, the tiles and the broken ceramic art on walls and pillars all are majestic."
The Imperial City is quite large and takes at least half a day to visit. Lots of walking unless you opt for a car to take you around the site. During our visit the cicadas were in full roar and quite loud wich may bother some individuals! Take a hat @nd wear sunscreen. Stop off for an iced coffee and relax half way through. Don’t miss this sight!
"As an American being introduced Vietnamese history, I loved this site. We secured an english-speaking private guide easily, and spent about 2 hours exploring the throne room, grounds, and key buildings. There is a blend of history of Vietnam's last dynasty, the French colonization and occupation, and scarring from the 1968 battle during the American war. If you are in the area of Hue, this is a must."
Did someone ever heard about Hue Kingdom? Well we neither and this place was truly eye opening for us.
"I spent 3 hours walking around the city and it is certainly worth while. Architecture is lovely, history clearly displayed and also, signs of the Vietnamese / USA war still very visible. It was a poignant visit."
"Worth taking a look, great collection of old photos and documents on the walls. I dont know much about the history here but its always great seem old images of the people of those times"
"Although much of the citadel was destroyed by the American-Vietnamese fighting, a careful restoration project is bringing the site back to life. Some buildings are lost forever but you can still get a sense of the scale and magnitude of the site."
"The imperial city was a really cool trip and the buildings and court yards are very pretty and serene. The history is rich and the day we went it wasn’t too over crowded with tourists. Very pretty overall! It cost us 150,000 dong each to get in to if anyone is wondering."
"This is such a large & beautiful palace with garden and many building.
I highly recommend this to everyone who visit Hue."
"Upon entering one assumes that they will soon have completed the trip around the grounds. This is not so. Allow at least 4 hours for the visit, more if you want a snack and drink at one of the cafes dotted about the grounds. Do not miss the garden area in the furthest corner from the entrance. It has some nice planting and a wonderful peaceful feel. Well worth a visit and not expensive either."
"This is well worth a visit, short walk from town across the bridge. This place is amazing, there is so much to see. It's mind blowing how big the area is, its a shame that alot of it was destroyed but they have rebuilt so well. A must see attraction in Hue. There are toilets and a cafe inside so you can take a break."
"I think that Hue has a lot to offer, but I wouldn’t make the citadel a priority. It housed the royal family at some point in time so there are a lot of opulent displays of that for the time. It’s gigantic so be prepared to walk a lot and sweat, too."
Do yourself a favour high a guide and spend a couple of hours here. So much history. This citadel was bombed during the war and large parts of it are yet to be restored. It’s amazing to see how much wealth was here so many years ago. The emperors swimming pool was about the size of a football field and the bedroom was a maze of rooms much like a house. Must see if in Hue
"Last time we were here we were inundated with torrential rain, but loved our experience here. This time we were luckier and had good (warm) weather. It was great to explore and despite the very many busses parked outside, inside (because of the expansive grounds) didn’t seem too crowded.
Definitely download a self guided walking tour before you go. We could it useful and interesting knowing what we were looking at as we ambled about leisurely."
Well worth a visit and you really need to walk around it with a guide for all the history to come alive!
"The Imperial City sure is grand! There is much to see and you should dedicate a few hours to here. If you’re a photographer like me, I went outside of a tour so that I was not rushed and could meander around at my own leisure to take pictures as I please... but, I did miss out on the “history” part of the Citadel. For a simple visit, without such in depth photography, I would recommend a tour so that you don’t miss out on the historical part that I did. That’s my only regret."
"Hate to be pessimistic but this place is a must see in Hue but actually a bit boring in reality. There’s the odd picture of the old days on the walls but the admission doesn’t include any map or audio about the history. There’s no collections of implements or clothing they would have used and most of it is still in the run down state it’s been in for 40+ years since the war, although I heard they are slowly restoring it. Glad we went though."
"The site is an interesting part of the City's and Vietnam's history. Its worth including in a day tour and hearing the stories of the dynasties that have ruled over the centuries.
Its a very large site and lots of walking. Take water with you."
"We visited this on our first day and were absolutely blown away by how well kept the site is. The local community should be proud of the restoration they have achieved to many of the 19th century palaces and buildings.

If you're only in Hue for a few days then you should visit this place. Very peaceful and pretty. Just make sure you avoid the tours (unless you like big tours) and take the time to really explore the city. You can charge around in a few hours but you'll be sweating like a pig. We spent nearly 5 hours just exploring all the gardens, hidden buildings, lakes and ponds and we had a really relaxing and calm day.

And don't forget to follow the very clear signs and guidance that tell you to wear appropriate clothing. The security guards won't let you in some of the temples or palaces if you're wearing shorts or dresses above the knees, or shirts or tops that expose your shoulders."
"This was a pleasant surprise, beautiful walled old city. It’s undergoing restoration but you can see how it must have been."
"We really enjoyed visiting here, so much we spent 4 hours in total. If you are in Hue for a few days try to do it on your own, tours combining here with the tombs can barely brush the surface - they are in and out in about 90 minutes.
Away from the initial entrance you can be almost alone it is that vast, lots to discover and lovely gardens.
Bring a large bottle of water with you as gets very hot!"
Beautiful despite only 10 original buildings remaining out of 160. Restoration of the buildings being done with pictures showing previous buildings. The pictures alone are worth a visit as it depicts various aspects of the kingdom. Happily much of it in Vietnamese translated to English.
"There are a lot of nice spots for pictures. You need at least half a day inside if you want to take your time.
Around 4,45 pm people start going around with scooters to direct the visitors to the exits. By 5,30 you have to be out."
"Great day with two children, even our 3-year-old had a great time. Beautiful and tranquil place, feels like you are far from the city traffic. You can easily bring a stroller."
"A must do when in Hue. This place is enormous and to get the most out of it you need a guide. As you walk around you get to see the reconstruction work that has been carried out. The canals provide welcome cooling breezes. There is so much to see here as you work your way in. The rock garden with bonsai trees is beautiful, as is the lake. The theatre is beautiful and you have the opportunity to purchase tickets to watch a performance."
"Visiting the Citadel involves quite a lot of walking, but this is worthwhile. Lots to see in this old walled area."
"It is worth doing your research prior to going to the Citadel as there is so much to see and it is spread out over a huge area. No information leaflet or map given with tickets which might have helped.
Restrooms and eating facilities adequate."
This vast historic walled city was sadly badly damaged during the war but is being restored with UNESCO funding. One can still imagine what it was like as you walk around the restored parts of the citadel. Take time to visit the colourful craft centre just inside the exit gate .
"The Imperial city in Hue opens up for a long history of kings and emperors, their wifes and concubines. Much of it were destroyed during the American war. Parts of it are still ruins, parts were un-damaged and parts are reconstructed. You need a guide to give you the history so I recommend an organized tour which will give you some more high-lights of Hue."
Very pretty and picturesque complex. It’s so big there’s some quiet places which is nice with the number of tourists all over. The tombs are a bit more majestic and peaceful outside of the city but this is a must see nonetheless
"The Citadel was large and had so much history to explore, both relatively ancient and modern. It is well preserved and had great exhibits and buildings depicting what it may have been like at its peak. Definitely impressive and worth a visit when in Hue."
"When we drove past the Imperial City it looked impressive from the outside with the large outer walls and moat, it was even more impressive on the inside.
What a fabulous place to visit and it has a fascinating history. Unfortunately we were only able to visit here for one hour as it was part of a bus trip but I’m sure you could spend at least a full day here as it’s quite a big site.
They are still restoring the city after the damage caused by the war.
There are toilet facilities and a shop selling souvenirs, drinks etc on site.
If visiting Hue then this would be one of the places to visit."
"We spend at least 3-4 hours in citadel. Got a taxi from the hotel which was fairly cheap. We didn’t get a tour guide as we had a travel book/guide with us. It was great because we didn’t feel that we were rushed. We were able to walk around, sit down and embrace the views.
recommendations : sun cream is a must only if it is sunny, definitely bring a lot of water because it is very expensive to buy any beverages or food. Deet spray is a must as there are a lot of trees and insects. Also, toilets are pretty manky so have som tissues/wet wipes.
And MOST IMPORTANT - do not go out thought the exit gate if you haven’t finish the tour! There are guards sitting at the gates so they will make you to go all around the citadel towards the entry and buy a new ticket."
"The city of Hue was the ancient capital of Vietnam and the site of a massive and bloody battle during the Tet offensive during the 'American' war in Vietnam. Not surprisingly therefore that its ancient palace complex shows signs of war with bullet holes pappering the walls. Nevertheless, it's a must see tourist attraction on any tour of Vietnam. Get yourself a good tour guide to make your visit complete."
I enjoyed to sit several times to catch the beauty of the famous site. Take 2 extra hours the dream about how it might have been. The ambient is very much inspiring to do so. Unfortuneatly the gate was under renovation and to walk out was very remote
"Given its central location, we were fearful that it would be crowded with tourists like some of the other attractions in Hue. We went along with a guide early afternoon when it was hot enough to keep the numbers down. Furthermore, the site is large so that it was possible to find corners and angles to take photographs of the buildings and other items of interests without too many other tourists intruding into the shot. There are three concentric walls. Most of the central part was bombed to destruction during the American/Vietnam War, but there is nevertheless still lots to see inside The Citadel, including an interesting series of old black and white photographs."
"The main attraction in Hue. Located close to the river. Impressive series of buildings and you can easily spend 2 to 3 hours wandering around. There are plenty of great photo opportunities available.
No need to join a tour.
Like all things in Vietnam this is an inexpensive site, probably less than $3 in get in.
There are some cafes inside the grounds but they are relatively expensive, compared to waiting until you leave the citadel.
Plenty of toilet opportunities.
At some of the sites you need to remove your shoes and dress modestly.
Definitely a must see when in Hue."
"The Imperial city is the main attraction in the old capital city of Vietnam. Most of the city was destroyed in the Vietnam, US war, but it has been rebuilt/renovated recently and opened to Public, Located in the centre of the Hue city, the black, red and orange colors of the buildings is a feast to the eyes."
It is a must see in Hue. Most of the Citadel has been destroyed by war but it still an outstanding historical site. There is enough left for a great visit and to allow you to imagine the splendour that was once this royal enclave.
"Even though we were staying in Hoi An, we decided to take a day trip to the Ancient City of Hue via the Hai Van Pass. To say the Citadel is impressive is an understatement with its moat, thick walls, statues, artefacts, throne room and many buildings that still remain despite several invasions. Something you don't expect to see are tennis courts and a clubhouse."
"I fall in love with that place since day one. It s just beautiful. Passing under bridge to be in it is an amazing experience. You have the mix of old Citadel with so much green around, the contrast is pretty impressive and just natural. A place to Don t miss."
"When in Hue, one must visit The Citadel. Take your time, walk along the river to this location. Before you go, read about its history, and truly be astounded by the amount of turmoil this land has endured, clues are everywhere within this beautiful site. Spot the starfruit and longan trees..."
"Very much along the lines of the Forbidden City in Beijing, this palace, citadels area is expansive, steeped in history, ornamental, ornate, rebuilt in some areas and quite a long walk around. I think it is best to have a guide to help you understand what you are seeing and to explain the intricacies of Vietnamese history. The bonsais are amazing too. Worth a visit on a cooler or early time of the day"
"Great city, amazing history and views. Lots to see and do. Incredible architecture and great people in the area."
"If you know anything about the Vietnam war then you’ll know that US marines spent days fighting their way inside this place and you can see why. The massive surrounding walls, the moat, the complexity of the site and the defendable gates are still impressive and have largely ben restored. Restoration is ongoing and is being done with great sympathy. We were on something of a whistle stop tour but really you need at lest half a day to explore the citadel, imperial city, forbidden city , the four gates, the various temples, gardens and surroundings. It’s a beautiful place and well worth the trip."
"I m sure a visit to the citadel is important to any visitor.
Mine was spiced by a meeting with a veteran marine in Antigua in January. He fought here during the Tet offensive.
Walking the city was poignant as I’d been briefed about ascending degree of violence that was unleashed to retake the city . Starting from don’t damage anything to naval gunfire and air strikes to dislodge the vc."
"I really liked it, I went late in the afternoon and I think it was less busy and the sun was going down what made it special, nice colors.
You probably need 2h at least to visit, the place is huge!"
We had discovered recent war history in Cambodia and Ho Chin Minh City . We adored the history of trade in the merchants houses along the river in Hoi An . But we knew little of Vietnam’s imperial past and of it’s emperor dynasties which remained until the middle of this century . Our visit to the Citadel I. Hue answered all our questions and more . Beautiful relaxing and fascinating . Worth a visit .oh and the best pizza outside Italy at Risotto !
"A truly stunning place to visit, 10 square kilometres of culture. Allow plenty of time to visit as there is so much to see as you walk round. A “must do” if you go to Hue"
We visited without a guide and felt that there was insufficient information to really help us get a real feel for the place. Much of the site was destroyed in the battle in 1968 and an ongoing renovation is underway. I most enjoyed the garden area.
It has been a wonderful experience in the ancient city of Hue. The night market and the stroll is really a experience simply one can’t describe in words. The only regret is that we didn’t have more time there.
"This is one of the largest Citadels we have visited 3 villages were moved when it was created, don’t rush and soak up the history"
"This place is huge. Hard to comprehend how and why such a fortress was required back in 1806. But its here, moats and all. The labour and work required to build this , is hard to imagine. Truly a marvel"
"The Citadel and tombs in the area are very interesting, I suppose to folks like us interested in history. It is very helpful to have an accompanying guide.

Like most of Vietnam, there are no provisions for those with mobility issues.

There is a major emphasis on how the Americans destroyed most of the Citadel and some interesting revisionist history: the buildings that survived were lucky, as opposed to being spared by the Americans, despite their use by snipers."
We enjoyed wandering this huge complex and learning about its history. So much of it has been destroyed however they are slowly rebuilding. We loved seeing the many old photos which showed it in its original splendor. The gardens surrounding the library were absolutely stunning and it was a wonderful place to rest and cool down.
"This is the highlight of Hue city. Approachable on a bike within the city, it is one of the most gorgeous sites. Hue has a lot of history and this UNESCO heritage site is one of the first places to visit as you arrive."
"If visiting Hue a tour of the Citadel is a must! Although badly damaged during the Vietnam/American war the work being done to restore buildings is terrific. I kept being reminded in many ways of the Forbidden City in Beijing. Make sure you see the old photos of how it was before the war, the damage done during the war and compare to now."
"What an impressive complex! The scale of it just blows you away. It is over 200 years old and suffered extensive destruction during the wars, but is now a UNESCO heritage site and has undergone extensivel reconstruction. Nevertheless, it is quite a site, and it is hard not to be impressed by the scale of the place. A highlight of our trip!"
This place is full of history and so much to see. We did not pay for a tour but walked most of the 145 acre ancient citadel. Such a crazy story of all the back and forth between powers. Interesting.
Every turning is another wonder. Definitely not to be missed. We had a guide which was wonderful it made it come alive .
"Long ride from Danang to Hue to visit, but worth it. Reminded us a lot fo the Forbidden City in Beijing, but on a smaller scale. Electric carts can be rented to take you on a tour as the weather can be hot and humid."
"The are is huge! You will need whole day to explore everything within the imperial city. Should come earlier in the morning to avoid the heat and also a big group of tourists. The architecture is amazingThe ! Need to bring hat, sunglasses, good walking shoes, and nice breathable clothing."
You must see the citadel and the old palace. Plan a visit for about four hours to see al the highlights but also the less visited gardens and the reading pavilion. Very beautiful. The tour groups only visit the first buildings to take their selfies. The rest of the complex you can visit almost alone.
"We visited as part of our trip to the north of Vietnam. Interesting history under French colony and then destruction during the Vietnam War by the Americans. Much has been restored but even more has been lost.

What remains is well worth the trip."
"fabulous history, so many beautiful buildings and temples. It is huge and sprawling so do not get lost and lose your tour. you will stop to take a pic and they are gone without you. Also remember the location of the entrance you came through since different locations look the same. It is a huge maze. The buildings are all beautiful with extensive history."
"This is a not to be missed experience, exploring the expansive grounds of the Emperial City of ancient Vietnam. If you are interested in detailed history arrange for a guide to take you, but just spendering an afternoon exploring on your own is also a great experience. Don't miss the gardens and small lakes. There are beautiful places to sit and relax. I really wished I had taken my binoculars as there were many interesting birds."
"Make sure you allow enough time to get round, there is plenty to see and it is a good walk. Ample facilities inside but take some water, it gets hot."
"This is a must-visit in Hue. But remember to take your time. There are so ma y parts to explore and if you come early in the afternoon you can stay and watch the sun going down. You will even have some beautiful and remote places to yourself. There are shops in the area where you can buy water and snacks but it's expensive. If you want to save some money, bring some food and water."
A fascinating place to explore. Be prepared to spend a while and take plenty of water. As some suggest a guide to explain the history and events would be helpful. Still restoring parts of the buildings due to age and war damage.
"The Hue Citadel is definitely worth half a day visit. While I enjoyed the sights, I am taking off two stars for their ridiculous exit policy. The area where the royal family lived, called the purple royal city, is the most interesting part of the Imperial city. Many of the buildings have been restored after being in very poor condition after the Vietnamese American war. You can go into many buildings and there are hidden courtyards, gardens and pools throughout the area. Most interesting was the area for the queen mother, and its residence is the most restored and beautiful. The Citadel is a very Large area and can take some time to walk from site to site. WARNING: You cannot exit from the entrance. We had walked all the way back to the entrance to leave, and the Guards told us we couldn’t go out there (even though there was NOBODY coming in).They pointed to the far corner of the Citadel, and it took us literally 25 minutes to walk in the extreme heat to the official exit that is by the souvenirs shops. We then had to walk outside the walls all the way back to the main entrance that took another 25 minutes."
Lots of history but you need the right guide to explain it. Best done with a tour. Note: there are some steep steps and climbing. Not excessive but bears noting.
"This is one of the best sites I’ve visited in a long time! It’s on a huge site, and is breathtaking. It was severely damaged in the 1968 war, and has been carefully and sympathetically restored. The palaces, temples, pavilions, beautiful gardens, moats, lakes, lacquer work, old sepia photos... For me it is up there with any of the “greats” such as Pompei or Versailles! It’s on such a big scale, that it was never crowded. We were told the average length of time spent there was 2 hours. We easily passed 4 hours in this magical place, and could have stayed longer, if not for the heat.
Highly recommend, don’t miss it!"
"Spent a few hours walking around in the Imperial City, so much history. Well worth the 150 dong charge"
"Imposing layout of buildings on the site. Interesting architecture, some nice walks through the gardens. Beautifully decorated temples. In the morning would be best time to go."
"What a fabulously maintained venue. We walked through from one side to the other, it was so interesting and so well renovated."
"A must see when the city. Covers a vast area. We were only here for about 3 hours and could have spent longer. There a 3 sets of walls and in the centre the Forbidden City where there was an amazing wealth of history and stories to uncover.
Amazing place."
"The first thing we went in Hué and i'm sure I won't forget it ever!
They say 1:30h is enough, but is not... Take 3 hours at least, take your time to see every detail, every window, every rock... It is really stunning!"
It's quite big territory and interesting to see however quite dilapidated. Also ti's extremely touristy so better go there first thing in the morning to beat the crowd. It also can get very hot there at midday.
Wear comfortable shoes and prepare to walk into the past. The average museum is dwarfed by the size of this beautiful city. This is a must visit if in Hue.
"The site is huge, tons of garden space, however it is not well kept and the grass could do with being cut and the hedges taken back.
There are a few temples that you can go inside (as long as you are covered up), however, little English signs. As we had no tour guide, we were left wondering what each building was.
Entry was 150,000 per person, which is fairly reasonable.
Just make sure you have a vivid imagination as to what the ruins used to be."
We thoroughly enjoyed this visit with our guide he gave us lots of great information and explanation of all buildings renovation and glad to hear about the future restorations going to take place. Its grounds were very calming and serene imagining what it was like when the Emperor was there with his concubines! An absolute must to visit!
"Amazing site, so much to see, a must in Hue. Go early in the morning particularly at the weekend as it is a popular stop on the tourist bus tours."
See a part of the Imperial period of Vietnam. Part of the complex lost or badly demaged in the Vietnam War. Partly restored and reconstructed.
"Visit as early as possibly to beat the crowds. No need for a guide, just imagination as many buildings destroyed in American War"
"Must-see in Hue. The imperial city and citadel.
A bit rundown due to damages by wars
Not as impressive as those in China though."
"Has to be on everyone’s list of things to visit at some point . There is a lot to see so allow 3 or 4 hours to do it justice . Many people used the service of a guide and overhearing some of them I can see they add value but we chose to just stroll around at our own pace , read the literature on the walls and absorb the very positive vibe of the place . Thoroughly recommend"
This is the old capital of Vietnam. A large citadel surrounded by a moat. It is in the process of being rebuilt in certain areas. A good way to spend a morning looking around the grounds. Cover your shoulders and knees to get into the tombs.
"This place is absolutely
Incredable! It was built in 1804 to about 1831. Chinese architecture. It was abandoned and damaged by the wars... It is an absolutely huge area and it is a must see!
Be careful of uneven ground and steps. Not a place for children or wheelchairs. Must be walked."
"The details on several of the existing structures is very beautiful, but sadly many of the buildings have been long since destroyed or are in need of extensive restoration. The area is large so it's best to plan the buildings you wish to visit."
Had a lovely morning wandering around the palaces temples and gardens. Great value for money. Cafe inside and shops also reasonable.
"The Imperial palce was good although lacked information at points

If you want to see the other Tombs when at the ticket office by a multiple ticket it's gives you entry to 4 Royal locations costing 360000 vnd
Then grab a motorbike or an easy rider to take you and enjoy the countryside

The Palace often has evens and shows at night and is open un 10pm I only found this out once I was inside in the early morning."
"I wandered around for a few hours taking in the city. A very interesting way to spend an afternoon. There are dozens of buildings to see, some interesting photographs of early rulers."
Very good but I didn't like that it was almost totally reconstructed. It's too large you need a lot of time to visit it
"Pros
- Vast grounds to explore. Could easily spend a few hours here

- Buy the combo ticket only if you're planning on also visiting the tombs (which are a bit further out).

- Buy any drinks or snacks etc that you want outside of the citadel. There are some very cheap restaurants, stalls and small shop just before you go in. We didn't see anywhere selling drinks/snacks inside.

- There's a map just as you enter. It could be a good idea to take a photo of it so you know roughly where you're heading inside the citadel. It is very large!

Cons
- Very large tourist groups come here but the grounds are vast so they are easily avoidable. Lots of gardens and smaller temples to turn into if a large group come your way.

- The electric cars were quite expensive. (I can't remember exactly how much). However, they're not strictly necessary to get around. Unless you have mobility problems or want to avoid the sun, I think it is really lovely just to walk around everywhere and explore!"
"My son and I visited this cite and were very impressed by it. The last time I saw it it was in the Vietnam war and of course it was very much in need of repair. Most of it has been repaired and the visit was very informative.
I truly enjoyed myself."
There is not so much to do in Hue. But visiting the Citadel is a must do! It’s beautiful restored and you can easily walk for hours. Come early!
This is a great place to visit in Hue to learn about history and culture of Vietnam. We were here on tour and the guide explained a lot to us about every things. A must visit in Hue.
"Well worth visiting for a minimum of 2 hours, longer if you have time, this citadel is quite large, some 10 000 metres square, and was built between 1805 and 1832. It contains the remaining buildings that formed the palace of the last of Vietnam’s royal families, the Nguyen dynasty, and there are models of what the original site would have looked like in it’s heyday when Hue was the capital of Vietnam. Some of the buildings are being restored following damage from the Tet offensive in 1968, but fortunately there are still some colourfully decorative sections to see. It was also not busy whilst we were there (during the middle of the day), maybe because it was quite hot then - you need to take a hat as it is quite open To the sun in places. However there was a cafe selling drinks ,snacks and ice creams. There were also some souvenir shops. There is an entrance fee , but also various package options allowing you to combine a visit here with visits to some of the nearby tombs."
Beautiful place. There is a lot destroyed in the Vietnam War but there is more than enough to see. New reconstructions are coming.
"The citadel is an amazing place, but in the process of being restored. What has been restored is simply stunning. One can easily imagine the splendor and luxury in which the Nguyen emperors lived. When all the work is completed, the citadel will be spectacular. However, even now, it’s still a definite must!"
"Big Imperial compound, and it´s incredible how the nice Vietnamese people restored already several buildings of the Palace (how it was possible to had a man to man battle at the compounds in the Vietnam war???)"
"This is an absolute ‘must see’ if you visit Hue.
We visited in a group of 10 as part of a Hue City Tour, and I was very impressed by the sheer scale of the site. It is surrounded by a moat.
It was an extremely hot day when we visited. However there are plenty of shady areas to seek escape from the sun. It is a fascinating citadel which is still undergoing refurbishment following the American War."
It was a hot day but there were plenty of places to buy cold water and the WC's are clean.. Parts of it are still under renovation from the war.
"I have really enjoyed the visit of the citadel. I strongly suggest to get there at 7AM when it opens as, when I went, there was absolutely no-one! I could enjoy the first couple of hours in almost complete silence. If you want to have a nice stroll and look it all, can easily take half a day."
"This is an excellent trip. The entry is 150,000 dong per person and well worth it. We wandered around by ourselves, however it would be better to have a guide to explain its history. Take water with you if it's hot, although there are places inside to get drinks and snacks. A great visit."
Spent a few hours at the Citadel with our guide. Fascinating place with plenty of notice boards if not with a guide.
"One can only imagine what this Palace must have been like when it was in its glory. Such a shame that large parts have been destroyed.
It is an amazing place to visit, a must for when you are in Hue"
"So much history here, walking through each block to re-live and picture everyday’a life during the imperial days. I enjoyed it very much!"
Nice to walk through and read about the history. Unfortunately war claimed most of the old buildings but they are rebuilding. The theatre is a must see!
"Spent about 3 hours touring this site and its various temples and gardens etc, lots of interesting history of the city and old photos of the Emperors and their family. There were places to stop for a quick drink and toilets too. A large complex but a must see in Hue."
The palaces cool and Interesting there is some explaining of the history in English. Some of the grounds are not fully restored yet. you can’t see everything because it’s blocked off but there is a lot of history when you walk around the whole palace explaining pictures and writing
"You re going to hue, mainly for this visit. Take your time (4hr), and look at all the details. The story of the 13 kings is so amazing.
The buildings are so amazing.
If interested i would suggest that you read some book of vietnam history before your visit."
The architecture here was nice and had a great feel of rich history to it. I expected it to be closed in more than it was. I think it would be best to rent a scooter of bicycle and explore at your own pace. We used a cyclo driver but still felt like we missed too much. Its worth a visit if in Hue.
Unlike the forbidden city in China which was memorable the Imperial Citadel and the Forbidden Purple City are interesting but not a visit I will remember. The original buildings are long gone and are being recreated on the original foundations. A great effort by the Vietnamese government and UNESCO.
"My wife and Only had a couple hours and thought to explore the Citadel and then visit the tombs and pagoda’s the next day. It worked out well. One could spend all day at the Citadel but 2 hours was good, 3 would have been also good but tiring. Lots of steps and walking. Interesting ruins."
The Imperial City is the anchor to the sites in Hué. It’s architecture is splendid and walking around the campus is a charm. Highly recommended.
"Not a lot to see, it is being restored very slowly, however it will take some time. It’s a place to escape the bustle of the city."
The citadel and imperial city was amazing and exceeded my expectations. So ornate like being back in time.
Our knowledgeable guide was passionate in relating the history surrounding the Imperial City. Deeply appreciated the nuances and indepth info shared.
This is a massive and interesting historical site with the Imperial City inside. To get the most out of it you should have a guide to explain the history and restoration. It takes a bit of walking but it is flat (with some stairs) and just beautiful. The history of the French occupation and Tet offensive that took place here makes it a must see for Hue.
"We spent a morning strolling round the citadel . Thoroughly enjoyed it. It exceeded my expectation as I thought it would be ruins but not the case. Many parts have been restored.

Enjoyed the photographs of the Emperors. Many were on tours but we were happy to stroll ourselves"
"The imperial citadel provides an amazing trip into the past. Though most of the original buildings were destroyed during multiple wars, some key buildings were reconstructed and renovated to give a good impression of the past. Good curated exhibitions with old pictures further enhance the experience. Reserve half a day for this site."
"We went without a guide for a wander around the Imperial City, it’s impressive and a nice ground, but probably much better with a guide to know more about its history.

+ free rice wine tasting at the souvenir shop (just ask for it)"
I had goosebumps when I walked into the big temple. You are walking into a huge room with a lot of offerings/gifts to the dead.The carvings and golden details are amazing. The royal garden is breathtaking and you are able to buy fish food and give it to the huge Koi fish. We used around 4-5 hours including lunch.
Historic Landmark. Many reminants of the time when the king lived here. There was even a traditional Vietnamese band that played! Highly recommended!
It's worth a visit to make a trip to the citadel. I spent at least 4 hours soaking in the architectural and history of Hue. Take your time and go back in time and learn about the emperors and history of Vietnam. It's not as majestic as the Forbidden city in Beijing. It is charming and nostalgic in its own way.
"The Citadel has a lot of things going on. There is a massive palace and many other buildings. The architecture is extremely interesting and the history behind it is also very fascinating.

Be aware: you are in for a lot of walking. The grounds are huge.

Also - constructive criticism - the grounds could do with some better upkeep i.e.: loose stones and grass being far too long in certain areas."
Visited as part of a tour. I found it slightly ‘run down’ in places but nonetheless very interesting to visit and pleased to have experienced it. Plenty to see but probably best with guide to explain the functions of the various buildings.
"The Citadel is a palace within a fortress and really worth a visit .
Beautiful temple and extensive gardens."
"It is easy to spend a few hours wandering this important historical site. Even without a guide, I found it fascinating reading about its history and those who lived there.

Considering the population in Vietnam and the number of people who appear to be out of work in Hue, it occurred to me that the government would do well to employ a few gardeners. The lawns were overgrown, garden beds needed weeding and tending. How much more aesthetically pleasing the Forbidden city would be is the garden were a little more manicured."
"It was pouring with rain when we visited but it did not marr the visit. It lovely to walk around, it is laden with history and restoration is being done. It is a shame that so much damage was caused during the war. I would say it is a place to visit if in Hue as if it gives you an insight to the city"
"It was an interesting tour, learning the history and seeing the sights. We saw the buddest monks praying and the very young boys who have become monks. Some were so very young. We were told that they may be orphans or some may have got on the wrong side of the law. I felt sorry, for some, who I felt could do with a mother's love and cuddle."
"Complete anticlimax... the reviews suggesting that the gardens are stunning are complete liars. the gardens are not kept well at all. The grass is dry and overgrown, very few colourful plants.

As for the Citadel itself its mostly in ruins however there were some nice areas.. despite this, we felt it would have been useful to have some information signs to make sense of it all. Guides are available at an extra cost. I can understand its appeal to enthusiasts but for me it just didn't cut the meat

what ticked me off the most was the feeding pond. Pay 5000 dong to feed the fish (great) however the pond was literally full of the same plastic bags the fish food came in... whats wrong with people! If there isnt a bin available take the rubbish with you!!

We cannot understand why the (quite pricey) entrance fee is not being used to maintain the grounds."
"This is a fascinating site that gives an informative insight into Vietnamese history. It was very busy when we visited, which detracts somewhat from the enjoyment, but it is an important site that should be visited."
"We visited the city and citadel in February. Weather was great. The place itself is spectacular, worth every second spent inside. Must see in Hue.!"
"We were very excited to visit the Imperial City of Hue, as we love history and architecture, and we had heard many good things about it. However, it was fairly expensive to get in, and pretty underwhelming inside. There were a few very pretty gates, but other than that basically everything else was so-so. If you've seen temples in Southeast Asia before, you're not really getting anything new or different here.

It didn't seem well-maintained at all, especially considering how much money they're making on entrance fees. Also, there was a craft-looking area and museum around the treasury building, which looked fun, but it was closed (we assumed for Tet, but looks like it has been closed for a while).

This might just be our experience as we have already been to see a ton of amazing temples throughout Thailand and Cambodia (including Angkor), so we were a bit underwhelmed and uninspired. If there was more care put into properly restoring it, then it could really be something special."
"The citadel has so much to see.
A part of it has been destroyed but it’s still a beautiful sight.
Take lots of water too.
There are many places to visit."
"one of the highlights of Hue. has some cool spots to see inside. u need to buy a ticket to get inside. u need to walk from the ingate to see it. the big square infront of is also very cool. near the entry gate u may sace few scams, try to avoid. must see if u love history and herritage. very impressive one."
"For the whole experience is so enjoyable. As it was built like the one in Peijing, if you do not travel to China. It is good to walk around here. History for the last king of Vietnam which you can learn a bit from the exhibition inside there. The entrance fee is Dong 150,000. And it takes you around 2 - 3 hours to walk around. Prepare a comfortable shoes with you."
"Worth the stop in Hue to see this magnificent site. Leave about 2 hours for the tour. I have seen palaces in Beijing, Seoul and Bangkok, but they can’t be compared to the size and beauty of this imperial city."
"This place is huge and well worth a visit. Lovely gardens, ponds and history. Loved the fish feeding too."
Amazing place to visit and get some idea of the culture. Also you can still see the senseless destructive power of war. Highly recommended.
"Travelled by train from Da Nang to visit the Imperial City. The journey traverses the Hai Van Pass and takes 2hr 50 on a good day.

Was it worth it? Absolutely a master class in ancient culture and truly stunning gardens to boot. The Imperial City is large with expansive gardens. There are spectacular bonsai tree displays everywhere too.

The buildings are awe inspiring, nestled in the gardens with water a feature throughout the city grounds. A mere 5 €/£s entry and worth every penny.

A day out from Da Nang with scenic train ride to boot. A must when in Vietnam. I was fortuitous enough to visit just before Tet and had the whole place to myself. Lucky me."
"My best advice is to do this attraction with a guide as it covers a huge area and you are not given any information when you enter. There aren’t any maps available and although there is signage in English it is still confusing as to where to go. We accidentally stumbled upon the best parts of the complex. The Imperial City is slowly being restored from all the damage suffered during two wars. One area that was recently finished is the King’s Gardens - absolutely stunning. Well worth the visit, so much so that we returned the second day on a tour!"
I’m not much of a history buff so I felt a bit lost. Lots to read about and old buildings have been redone. Toured around for more than an hour. Nice walk but 150k per person to walk around might be too much.
"There are two ways to approach the Citadel: as an historic former capital of Vietnam or as the site of a key battle that launched the Tet Offensive, which many regard as the point at which the Americans realized that there would be no ""winning"" of the Vietnam War. If it is the latter, read the book ""Hue 1968"" to gain an understanding of what happened here. Up to that point, Hue and the Citadel had been spared the destruction of the war. Miscalculations on all sides lead to the near total destruction of the Citadel. Thanks to UNESCO, you can now see what it once liiked like."
"You can actually see most of the pagodas by walking around the outside anyway. I think 150,000 dong is far too much to pay for an entrance to a place that looks like many others in Vietnam, especially when Hue doesn't have much else to offer.
Just to a lap of the outside and you'll get the idea."
"The title says it all, and this place doesnt dissapoint. Well depends if you like this kind of stuff or not, if you don’t then you should visit this place. This place i noticed was “perserved” as much as possible. Its sad how over 100 buildings/structures was burned down or damaged. What is left is beautiful, and it tells a story. If these walls could talk i would sit for days to hear how each king/emperor ruled vietnam. Its great to see artifacts on displayed (well not much but whats left after the distruction). I personally think this place COULD USE MORE attention and TLC, how amazing to perserve, and then teach/ show the history and sharing it with the younger generations. The areas where buildings used to be are filled with grass fields which could be cut for a better manicure experience. Anyways, there really isnt much to do in this town except to learn about the history. This place is a must!!! oh bring some sunscreen and a hat or umbrella, you’ll need it."
"Very nice place to stroll around for half a day. There are a wonderful mix of architecture on the sites - some well preserved, some in the process of being restored and some seemingly being left.

Given the large number of tour groups, it can be surprisingly tranquil once you get past the main gate and head further back to really explore the sites undisturbed from the coach parties."
A must visit if you are in Hue. The Citadel has so much history I strongly suggest visitors to go with a guide so you can truly appreciate the significance of the Imperial City.
Wonderful journey back in time at the Imperial City. Currently going through renovations. A bit over grown in places but well worth a visit.
"We spent 3 hours doing a self guided tour of the citadel (see picture/map) seeing all the main attractions. There wasn't as many people around as we thought there would be, a rain scares them off, it was enjoyable waking around seeing all the sites, so glad we had a plan and google maps, (the blue dot is our friend). This and the tombs was the reason we came to Hue, it did not disappoint.

Hint, a good idea not to wear shoes and socks as there are quite a few temples to visit, so you will be taking them off and on a bit, good excuse to wear, thongs/jandals/flip-flops/birkies.

Note: when visiting the Imperial City and monuments, we highly recommend getting combo tickets, referred to on the signs as “Package tour tickets”. We purchased 4 site route, which includes, Hue Royal Palaces (Citadel), Minh Mang, Khai Dinh and Tu Duc royal tombs, which can be purchased at your first site, for 360,000vn (see picture)."
"The Citadel in Hue displays the imperial epoch of the Vietnamese history. There are some renovated buildings, some ruins and some parts currently under reconstruction.
However the place is really worth of visiting. The gardens, temples and buildings are beautiful even for a walk around if you are not much into history."
"Bad news for people who are not able to walk a whole lot to see tombs and empty buildings.

Our otherwise excellent hotel car driver and ""guides"" at the Citadel all assured us, three septuagenarians, that electric cars were available to tour the Citadel.

We were eager to pay the fee and even offered to pay more than other people, but were informed by the concessionaire at the Citadel that ALL the electric cars had been reserved by Korean groups.

We were told that one must book the electric cars 2-3 days in advance to ensure that one is available for you.

Otherwise all the electric cars are reserved by Korean tour groups and none are available for other visitors.

Thus, I shall not recommend anyone going to see the Citadel and tombs of Hue ever again.

If you want to reserve an electric car to view the Citadel, ask your hotel to book one for you IN ADVANCE."
"Spent the better part of the day walking around the huge complex full of beautiful buildings and gardens. Absolutely beautiful and mesmerizing.
Explore the the grounds to find all the cool corners and beautiful sights."
"The citadel is probably one of the must sees in Hue. It’s a huge and impressive complex, and presents very interesting information from Vietnam’s rich history. Much of the complex is a undergoing restauration since the days where much of it was destroyed after the war.

Its so large that you can lose yourself into the complex. We wished there was a little better information on what to see in the complex, like a recommended path of the visit."
I booked a full day city tour and I’m glad I did. There’s much walking involved and many steps to climb.
"The imperial citadel gives an understanding of the political activities, royal ceremonies, rituals and a daily life of the Nguyen Dynasty emperors (1802 – 1945). It covers around 36 hectares, so allow at least half a day for visiting (a day if see everything).
Emperors’ residence and their working space is at the central area, at so called “Forbidden purple city” which is 9 hectares itself.
Lots of beautiful architectural sites, temples, palaces, gates, and much more of the emperors’ lifestyle…
There are restaurants/ cafes inside the Citadel as well as souvenir shops. An audio guide is not available. We were not offered a brochure neither a map so if it’s your case as well, make sure you take photos of the maps displayed on your way for not missing a hidden topics/sites of your interest."
"Hue is the historic heart of Vietnam and where the emperor lived both before and during the colonial period. The citadel is constructed to withstain attacks with the Perfume River forming one of the protected sides.
We visited on a rainy, cloudy day and there was a kind of romance to the misty environment. It is certainly worth seeing if you are in Hue, but I did not find it to be that engrossing. The large courtyards and buildings are lovely. I actually found that the deeper we went into the compound, the more minimal and more beautiful the site became. Broken china was used to create much of the ""tile work"". And this is quirky and interesting. You can sometimes see a whole teacup being used to create fanciful animals as part of the decoration. The prize possessions of the Citadel are antique brass water jugs that stand in one of the inner courtyards. These are beautiful, old and considered national treasures."
"The royal residences inside the Citadel and Forbidden City are impressive. Recommend combining this stop with a tour of the royal tombs outside Hue to get a sense of the Imperial families that ruled Vietnam through the early 20th century. Hue was ground zero for some of the fiercest urban fighting during the Tet offensive in 1968, where most of the City (including the Citadel) was heavily damaged. Much of the Citadel has been restored to it’s original glory, and it is beautiful."
We booked the tour at our hotel Sereen Shining Hotel whom provided an excellent guide for the day. Including the Citadel and a dragon boat ride at the end. Highly recommend.
A lot of walking & many tourists. The exhibits & structure with very old Chinese wordings. The entrance guards (local Vietnamese were very rude with no initiative or feasible and can't speak English.
"an interesting place to visit, I prefer a guide to better understand the history of this place, beautiful gardens"
A visit to the Citadel is a must for all those who are inerested in Vietnamese history and culture. So much to see.
"What a place! You just can imagine how life was earlier in there. The area is huge and everywhere you can see details of handwork and color of cold and purple. The place made me speechless.
-Tero-"
We had a guided tour here: thank to the guide we could better understand the history behind this huge imperial complex. Beautiful gardens too.
"A great experience in this wonder of history helps if you have a great tour guide: Hoa was amazing
Unfortunately the weather could have been better, it was raining the whole day but it did not dampen the experience."
"We are spending one day Hue with a lot of destination for visit, you should visit Hue when you are in Vietnam, with history, culture, and religios.
Highly recomended."
"The large forbidden city is impressive, and required lots of restoration due to war damage. Some of the destroyed buildings were never rebuilt....a lot of ornate work, some Chinese influence as well.
The theater inside is really beautiful!
A must see."
"Johnny Le is a Great driver
Knowing, carting, useful tips and locational information. Made a long 3 hour trip from Hoi An to Hue stopping all the way up at great locations like My San World Heritage site... beat the tourist crowd and had the area to ourselves until we returned to vehicle and hundreds of other tourists.
Ask for Johnny Le by name as they have many good drivers. VM Travel"
This is a must do in Hue. It is simply stunning with a mixture of destroyed and decaying and restored buildings. Great info and a wonderful way to spend a few hours....the place is massive!
"If you want to get a view of the old dynasties of Vietnam, this is definitely the place to do it.
The scale of the city is impressive in itself and combine that with the architecture, the scale of the construction and the recent history of conflict around the Citadel, it is a real treat for history buffs.
Although the complex was extensively damaged during the Vietnam conflict in the late 1960s, a good number of the buildings have been restored or rebuilt to reflect their past glory. The site is spread over quite a large area, so you will need a little stamina to get around, unless you want to use one of the electric vehicles that will transport you within the walls."
Such a shame that this was so damaged during the war. Currently under restoration that will probably take a long time but will be stunning when finished.
We were blown away by the beauty of the entire site. Considering so much damage had been done by successive there is much still to see and it takes several hours. It is some distance from most of the accommodation and so expect a long walk and sore feet
"I found this place to be very open about its history which is immense. The size of the works carried out in construction is enormous when you know how this would be done today. The assistance of a knowledgable tour guide did help. The impact of the war in the late 60's is disappointing but there is a project to restore to the previous condition.

Excellent historical site"
"We went to the Hue Imperial City as part of a group tour. Prior to the trip, I was completely unaware of the Nguyen Dynasty of Vietnam.

Firstly, the Imperial City was badly damaged in the Vietnamese war, most of the buildings were in ruins and the Vietnamese have embarked on re-building the Imperial City.

There are still many visible bullet holes in the walls that remain. There are sections that have been re-built and refurbished. What you will find is that the Chinese influences are very strong, from the architecture to the bronze ""ding"" / cauldrons. I was surprised that even the inscriptions on the pillars and walls are in Chinese. The citadel itself is not very old, less than 300 years.

I am glad that I came here before they rebuilt the place. It feels more authentic even though more than 75% of the place was destroyed.

Definitely worth a visit if you are in Hue."
"Definitely get a local to take you round, we had a guy with his bike, he took us to places we would never have found. The memorial house to President Ho Chi Minh (Free entry). Kings House (Free entry). Timh Tam Kim (Free entry) this place was stunning, beautiful, peaceful, here they sold lots of jewellery but you don’t have to buy. He then took us to the Royal Palace and waited for us at the exit. We had the guide for 2 hrs, he spoke excellent English and because he lives in the Citadel he told us a lot about its history. Well worth the 40million dong!"
We toured the The Imperial City of Hue as part of the Hue city tour. It was very beautiful and informative.
a big place that you can easily spend a day here if you are so inclined. some newly restored buildings and some in the process of being redone. big grounds some in good maintained order and some not so much. lots of derelict buildings. walkways are slippery when wet be warned. a few cafes to have a tea and take a break. while worth the visit.
Was an interesting experience and although it was pouring we stayed quite dry due to all the covered passages. Would recommend taking a rain poncho or umbrella nevertheless
"We arrived on a very wet day and as this is an outside site we got very wet walking around. Having said that, the site was worth visiting and the buildings and ceramic mosaics were superb"
"Background: The Citadel was constructed around 1804 for Emperor Gia Long. The whole complex is located alongside the ‘Perfume river’ inside a first wall that’s about 10km long. The Royal Citadel has ten ornate gates guarding the palace, temples, gardens and tombs. The main entrance is The Noon Gate, sized for elephants! but only to be used by the king. The Citadel is surrounded by moats and the scenery is very photogenic.Walk towards the back of the palace and enter through a second wall into the Imperial City (or the Forbidden Purple City). This area was exclusively for the Emperor’s personal use.

Although busy, the grounds are so extensive it's easy to avoid the crowds except when visitng the main areas and walking in/out of the beautiful gates. We spent a couple of hours at the Citadel as part of our guided tour of Hue (reviewed separately), but I would have liked longer and could easily have spent another couple of hours here as so much to see, but we ran out of time. The gardens are extensive and really lovely, and so many picturesque buildings to explore too, I probably could easily have spent a full day here!

Recommend to spend upwards of 3 hours here and to visit with a guide, as ours contributed so much to the experience. I read 'A bundle ticket for the Citadel and the tombs of Khai Dinh, Tu Duc and Minh Mang can be bought for 360,000VND (£12).', however our tour included the cost of all our tickets."
"With my girlfriend we arrived to Hué in the morning, and left for the citadel. I’m a history nerd and just loved it. Although it was raining it didn’t dampen our experience"
"We spent several hours walking around the Imperial City. Every doorway seemed to reveal a new delight. We relaxed in the bonsai garden , while enjoying refreshments. Later we listened to traditional music in front of the To Mieu Temple. Overall, it was a lovely afternoon."
"What a marvellous place this is. Wonderful history and great detail in the buildings, with much repair and renovation already completed. What a shame the americans saw fit to nearly destroy it."
We had a great 2 hour private tour with Miss Van. The Citadel was very interesting and full of information about the Imperial empire. A good place to visit in Hue.
I’m a teenager who enjoy visiting historical places. The Citadel satisfied my interest. I hired a tour guide with the price of 150.000 VND but I think it was worth it.
Well worth a visit. Fairly cheap to get in. But I enjoyed walking around at night the best. The illuminations beautiful.
Mix of restored and in progress buildings - exhibits include before and after photos as well as a scaled model of the original.
"I was so looking forward to this place, and I wish we knew then what we know now!

1: Wait for the tour buses to pass though and hit the gate at 11am.

Not 10am, not 9am, and definitely not 8am (it's just chaos!) If you down't want to fight the crowds, then pick your time carefully. As I have heard all through my life, timing is everything, and the citadel is no exception.

My wife and I decided to have a bit of a leisurely start to the day and arrived at the gate about 10am after a monstrous breakfast and a cruisey layin. Most guide books will tell you earlier is best but I would have to disagree.

Up to 10am all of the tour buses and hordes of tourists descend on the main gate 10 deep, pushing each other out of the way to get in first. However, by 11am, you could easily walk right through the main gate without bumping into anyone! My top tip... wait for the crowds to pass through...

2: You don't need to allow a whole day when just a few hours will do.

Now this place is big, but not so big you need a whole day to wander around. Allow yourself 3 hours to adequately see the temples, buildings and gardens (of which there are many). The place is beautiful in parts, heartbreaking in others and just plain interesting overall, but you wont need to linger in one place too long, so move along and take it all in at a pace that works for you.

My favourite parts seemed to be in the furtherest most corners, as there were WAY less people, and was much quieter. Almost blissful in fact!

3: Bring plenty to drink

You will be hard pressed to find much in the way of refreshments for sale, and we only found one place that did cold drinks and teas, so bring plenty to drink as it is HOT HOT HOT with not that much shade other than some trees off the main paths.

4: Bring cash

On the subject of buying things, this place does seem to work in cash, so credit cards are a no no.

5: Best photo opportunities

Finally... travel light. I had cameras and all sorts with me and in the heat it is just tiring. My mistake is your advance warning. If you intend dragging a big camera through the place then strip it down to the bare minimum. One camera body and a 24mm lens with maybe a 50mm as a second lens is all you need.

The best picture from the outside is from the right of the main entry gate looking across the moat. 24mm lens for this, with some foreground trees and lots of beautiful blue sky, and inside there are pictures everywhere. Use your 50mm for this to eliminate as many other tourists as possible...

There is so much legacy here and so much to read, see and imagine. From thousands of years of royal reign to more recent battles between US and NVA there is evidence of history everywhere. Don't miss it, but use these tips as a basis to plan your day.

Enjoy.... we sure did"
A stark realisation of the reality of war can be seen here. Pay extra for a guide though as it is a huge place and the stories help a lot
"I walked around on my own, and there were some interesting areas, unfortunately the best bits were bombed to pieces in the Vietnam war, so the it was difficult to envisage what it would really have been like in its prime"
"Don’t leave Hue without visiting The Citadel, it’s magnificent! You need at three hours to appreciate the beauty and enjoy your time."
"The citadel, imperial city, and the forbidden city sight is enormous. Enter off the riverside and hire a guide (not expensive and totally worth it). Quite a history from long, long ago...unfortunately, The site is still in process of renovation, with quite a bit to go. If rainy, walkways are slick."
"Lovely place to visit, lots to see and good way to spend an afternoon! Easy to walk to, we didn’t get a tour as like walking around places at our own pace. Lots of places to eat and drink on the way around. Enjoyed feeding the fish."
Although interesting there was nothing immersive that would bring you back. Maintenance and restoration work seemed to be done to a very tight budget which is disappointing considering the cultural significance of the Citadel. Would suggest going on a tour to get a better insight into the history.
We enjoyed. This is the UNESCO world heritage spot . My favourite sight so far in Vietnam. A must to visit when you are in Hue
"Sadly much of this was bombed during the ‘American’ War, tough that would happen, War is Hell. Nice that they’re doing a fine job with the reconstruction, it’s a sweet spot in Hue."
"Take your time and wander the vast grounds of the citadel. A small entrance fee of 150,000VND adult, allows you as much time as you wish to view the ancient city grounds and buildings. Plenty of spots to sit and rest by the water or under cover allow for a relaxing visit. Information lines the buildings. Amply toilets are available as are refreshments from vending machines and stores. Enjoy your visit."
We enjoyed visiting the Citadel and wandering around the various palaces and temples in various states of repair. The restored ones are amazing. We cycled there and left our bicycles near the entrance with an attendant ($1).
The Imperial Citadel is fascinating and worth visiting. So much to see and relaxing to walk around without having to dodge motorbikes and cars
"My friends and I are at a loss as to why so many travellers miss out on Hue. Most of the reason it is so incredible is The Imperial City (Citadel). They produced some of the best photos and memories on our trip. Though only 10 / 160 original buildings remain, those that do are impressive and feature informative exhibits. Restorations are underway with the government and locals keen to protect this amazing attraction from further destruction. Highly recommended to history, architecture and culture buffs."
"I sound like a philistine saying that, but the citadel is very impressive in scale but theres not much to do there. Wandering through the gardens is nice, as is seeing the theatre. They used to perform at the theatre but no longer do, which makes it a little more dull.

Go to say you went, but temper your expectations."
"It looks like the forbidden city in Bejing and that is not strange for the Chinese where ruling here in the past. THey are realy hard at work to restore the damage done by war.
lovely to see the details in the woodcarvings etc."
"This is an amazing place full of history.

You will need at least 3 hours to see all the grounds- we were lucky to have a local guide to take us around so had the benefit of a local knowledge- such an delight!

I suggest that you have sun protection as the grounds are very large and often in the open- its HOT- don't let this put you off seeing it.

The gardens and buildings are exquisite! So much care goes in to the upkeep of the Citadel and surrounds."
"We have seen similar palace complexes in other parts of the world (e.g., Korea), so there was not much novelty about this one. However, it is one of the nicest pieces of history in Hue and tells us a lot about the Nguyen dynasty and Vietnamese origins. It is quite vast and one keeps going from one square enclosure to another. So prepare to walk a lot and take a guide if possible since the exit routes are diverted and you'll unnecessarily waste your energy finding it."
Amazing place to spend couple of hours. Take a local guide to really understand why this is the UNESCO world heritage spot.
Crossing door after door before taking a meditative walk into different pavilions... the rain belongs this area...
No wonder this is a UNESCO world heritage site. Do some background reading and prepare to be amazed. In fact do it with a local guide and you will enjoy a great couple of hours!
Amazing. But I would recommend having a guide to really experience the citadel. Interesting take on the war etc.
"If you spend your money to come here you will be disappointed! The entire place is rundown and overgrown. Everything needs a good gurney and mow.
It’s touted as an amazing ancient city, but it’s from the 1600s and almost all of it has been rebuilt in an unsympathetic way. So far 4/10."
"Missed seeing the Citadel in 1994 so were excited to visit this time. We found it very interesting. Interesting to see the history of the Imperial City and how they honor the ruling class. Big, expansive site. Great wandering around and soaking in the atmosphere. Visiting Hue and not spending time at the Citadel is just not right."
"My favourite sight so far in Vietnam. Beautiful and very vast grounds. Some are still in ruins from the war but really adds to the rustic feel. Plenty of photo exhibitions around the grounds to show how the Citadel looked in the early 20th century. This is partially a ruin so not really accessible for wheelchairs or prams. We bought our two year old toddler and carried her most of the time as the ground is pretty uneven and some stair tiles aren’t very stable. Exit gate is different from the entry, so don’t walk back to the entry like we did! Entry fee was 150k per adult and 270k per adult for a tour and I wish we had done the tour as I didn’t realise how big the citadel was."
"We went on a very wet day, which probably didnt help us form the right opinion of this place. It's a huge site, with lots of open areas. You can quite literally see where Vietnam's old history and more recent history meet - bullet holes pepper the walls of pagodas, ruins lay overgrown. It's clear that redevelopment is starting to happen at this site, but until then quite a few of the once grand buildings are now washed out and unloved. We visited knowing this, but i imagine that for others who were expecting more from this site, it may be disappointing. We were often the only tourists around at some of the places, which was nice. Be warned though - in the rain the paths became super slippery and very dangerous, we saw two people slip and one person in our group also had a slip. Luckily there were toilets dotted around to clean up the cuts!"
"It’s a shame that this beautiful palace was destroyed by wars and until today, many parts are still in process of restoration. Would be better if there are tourist maps at the entrance to explain the significance and importance of the artifacts and sections of the palace."
"We had a lovely walk around the Imperial City, it probably takes around 3 - 4 hours to do properly , although i think we did it in a couple as we didn't look at absolutely everything and our teenager was getting bored! This was the only place we didn't have a tour guide and on reflection we should have as doing it ourselves probably resulted in us missing some historical information."
"No visit to Hue is complete without seeing the Imperial Citadel and Forbidden City. It is a glimpse into the life of the Nguyen Emperors of the 19th and 20th centuries. The Entrance Gate is quite imposing. Once inside there are serene ponds leading to the Forbidden City.

The Forbidden City is quite large but is only partially restored. Out guide, Man Nguyen, took us on the path less traveled meaning that we were often alone and away from the crowds. A guide is necessary to negotiate the various buildings and explain the history of the Nguyen Emperors. Most of the buildings are built in the Chinese style of the period. The Co Ha Garden is interesting to see the French influence,

During the Tet Offensive of 1968 the Viet Cong occupied the Imperial Citadel. Some of the walls still show the bullet strikes.

Be prepared for a lot of walking as the site is massive and bring water."
"Travelled here with a group. Ticketing was simple and we got in soon after. Well maintained area, would have been good to see more information about the war etc. Must visit."
"Probably a bit harsh as we were walking in the rain and I got soaked so as it’s a big site I thought we would actually go inside a palace, but no.
I imagine it’s better in the warm sunshine!"
Loved wandering around the citadel... lots of little hidden laneways & gardens. Very well kept temples - obviously painstakingly restored following the destruction during the war. Everything is well sign posted & you are given an English map as part of your entrance ticket.
"The architecture is impressive, no question. We missed more historic exhibits (small in particular, i.e. weapons, instruments, every-day tools, Nguyen's treasures etc."
Came back to the Citadel 18 years after our first visit. Several improvements following the Heritage Site designation. Really enjoyed the visit.
The magnificant old palace is a must for traveler to Hue. There are so many items and building that worth a visit as well as picture taking. Don't miss this!
"The ancient citadel is being painstakingly rebuilt after the destruction from the 1968 battle. Battle damage is still evident and in comparison much has been accomplished. I will point out that it was not the marine corps that deliberately flattened the place. Just saying for the record.
Beautiful architecture. Well worth a day's visit."
"We (two parents with 11 & 9 year olds) enjoyed the citadel. It is a sprawling complex, and there are plenty of side sites to see.
TIP: Make sure you have small bills so you can buy some fish feed (~5 kDong) to feed the carp (at several lakes, look for the little slef-serve boxes). That (and ice-cream from the vendors inside) was one of the highlight of the visit for the kids.
Make sure you follow some of the smaller paths, because some of the more interesting pavilions were hidden on the East side.
It was very crowded when we were there, but you can find quiet areas.
It could do with some restoration, and some more signage.
Definitely worth the visit, though."
"As an American, I stood in one of the many courtyards of the Hue Imperial City humbled and silenced as the afternoon rains soaked the innards of my sneakers. Humbled by the history forever engraved in the restored temples and palaces of this urban fortress. Silenced by the blooded battle waged by my countrymen for a cause never fully explained. The many war images of Hue in the aftermath of the 1968 battle contrasted with its current incarnation is a searing monument to those who fought for the right to be citizens of their nation on their terms. In the silence of the afternoon rains, one feels an abiding farewell to the empire that was America and a recognition of a nation long ago challenged but certain of its path forward."
"Was interesting to learn about the dynasty in the olden Vietnam days, but the Citadel has not much left to see, as most of the structures and buildings were destroyed during the war.

We took a guided tour (purchased at the ticketing counter), which helped us understand more about the place. It would be quite impossible to make sense of anything without the guide, so would highly recommend all visitors to add on the guided tour!"
"I didn't even expect to find this in Hue. It's abig area you can wonder around for hours. The only thing is that I asked when the place close from the guards, they all said 6pm, so I thought that's when the gates are closed. I got there a bit late and tried to hurry to see even a glance of it, suddenly I noticed I was almost alone in the Citadel running around trying to find an exit at 17.30. I managed to just get put before the last gate closed, I have no idea what would have happened if I missed that. There was no warning that they are closing the gates. So for me 1,5 hours was too little time to visit. Could probably have used 3-4 hours for the visit."
"The Imperial city was nice and had a lot to see. I would definitely recommend a guide, or else you won't know anything that's going on! And there is a lot of cool history here."
"One first sight, the Citadel feels like the backdrop of Chinese period dramas, showing the predominance of indo China influence . Part of the compound was destroyed during the war but the place still has a lot of historical insights to offer. Other than looking at the layout and landscaping of the imperial compound, the architecture of the buildings consists of intricately designed motif in the form of mosaic art. This is a must-visit if you intend to visit Hue as it forms the very basis of Hue's historical status."
"Beautiful buildings - especially the purper city, and it is different from any other place. Vast property so you need to take time for the visit."
Visit this place in the afternoon so it was less busy. I really enjoyed the story about Nguyen dynasty as the last one in Vietnam. will highly recommended for all traveler get to Hue should come to visit.
"This place has very beautiful historical atmosphere. The rebuild temples and houses are amazing, but many parts of citadela needs reconstruction yet. Information boars are very poor and very often you don’t know where you are."
"Having visited many palaces and temples including the Forbidden City in Beijing, we went in fearing the worst. After all this place was devastated during the war.
Well I was stunned. Brilliantly renovated; beautifully laid out; fabulous gardens, moats and ponds and best of all very few visitors.
The highlight of our Vietnam tour. More serene than Angkor Wat, more entertaining than many similar places. Musicians in traditional dress; the oldest active theatre in Vietnam - and funniest of all a line up of Chinese in rickshaws."
"Visited with my partner and his mum this winter.

Cost is 150.000 dong to get in and entrance is via the main gate in the south.

The main gate is beautiful and so are the temples in the southwest! Food and drinks are a little overpriced inside so make sure you pack some water and head to the local restaurants for lunch instead!

We walked ourselves around with a tour book (lonely planet) but a free tour may have been better as it is not well signposted inside."
The Citadel suffered serious damages during the Vietnam war. Fortunately many parts has been renovated during the last decades. It is good to have a guide in the area. There is lot of historical events and stories available.
We spent around 2 hours exploring the site without a guide. Very easy to navigate around yourself and read from the information provided. Only one or two areas to buy a drink and rest. Worth the visit.
"we didn't get to see much in the rain, our bad luck.
dont hire the buggy, the drivers give you a rate of USD 10 per hour, which you can bargain to half it, but they take you around to places you dont want to and end up taking more time thus pay more.
Suggest best to visit with a guide or go alone but on a sunny day."
You should have a knowledgeable guide with you for this tour as they will help to bring the history to life. We had a very good experience with our tour guide Binh thru VM travel services. Massive grounds and lots of information and buildings to wade through.
"The Citadel Complex is from the Nguyen Dynasty . It is a sprawling complex of temples, pavillions, moats, walls, gates museums and galleries. Its historical importance is the attraction here . Lots of little known facts are unveiled during our walking tour ."
"The Citadel is worth a visit because of its history. There are still one or two interesting buildings to visit within the walls but when you view the model of what was there it is tragic to see how much has been lost: it must have been magnificent it its heyday. There is some construction under way and when complete this will add significantly to the experience. That said the site is atmospheric, there are plenty of information boards to read and digest and in my opinion it is well worth the modest entrance fee and spending a couple of hours wondering around the site."
Rained but well worth it. Exo Tours very good so much history. Don’t annoy the monks by trying to take photos as they all know Kung Fu!!😂
Nice place for a walk and watch the surroundings but nothing breathtaking. When compared to other similar places it is just OK
Overall the Imperial Palace is a great experience in Hue which gives you a real strong look into some important Vietnamese history! Wish I got to spend more time here and would look at doing a quided tour next time as it is quite alot of ground to cover on foot.
"Very large beautiful place with a rich history and good for photos. Only 150,000 vnd per entry. Would recommend dedicating at least a couple of hours to explore fully as there’s heaps of different things to see. City is currently undergoing restoration which didn’t really interfere with our access and it will look even more amazing when it’s done. A lot of it is empty fields with a bit of ruins from the war which is unfortunate but still definitely worth the visit, even in the rainy season."
This is a must see in Hue. It will take a few hours to make it through the compound so wear comfortable shoes and bring water. I did not book a tour but I wish I would have. There are a few areas where information is available but not nearly enough. The ticket booth sells a combo ticket to see other main sights. Before purchasing it make sure you are willing to pay for a driver or taxi as the other sights are outside of the main area.
"Even the koi fish are in on the beauty of this site. We were there for all of the morning and part of the afternoon. Still, we did not visit all of the different structures but we tried to take in as much as we could, even impromptu Vietnamese folkloric dances by professional groups rehearsing their numbers. As I mentioned previously, you wonder, even with quasi deity cultures how the Vietnamese people accepted the over the top luxury of these hereditary emperors"
"Amazing sight. Worth seeing and exploring. It is magnificent. Make sure you see all the parts and buildings , lakes and sights."
"Found the Imperial City tranquil and full of nooks and corners to explore. The write-ups are clear and extensive as well — it is possible to get a sense of the Nguyen dynasty, along with the personalities and achievements of the various emperors, from reading the write-ups alone.

The black and white photos displayed all over the Imperial city take a person back in time — it is quite something to imagine the royal processions and horses and mandarins and elephants in the city you are standing in, paying their respects to the monarch in a bygone, but still recent, era."
"Our driver dropped us just entering the city walls. There were barely any signs to lead us to the main attraction and we spent tens of minutes wandering and getting harassed by scammy rickshaw riders.

When we finally got in, it as quite pretty, but we got bitten by mozzies. I must admit it was my wife who wanted to visit The Imperial City, and i'm not so keen on such stuff.

Didn't see any toilets."
Vanho provided an excellent day. She is very knowledgeable about history of the antiquities and made the day very entertaining. Highly recommended.
"Enjoyed a great visit to the old Vietnamese capital of Hue. The site is huge, many different buildings to see in the Citadel, this attraction offers a walking history tour through over a thousand years of Vietnamese history, royal palaces , wardrobes, paintings and in particular architectural highlights make the Citadel a must see attraction."
"The extensive buildings & grounds are interesting & well worth 2 to 3 hours of walking around & the 150,000vnd fee. Near the entrance is a little side room where you can hire a guide for an hour which was worthwhile for us as we hadn’t done our homework on the history. Unfortunately the infrastructure is really lacking: the public toilets were filthy (I’m not that fussy), the cafe food (Banh mi & sandwich & local selection) was almost inedible, no maps or literature or audio tape available."
"Long story short, a smaller version of the forbidden city in Beijing, right down to the language. It is nice and not crowded, so you could spend a whole day wandering and reading the manuscripts and photos hanging on the walls."
"Recommend take a guided tour of the Citadel as you will not pick up all the history. I would recommend walking through the narrow streets that border on the moat that sounds the Citadel. A fascinating walk through narrow lanes, small shops and local houses that open onto the street"
"We walked around this imperial city for an afternoon, the culture and history behind it really makes it worth every penny.

The place is huge therefore it doesn't feel overcrowded and you can just wonder around the grounds at a nice leisurely pace"
"I wasn’t so intrigued by this place at first, but decided to go after many recommendations. The city is quite small, so there isn’t too much to see to begin with. I paid about 100,000 dong to enter, which is relatively steep for Vietnam. However, I was immediately greatful to find a peaceful place to escape the noisy city. It was larger than expected, having many different temples and gardens. A great place to relax and learn about the culture and history of Hue. I guide would have been nice to learn more. You can easily spend a couple of hours here. Overall, enjoyable."
"Reading all reviews and hearing praises from locals, I was excited to see the Imperial City. It's a large area that lasts back 200 years but given the amount of money they're making, the site is poorly maintained, hardly any valuable info visible and no real stunning buildings. It's probably necessary to book a guide because otherwise it's pretty boring.
Wouldn't consider coming back"
"The Citadel is a must visit if you visit Hue. It is a world heritage site. As the grounds are large, one could spend a good few hours leisurely strolling and enjoying the site. Much of it has been destroyed by US bombing during the Vietnam War though restoration efforts have been underway to restore the palace to its glorious past state. Still, there is remaining structure for a good morning or afternoon walk (yes be prepared to walk). Strong Chinese influence is clearly evident; those of you who have visited the Forbidden City in Beijing, China would relate well. The visit would probably be more fruitful and enjoyable if you would first do some reading up on the Citadel's history before visiting."
"Old history all the way - essy to get around, need good walking shoes as it lots of walking to get around it all. 1 day was enough for me overall to see most of it."
"Most visited place in Hue for a good reason
Grand Scale in the heart of the old city
Gives one a historical perspective on the Imperial City
Make it your first stop!"
"The Citadel, an imposing palace can be entered through three gates - the king, mandarins and military. This was the office of the Emperor where they ruled for 140 years, before the last emperor abdicated the throne"
"Nice refurbished palace but a sad place once you see the pics after the war before rebuild! Horror of devastation from war .
Small palace with many sectors, if you want to take the golf cart ride , do book in advance. Many tour groups book it and they don’t have additional slot or car when we went to enquire. Good for self Explore and you can find a spot to sit and imagine what it was before the war. Don’t miss the 2 big cauldron that’s originally from the palace. It is the open space after the throne hall."
"Spent 4 hours at the Citadel and saw maybe only 10% but was incredibly beautiful site to visit. Plenty of video displays describing the site and photos and signs plentiful. Beautiful gardens and majestic palaces, temples and gates. Was criminal that US almost flattened the place during the war but reconstruction ongoing. Slightly incongruous to send US planes on display outside the Citadel. Cover knees and shoulders if you want to explore inside some buildings."
A large site filled with allkinds of monuments. A must go when you visit Hue. So many things to see. Splendid.
We spend an entire morning at the citadel. It’s a beautiful historic site with many buildings in which various photos and artefacts are presented. Most are accompanied by English explanations. Some floors are quite slippery after a rainy day. Come early to avoid tour groups and be aware that taxis can be expensive as they tend to do a full round around the site on their way back to town.
It was a beautiful and quite place in the hum of the city. Wear good walking shoes and perhaps bring a book to read in the quite spaces.
This place is very nice place for people who love historic. One thing is the electric car running around and it’s not safe for travel.
"This place is fantastic. Well worth a visit.

It is a large site with plenty to see. The coi are cool to feed. The gardens are beautiful and the buildings are very nice to walk around."
"The Citadel is huge, you want an excellent few hours being around it all. It's very intriguing to hear the past and picture the lifestyle at time whilst recognizing it was under hundred years ago and folks still lived this way. Downside - extremely warm and never much shade. Highlight - 2 elephants walking all around the grounds!"
"A quick trip here is part of any visit to Hue, but there is really not much to see. Easy to visit in less than 3 hours,2 if you are a high energy person."
We paid 150k dong per pax and spent 3hours strolling around the grounds. The exit was difficult to find for us and we got a little lost. Nice place to take pictures and read a little history on the old capital of Vietnam.
"We visit the citadel during the afternoon and it took us about two hours, all the sign are with English explanations.

We also visit the outside at night.

Very nice and the wall is lighted with nice colors."
Nice to stroll around and take it all in. a lot of changes in 26 years since I last visited. Was not as bad as some thought very easy.
"Great place to spend half a day, but get the audio guide and learn as you go. Some of the buildings were bombed in the war but slowly being restored"
"I would definitely add the Citadel to your list of places to visit while in Hue. It's a large complex that has lots of walking so either wear comfortable shoes or pay to be driven around. There are no paper maps available to download something on your phone before you arrive. I did my own tour (read from online) which gave me some flexibility to explore all the nooks and crannies. I liked that I could just go at my own pace. Admissions to the Antiquities museum (next door) is included, be sure to keep some sort of proof of purchase so you can get in if you chose."
The citadel complex is huge and unfortunately much of it destroyed by both the Americans and the NVA during fighting as both had occupied it at some point. Still splendid architecture reflecting what must have been a very impressive royal palace. Some reconstruction is underway but the destruction a real shame.
"I think anywhere requires admission should have a free tourist map!
Don't miss the arts n crafts shop just outside the exit!"
"The site is very impressive, beautifully laid out and restoration work always being done. It's not expensive to enter, but there is no reentry so take a packed lunch! The information is clear and adds an interesting history to the site too. I imagine it would be a lovely place to wander round and explore at a slow pace when the weather is nice, with plenty of trees to provide shade. However it chucked it down with rain whilst we visited and so some of the romance was replaced by urgently trying to find cover! Obviously that isn't the fault of the site, but with limited places to get out of the rain it should be considered."
"This place is huge, you can spend hours wandering around if you’d like, the bathrooms are reasonable, but it is pretty pricey. It seems like they are trying to renovate a lot of areas so it takes away from the historical feeling a bit. The exit is very far away from the entrance so be aware when you leave. I wouldn’t say this is a must see in Hue but if you’re looking for something to do for a few hours in town it’s an ok place to visit."
Be prepared for a lot of walking and a lot of history of the imperial kind. Worth taking everything in and imagining a life so very far removed from what we know. Worth the effort.
"The Citadel . Well to travelers I would like to warn you about the people outside the entrance with the bike style Ricahaws. They tell you they with take you for one hour through the Citadel for one hour.
We thought something was wrong when they turn the other way. It’s a scam big time they take you around it Nd try to get you into the museum . If you don’t want to the trek takes 1/2 hour. They want 600,000 Dong total burn we gave them 400,000!and walk away totally disgusted .
WARNING TO ALL !"
"A must do if you are in Hue. I recommend that you go early in the morning or in the late afternoon when it’s cooler. You can get a guide at the ticket office or if you have a guide book you will be okay. there’s lots to see. Take you time. If you have to, sit on the benches scattered around the place. The area near the gardens was a good spot. The citadel is being restored.Look out for the beautiful mosaic work on the roof facades."
I would have given it more stars but I saw this as part of a full day tour of Hue and the Royal Tombs and as this was the last stop we sadly ran out of time and therefore only saw the 'highlights' as it were. However my tour guide was good with the history and although it is now a ruin for the most part it is easy to see the splendour that it once was. The garden is beautiful and tranquil and I now better understand the story behind the water puppet shows.
"Spend 3 hours learning about the The Imperial City. This walled enclosure within the citadel (Kinh thành) of the city of Huế, the imperial capital of Vietnam."
This is a place where the Nyugen Dynasty Kings and families worked and lived. Visit it as it tells the history of the Nyugen Dynasty.
"There is not much to see there but ruins. If you love history, just buy a good history book and look at the best pictures on the internet instead of going there."
"Very interesting place of history, how life was many years ago for the people of Hue, still doing renovations to restore the buildings, a place worth visiting when in Hue"
"Our Local Buddy Tour guide, Thanh, took us here for a day trip from Hoi An which was great as he had a way with avoiding the clusters of tourists. It was very impressive learning the history of the Imperial City and the emperors. The buildings are magnificent and it is so wonderful to see it being restored and looked after. Worth the trip."
"The main reason for visiting Hue is its status as a former capital of Vietnam from 1802 to 1945 during the reign of the Nguyen dynastic emperors. UNESCO declared it as a world heritage site in 1993. We had a day tour and covered the three historic sites. Some of the buildings were in disrepair which is a shame. UNESCO and other NGOs are funding the restoration of the sites. It is striking that ancient Chinese customs and cultures heavily influenced the Imperial Hierarchy.

We found the visits very interesting. It is worth a visit."
A good historic site . Requires a bit of walking . The electric bus can be pre booked beforehand and is recommended.
"A Trip to Hue is incomplete without visiting the Imperial City along with its Tombs
We were here on a day visit and did not have a lot of time at our hand yet we ensured that imperial city was the first place we covered
We took a cyclo tour of it for 2lkahs vnd and then we walked for around a couple of hours to explore the city from.within"
"Interesting,vast place. Amazing to imagine it all in its prime. I am glad it is being restored.
Definitely worth a visit"
Web says tickets available until 5pm. We arrived at 4.45 after being waylaid by a deceitful dragon boat guide who assured us as long as we bought the tickets before 5 we could go in. We were turned away they refused to sell us tickets because we didnt have enough time.......can I just ask If you are not going to sell tickets until 5 pm why are you advertising that you can buy them and go in as long as its before 5. After talking to a few people maybe its just they don't want to hang around and wait for people? If the attraction closes at 5.30 and you arent going to sell tickets unless people have 2 hours to visit the ticket booth should be advertised as no more entry after that time not the actual time which is clearly stated as 5pm everywhere and to all local knowledge. Not good enough. The citadel was the main reason we came to Hue and after first being detoured by a dragon boat that clearly gave us the wrong information and then not being able to enter at all our holiday to hue is ruined. We are only here one day and come back tomorrow is not an acceptable response when you claim to be open until 5. Is this common practice? Or did we just get a lazy staff member? Either way I expect an explanation!
"This is one of the main reasons to visit Hue & I was disappointed as the place has still to regain its previous splendour from its prime time
It’s obvious why - it was battered in 1968 from the USA and earlier in 1947
They have done a great job restoring what they can to it’s past but it’s a massive & obviously very expensive job
The gardens are fantastic & it was great to see some of the photos of 1968 & the restored buildings but it would be better to see these by each building & not at the front as it means so little
It’s definitely still worth a trip but just don’t expect a Citadel in full repair"
"Huge complex with lots to see and take photos of. A definite must see in Huê.
Plenty of places to buy drinks, souvenirs and use the toilet.
Could probably spend most of a day there but we were just there a few hours which was fine for us.
Some restoration being done at the moment but not intrusive.
We were with a guide so got information from him. Not sure if there was a lot around to read yourself but you could probably get a guide book from the complex."
It is huge. Many historical photographs to view. Those familiar with the Tet Offensive during the Vietnam war will find the history during this period exceptional of interest. If traveling with a tourist group your trip leader will give history and tour. If traveling without tour group I strongly suggest a guide.
"We had been there on an incredibly popular day. take an umbrella in case you've one, helps maintain you cooler than simply a hat. Directly in the city so it is not hard to walk to. Fascinating, we did find a guide and wish we'd thought. It was interesting and huge to look at, though we did not appreciate what we had been seeing. Elephant rides there. Felt sorry for elephants."
"Not as impressive as many other Ancient or UNESCO sites.
Probably a good portion was destroyed in war"
This was very interesting and informative. We had a great local guide with lots of info and good English. It was a very hot day and this place was huge! Wear a hat!
Visited here for a couple of hours as part of our tour. Lovely to wander round and find out the history of the place.
"Visiting the Hue Imperial City makes me want to study the Vietnam dynasties ruled by the 13 kings. Entrance fees per person is about VND150,000. You can purchased the tour guide service for VND150,000 at the counter. It is advisable to have a tour guode to understand the history of the place. There are a few ways to adventure the places either by walking, trishaw or car. Walking will take you 2 to 3 hours. Trishaw is estimated about VND150,000 per person.If you are in a rush or day trip to hue, then you can have the car ride which is about VNd240,000 for 45 minutes. after visiting the place, you will leave by the east entrance. you can visit the museum for free. walk out of the east entrance, main road turn right and then first road turn left. about 50m will be the museum."
"The detail in the buildings is stunning, it's the kind of thing I've only seen in movies. The guide explained the important history. So glad we saw it."
Lot of background information and huge place to explore. We loved it. The combi ticket includes two tombs outside of hue! Which i also recommend!
Most of it is open grounds as much was destroyed during the war. A little disappointing but worht a short visit.
"Although it needs restoring , and this will take years, it’s a must to get a feel for Hue’s past. A half day should be enough to get a feel for its historical past and it’s worth taking time to soak up the atmosphere in the quiet areas. There are cafe facilities and adequate toilet facilities."
"This place was the main reason for our stay in Hue and it did not disappoint....The palaces, pagodas, temples and gardens are just wonderful pieces of architecture and with all the historical information as well....half a day is a minimum...highly recommend"
"A most impressive historical Citadel with plenty to learn about as you would expect

You need a guide to make the most of it as it is enormous and easy to lose track of what you have / haven’t seen.

I just get infuriated when so many international travellers pay so little attention to clear signage and beliefs.... taking photos when they ask you not to, hats on when they ask you take them off etc..... it’s not a lot to ask when they open up so much important heritage to the public.... grrrr.... just downright bloody rude and disrespectful.

Enjoy!"
"We visited the citadel as a group, the entrance fee was 150k VND per person.
It was not the experience that we expected: only very few original buildings are left, you can only imagine how this citadel has been and life was for the emperor and his people. The models of the imperial city are helpful for that.

We thought there should be more informative signs in English, maybe this would improve the visit for foreigners."
"Today my wife and I took a Hue City Tour. We were in the company of nine other people from various companies. It was organised by Hue Deluxe Group Tour. The tour guide was Mr. Hoa. All of us agreed that he provided 5Star service. He is exceptionally knowledgeable and imparts his knowledge extremely effectively, with an appropriate level of repetition to ensure the information is fully absorbed by the group.

His English is flawless and we were delighted to have spent time with him on a very well organised tour of the Citadel and other historical sites of importance,

The driver was excellent and the lunch service first class.

Sean Brady"
"Definitely a must see in your trip to Vietnam. Huge palaces and temples worthwhile visiting.

I didn’t get a tour guide and probably you’d have a better experience but still, I strongly recommend it.

Be aware that you’ll have to walk a lot since the Imperial city is huge.

Also very advisable to wear proper clothes, not showing knees or shoulders."
"This place was another fascinating history lesson about the Nguyen Dynasty

Well worth the visit if you have not already been to the Tu Duc tomb or the Khai Din tomb"
"We went on a rainy day, so we didn’t walk around the whole area as much as we would’ve liked. However, it was a great way to see a bit of Hue history. Some of the decorations were really beautiful. I just wish that they didn’t place modern looking ads and photos everywhere, as it detracted from both the general atmosphere and some otherwise photogenic areas."
My reason for stopping in Hue to explore the ancient capital of Vietnam. This is a must to see. Very interesting. Just spend half a day walking around it. I found it refreshing to walk around the lakes in peace and quiet as well. Reflecting on how life must have been back then in the days when the emperors lived there..
If you like symmetry this is one for you. I know it is part of eastern culture but even so it caught me by surprise. We had poor weather for our trip but the palace was still impressive. Considering the battering it has suffered during the various conflicts it's amazing that it is still so intact. Use some imagination and get a mental impression of what it must have been like when it was whole and perfect.
"When you think of an Imperial City you think of some kind Asian Versailles.
I was expecting more information and more things to see.
I understand most of the things were stolen and destroyed.
Most of what you see is empty building, remodeled walls.
I couldn’t afford a guide (backpacking life)
And I got no information whatsoever.
Also, they don’t even give you a map. So take a picture before you go in."
Arguably one of the more interesting places in Vietnam to visit. We had a very good guide who explained in almost painstaking detail about how the palace functioned at the height of its existence.
Interesting and beautyfiul place. Good for chillin and romantic walks. Better wear comfortable shoes and take small water. There are few shops where you can buy another one. We also had coffee in caffeteria in the garden. Lovely wiew!
This place is a must see. Bringing you back to the old days of reign of imperials. It’s a beautiful place not to miss. In fact you can’t be in Hue without going to the citadel. The photo opportunities are enormous. You will learn so much there if you have a good guide. Go with one if you can. But if you don’t not to worry. There are writings on poster to give you a sense of the place.
We spent a couple of hours there as we had 1 day to visit Hue. The Citadel is really big and worth spending a few hours if you have the time. Its is beautiful and very interesting. Definitely get a guide to appreciate it the most.
"Worth visiting do not skip it. It was my favorite place in Vietnam.
Very colorful, beautifully restored, amazing for photos and learning about the history. I enjoyed it immensely."
"...But there were a lot of works being done during our visit so not everything was accessible.
Glad we did it anyway."
Unfortunately it was raining when we stooped for a visit but our guide was great even under the rain. It is quite a large site I wish I had taken more time to visit. It is a greta place for pictures.
The grounds the imperial city are very large and impressive. Many interesting buildings and artifacts that give you ani night into the Nguyen emperors. Give yourself at least an hour for a walk around.
Truly should not be missed on a trip to Vietnam. So much us revealed walking through the Imperisl City. A guide enhances the experience.
"This place is vast, as is the history. Personally, I didn't hire a guide but was happy just to wander around and look at the architecture. They had quite a bit of the history in photograph displays along the walls. I found the place to be beautiful and peaceful. They are currently working on renovations to rebuild many of the destroyed buildings. It is sad to think that such history and art was ruined due to war."
"Really unimpressed with the beautiful architecture & views. Was beyond our expectations. Vietnam has a rich history & culture. Beautiful, warm & friendly people."
"150k to enter, and its a nice walk through the gardens which are well maintained. Personally if you're time restricted I suggest going to the tombs over the citadel as we found them much more beautiful! A nice afternoon though!"
"I was reading a book on the 1968 Tet offensive in Hue so this was an ideal opportunity to visit the Citadel and get a feel for the atmosphere.
Sadly the conflict had caused so much damage to the Forbidden city but hopefully the renovation will continue to restore this lovely place to it's glory."
"Plan your trip to have a walk through the citadel. It takes about 1 hour for a quick tour and if you’d like to stop and read somebody the info, plan for 2 hours."
"Great place to learn more about history of Vietnam. Remember to take water, suncream and to be in proper cloth. You need min. 3h to see most of buildings."
"Great place to walk around and use some time up in Hue or you can pay for electric car to drive you around,you can also organize a guided tour and learn more about the imperial city’s history,there are some refreshment and souvenir shops within the city."
"This is an awesome place. We had a tour guide who gave us a great potted history of all the Nguyen Kings between 1802 and 1945. What a rag tag bunch they were.

Lovely buildings and most impressive were the gardens. We were supposed to be there for 2 hours and stayed for over 3.

Hats off to UNESCO for the support they are providing to restore this back to its former glory."
"Best sight in Hue for sure (probably the only one). Amazing work with the restoration procedure, the Citadel was completely destroyed during the war and now is most of the place standing again!"
Spent quite a while looking over this place there is so much to see. We had our guide with us so she was able to guide and inform us. It is packed with history be prepared to spend time walking which we took at a gentle pace because of the mixed ability of our group. Despite lots of people there is a quietness about the place which is restful. Wouldn't have skipped visiting this place
"We visited it with an organized small group, 4 people plus the guide
Was really interesting and nice to wonder around this ancient place, they are keeping restoring new buildings thy have been ruined during the was
Definitively worth a visit and probably also an overnight in town"
Amazing decoration and building with a lot of things to see and learn. A bit sad that the restoration process takes a lot of time and not so many items remains to help tourists understand how the past were
"The Tet offensive in the city of Hue was the bloodiest battle of the war. We were told that 25,000 Vietnamese civilians died in a period of 3 week.
The citadel is an impressive structure. Surrounded by wide moats it contains the Imperial city with the purple room.
A fair amount of walking but well worth it. Sculptures abound with carvings depicting Vietnamese culture"
"I recommend visiting with a good tour guide, even tough I didn't.

Be prepared to walk a lot and do a lot of interesting reading.

I spent 4h there to see all with time.

For history lovers is the best program in Hue.

Great work by the Vietnamese reconstructing what was destroyed by the war."
Impressive to finally see s place I first heard about at Tet 1968? Magnificent history. Even bought a book to follow up and learn more.
Interesting old city dynasty and some renovated areas with more being developed in unison with UNESCO. Interesting with a guide to.provide an overview of how the city and dynasty looked and functioned
big and impressive are with a lot of history. so beautiful the golden dragon in the middle ws my light
"Big and impressive are with a lot of history.
The golden dragon in the middle wa my highlight. It’s just incredible."
"We went in the afternoon when it wasn't so hot and had a pleasant walk around reading the information available. The sunset was quite lovely among the ruins and reconstructed parts of the citadel.
There are many parts still being rebuilt but hopefully they will keep the sobering remnants of the battle that took place. Nontheless there are beautiful architectural flairs that survived the Viet Minh/American conflict but I would recommend finding more information online to read as you walk around."
"I'm frankly at a loss for words, so grand and glorious is this city within a city. Take your time and add an extra day if you are a true history buff. The admission here included a ticket to the nearby museum of Royal Antiquities. If you don't arrive as part of a tour but you want a guide, arrangements can be made at the point of ticket purchase, and then you'll pay for both things at the same time. I had a local University student giving me a free tour, so I can't review the guide services."
"We saw the Citadel and Place in 33 Celsius with me being pregnant. Was hot but do-able. Either way, absolutely a must see in Hue. Make use of the kiosks in the buildings on the western side of the Palace to cool off. The photo exhibits throughout were great too!"
"This beautiful citadel, was the seat or royalty within Vietnam for a hundred years, the palace was built in a style of luxury and opulence that only a King could imagine. The grand nature of the buildings can be seen both in what is left of the original structures and also those rebuilt in the 1990s. The Citadel was a stronghold of the North Vietnamese during then American invasion, when they sought to take back the South during the Tet offensive. The Americans solution was to bomb them out and in doing so destroyed nearly all of the inner sanctum that was the domain of the king. Most defiantly worth a visit when in the area."
"It's noisy - pushy and dirty!

Although if you want to be asked to rent a bike 50 times a day this is the place for you!

And in fairness - cheap loud late bars abound - so maybe it's just me!"
"Even though it was extremely hot the day of our visit, we still enjoyed the stories of the days of the kings and their concubines. It is nice to see them restoring the entire facility back to its original state. Worth the visit to start to understand the early history of Vietnam."
Very nice walk around the citadel and a few temples. Monks and Vietnamese students ask tourists questions so they can try and learn English better.
"This place is amazing! is a must if you are in Hue.
you can either book a day trip in Hue where you pay extra the entrance fee to this place and couple of tombs but you get much for that money.
If you are planning on visiting tombs (which I recommend) you can buy the entrance at this place together with the entrance fee for the tombs.
280 D.
otherwise entrance fee alone for the citadel is 150 and for each tomb 100 D.
highly recommended place!!"
"This is quite a magnificent place to visit. There were several vietnamese models in traditional dress just outside the Citadel and they allowed us to take their picture. Inside the citadel we had a walk of about 2 km. It's very beautiful and interesting, just very hot and humid but absolutely worth visiting."
Such a lovely day exploring The Citadel. Bigger than I expected! Could easily spend a few hours here wandering around. Would deffo recommend!
"Spent a few hours exploring around the imperial city later in the afternoon to avoid crowds and heat!

It was relatively quiet and we enjoyed seeing and reading about each section. The views from near the garden overlooking the huge Vietnam flag are stunning too!

You have to come here if you are in Hue and you won’t be disappointed!"
"Came to Hue for a day trip from Da Nang and even arriving at 11:00, we could tell we wouldn't see everything. For 150,000 Dong each, we would say it's quite fair in price, but especially for those who love roaming around ancient buildings. We are not huge fans, but we still appreciate the culture and history. Also, some of the restoration works of the buildings are amazing. We would say you would need a whole day here for a culture and history buff, but 3 hours is enough for everyone else. We do think they should be some more information in each place as each sites contains a paragraph of information in three languages. And the vendors trying to sell the books on the Nyugen Dynasty, sell it for almost 1 million Dong. That's over £30!
Still if you are in Hue, it's the main attraction. Don't give it a miss!"
"You wouldn't understand what the signs are actually saying, so you'll have to look up the history to actually understand what the signs say."
Must see in Hue. It is huge and they did a good job with the restauration of the place. A lot is explained in english therefore it can be visited without guide.
"A must see when in Hué. Be ready to walk a lot as there is so much to see, you could spend all day there."
"It's similar to Chinese Palace in Beijing.
But she has different stories.
Walking in this historical palaces with a knowledgeable guide, you can understand more Vietnam.
Best recommendation.

這裡有點像中國北京的紫禁城。
但是這裡有著截然不同的故事。
隨著一個知識豐富的嚮導，你可以更了解越南。
非常推薦。"
"You can walk there from the city across the river. It was about 3km or 40 mins from Cherish hotel. We walked it in the evening to see where it was and in the cool. The next day we visited again with an English speaking guide which was great to learn the history and back stories. We used Your Vietnam Travel for our day trip which included lady pagoda, the Citadel, 2 tombs, lunch and an incense making demo. It was a long day in the heat but worth it if you can handle the sweating."
"Our guide, Hero, was very good, and we learned a lot from him about the royal dynasty from 1800-1940.
We went to the Dong Da riverside market. It’s a total scam if you’re not a savvy shopper, and the stall holders were so pushy. I think our friend Hero was a part of the scam too. I really didn’t enjoy that, and it spoiled my day. Avoid those markets if you don’t want to be harassed."
"The home of the Emperors, their servants, concubines and eunuchs. I have never been to such a place. I didn’t really know what to expect, but the history, the stories, the tales, the layout and the grandeur of the Citadel is a site to behold for the traveller. It was amazing to witness the industry of communities, the exact design of the imperial city, its connection with the sun and moon.

The Citadel is a must see if you are visiting Hue!"
"I was amazed at the size of the Citadel. Its huge.
I also did not realise how much was destroyed during the Vietnam war.
There is still a lot to see and appreciate and good to see a lot of rebuilding taking place
My recommendation would be to use a guide as you learn so much from someone that understands the history
Definitely worth visiting"
This really is a must see in Hue. It’s cheap as well as it only cost us 130k dong. If you are driving a moped make sure and find your own parking as some people will try charge you to park near their shops.
"This is an amazing place, I enjoyed learning about the area and its emperors and how people lived in the city. Although there are many tourist that come through here everyday, it is a large area so everyone can spread out and you get to explore largely on your own."
"the citadel is huge and magnificent from outside but when you reach inside you can not imagine how big and mysterious it is, it consists of several gardens, palaces, tombs and etc.
we visited there as a part of our tour and really enjoyed, it takes more than one hour to visit the place. i can say that it is really a must see in Hue."
"Hue Imperial City is surely breathtaking place to visit. Crowds spread out and you no longer have ""claustrophobic"" feeling. I saw some reconstruction works going on, but it made me wonder how authentic the whole place is, since old damaged brick wall/fence was repaired with a concrete and then repainted to match the brick color... hmmm... UNESCO?"
"Really enjoyable attraction. Our two young boys loved exploring the site and feeding the Koi fish just inside the entrance. Very affordable day out for the family. Food options a little limited, so recommend taking plenty of snacks. Lots of spots to buy drinks though. No paper maps available at the site, so best to research before arrival. Even in October, it was very warm and humid so take lots of water and consider umbrellas for shade."
Incredible place of world heritage site with royal theater and very majestic main entry. It was a very hot September day which made the visit tiring.
"It is sad that most of the building is destroyed during the war. Vietnam is doing a good job in preserving what that is left of it. A guide is a must to explore the site and learned its' rich history.
Must visit the site when in Hue."
"Great place to walk around the grounds and learn about past events and history good for tours
Tip have a tour guide"
Some people say skip it; DONT! It's so beautiful!! Although a bit pricey (in Vietnam standards) at 150.000 VND it is packed with beautiful architecture! The staff there keep an excellent care of the place.
This is a must-see area when you're in Hue. We were fortunate to have a very knowledgeable guide who suggested we attend there as part of our day tour. So much history and so much to see.
We took cyclos to get to the Citadel but an easy walk across the river from town would do it. The Citadel - Imperial City or Palace of Heavenly Peace was beautiful. It was a hot morning but we really enjoyed exploring this impressive palace complex. A lot like the Forbidden City in Beijing but more crumbling and charming in its own way with shady trees and unkempt grasses. Easy to wander here for an hour or two.
"In case you're going without a guidebook, it's really worth reading up on the story of the location and watching the short film once you turn up that describes about the complicated. Very much of the location was destroyed by battle, a lot of locations happen to be in the procedure for being restored, it does not take long being the concept. Thus, in case you do not make it there until 4pm, do not worry--you will be able to get yourself a beneficial go to in before it closes."
"The Citadel is massive, but all pretty much the same. Pleasant for a wander, throne room is nice. Plenty of historical information to read through, but unless you are a local or connected to the area it’s somewhat underwhelming. My son is crazy for history and will spend hours in museums, but this didn’t even hold his interest.
Also cost was five times any museum / site we have visited in Vietnam so far - 150K VND per person. Most have been 30K."
A very interesting place to visit. Had plenty of places for a cool drink on a hot day. Exhibits are excellent. The grounds fascinating with good information displayed around
"The grounds of the Citadel are quite large and it's worthwhile setting aside 2-3 hours to take it all in. Lovely pieces of architecture, pretty gardens and an interesting historical setting, giving you a good appreciation of the history of the Vietnamese monarchy in the 19th-20th century."
Expansive grounds with limited beauty however an important part of history. I walked in the front gate and out the back gate - 30 minutes I guess. Tick it off the box however think more interesting places to see around Hue.
A must see and enjoyable. We did a day tour including this and found it interesting. Pretty setting with lotus flowers.
"This place is really nice. Not just for pictures but for some cultural experience too. For 150.000 VND you get a lot to see. Best time to visit is right before sunset, the light makes everything even more beautiful and there are less people around."
"The Imperial city is a really interesting place to visit and we would highly recommend it as a must do when in Hue. The ticket price is reasonable for the 2.5 hours we spent within the walls.

A lot of the area was extensively damaged by the war, but the restoration work on the remaining buildings has been done to a high quality. We just wandered among the beautiful architecture and on going restoration works.

The temples and gates were a particular highlight."
"The architecture of the buildings were amazing and intriguing to see, especially when you look at how detailed their designs were and their use of colours. Information boards are available around but it still fails to communicate the history as not all of them were in English (mostly in Vietnamese). Would recommend going in with a tour guide or do your research beforehand to better experience the palace!"
"Very impressive and so huge, it must have been so beautiful in its day, so many beautiful buildings with great detail, a lot has been lost to age and bombing during the war but is being renovated by UNESCO. Very large and a lot of walking, would recomend"
"This impressive of home of the emperors of the Nguyen Dynasty, who lived here with their families. Much of the Citadel was destroyed in 1968 but since then it has gradually been restored to its beauty. The grounds were massive large complex and takes time to walk around."
"Among the many places to visit in the Imperial City, I would urge all visitors to go to the walled garden in the northeast area. It has hundreds of miniature plants in traditional blue and white porcelain vases, with a symbolic mountain on one side, and a strange artificial cave on the other side. This structure is in ruins, but it has a staircase which goes to the water level of the moat surrounding the garden. There is a little pavilion in the garden where one can get excellent cold juice and hot espresso."
"This sprawling complex in Hue was where the Emperors of old would have lived and conducted all their business. There was even a part of the citadel known as “The Forbidden Purple City,” which, much like China's Forbidden City, was reserved for only the most important people in Vietnam.

Unfortunately, the Imperial Citadel today is just a shadow of what it once was. The temples, pavilions, walls, and gates were damaged first during skirmishes with the French in 1947, and then most of what was left was destroyed by American forces during the  American-Vietnam War in 1968.

The Imperial Citadel is still well worth a visit, though, even if the restoration process has been slow. You can still see some of the imposing city gates and walls, beautifully restored halls (like the one pictured below), and the ancient moat that's fed by the Perfume River."
"You can spend hours going over this huge site.
Some parts are under reconstruction and when this major effort will be finished (probably in a few years), it will make it a jem"
"A very large multi walled fortification originally built to protect kings. An outer wall 2,5 km square and three inner walls - all massively( 3 metres) thick and only one narrow entrance arch on each side, There was horrendous carnage / casualties here during Vietnam War and you can see why the place was so hard to attack. A lot of work has gone in to restoring the area (still ongoing) whilst maintaining the original ancient look, Well worth a visit,"
Amazing restoration of important historical site. Best to get a tour guide to help explain the site.
"When our ship called at DaNang we had the option to visit Hoi An or Hue. We're so glad we selected Hue. The Citadel, though badly damaged during the war, is well rebuilt and truly worthy of UNESCO status. The place is massive--the guide said 1200 acres--so it was good to avail ourselves of the golf carts to drive us around. We liked the gates, the inner courts, and in particular the women's enclosure. If traveling indepently I'd highly recommend a guide here. Hue is great for those who like culture and history. We're told Hoi An is better for shopping."
"We went here because it is one of the primary historical things to do in Hue. The architecture is beautiful and parts were under restoration when we visited. To see how the former royalty of Vietnam lived was great, and it really gives one insight into the history of Vietnam. A definite must when visiting Hue."
"This grand city in which the King lived is very imposing. The 2 moats and the grand buildings would have been breathtaking in their beauty long ago , although they are pretty good now. The opera house is stunning and the other buildings are very ornate. This is a definite must visit place in Hue."
"Great to see, hear and learn about the Vietnamese history. Restoration looks to be very authentic and it was a pleasant excursion. A big day on the feet though"
"This place is huge and although extensively damaged through war and weather, sections survive and sections are being restored - conveying the grandeur that once was"
"What an interesting place to visit while in Hue, I was lucky enough to be on a guided tour through Vietnam so had a personal guide take us through the city, however I’m sure you can navigate without. Depending on your interest you can spend a good few hours here but make sure you wear comfy shoes! As there are temples and places of respect within make sure to wear modest clothing or bring items to cover up easily."
"Very much on the Citadel is continually being rebuilt as well as restored after the different wars and decay in the aftermath of theirs, though it's still got much more than enough remaining to give a sense of the grandeur and spectacle of the area."
We spent half a day here but we could of spent days there. The history and stories are amazing. If you can manage it get a private guide as the extra information you get is well worth it. A must see when in Hue
"This is a must see place to visit. Not old by European Castle standards (Most buildings from 1800s), but is big enough to lose yourself in for a few hours. Combination of old ruins and new rebuilds/restorations (many buildings destroyed by French and American Wars), temples, government buildings, emperors residences from the Nguyen Dynasty. Visit the Long Corridor for info on all the emperors, some ascending as early as 8 years old!
Would recommend you visit with a guide as not a lot of information available and very few information boards on site.
Highly recommend a visit here."
"A really interesting place to visit, and a good way of learning about the history of Vietnam and seeing some of the photos from its history from the Vietnamese perspective. The Citadel area is extensive and includes excellent artifacts and gardens. We really enjoyed visiting this fascinating place."
"Comfortable shoes are a must. We had a private tour operator and the guide was wonderful. We had walked for too long up and down steps in the sun, and so when it came to the 12th emperors tomb, and the amount of steps, we gave up. The food at the lovely restaurant we stopped at for lunch was good too. A very good tour. Very informative."
Probably the most interesting site to visit in Hue. You need at least half day. It can be very hot so go early !
"You can purchase tickets at the imposing Ngo Mon Gateway. Don't expect an immaculate set of buildings, the ravishes of war have seen to it that only a handful of main buildings remain intact. At least its protected as a UNESCO site now and parts are being restored. That aside there are many interesting and beautiful historical parts to explore, and navigating the crumbling walls and foundations of buildings was part of the appeal for us. Its steeped in history and you'll need time to digest it all fully to do it justice."
"This seems to be the main attraction in Hue, located just over the river from the more popular and touristy area of the town. It took us about 30mins to walk there and then we spent 2-3 hours there but could have easily spent longer! Costs 150,000d each, more if you want a guide. There’s a few stalls and cafes inside but prices are higher so we recommend you take your own food and drink with you! On the whole, good half day out!"
"we spent at the Hue Imperial city at least 4 hours walking around and wondering about the amazing gates, paintings and decorations, temples...we recommend the coffee place at the Emperor’s mother’s house (just a coffee, no food selection) and a visit definitely in the beautiful Co Ha gardens. it is very hot during midday so make sure you take a hat and a long sleeved light top! it was only open until 5:30 pm but we heard there are
times when the city opens until the evening - we would recommend to go later when possible to avoid heat. best way to go back to the center is to take a rickshaw!"
"Large and some areas need maintenance, not many people there and quite peaceful wondering around.the gardens are nice and some lovely bonsai trees."
"You can do all these here at Hue, sightseeing the ancient king of Vietnamese's living palace. antiques, histories, culture, and a great view. perfect for photo taking and a pond of water lily~"
I loved seeing the citadel and all of the Chinese influence. There is some information in English. Some of the buildings have been rebuilt so one can get an idea of how it might have been. If you want to take pictures with the nice light as well as beat the heat then get there early in the morning.
"A wonderful morning spend in the Imperial City. No fees, unless you go into the Royal palace. Did not see everything. One feels a bit overwhelmed by the it all. Have good walking shoes on, and enough space on your camera's SD card."
This site is amazing this historical site is definitely one to see and I only wish I had more time to spare.
amazing place so much to see dont get ripped off by the rickshaw drivers from town centre to the citidal 100000 dong for the hour
It is quite large. Should take an umbrella with you as it can be really hot. The buildings there are similar design to each other. Old rustic charm. Recommended. A bit empty in some furniture inside but for normal traveller it is ok
"Spent about three hours here around the imperial/purple citadel, plenty to see but a little short on information in some areas, if in a group might be good to hire a guide. Very hot in the middle of the day so try to get there early and combine the visit with a tour round the imperial tombs. Buy a combo ticket for all the attractions you wish to visit, the tickets can be purchased at any of the locations for all locations eg tombs+citadel."
Part of the history of Hue. From ancient times to the more modern history of the Vietnam War. The wider citadel is best explored on a motorbike or rickshaw. A must see.
"Take the time of yours and devote an entire day here. There's a lot more to find out than the hurried tours enables you to. You will find places to have a bite to eat or maybe a cold beverage, and wandering the additional overgrown areas actually provides you with a much better taste of this considerable sight."
"The citadel it’s beautiful, super easy to get there, very close by the city center. Great visit, it gives you a great perspective of the imperial Vietnam. The complex is huge, but full of amazing corners and constructions.
Highly recommend!!"
Nice place to visit when you are in Hue. Vietnam historical place. You can spend here a half of day.
"Amazing buildings, great landscapes! Even if you are not agret fan of architecture and/or history, it's THE place to visit before leaving Hue!"
"We bought the Citadel and 2 tomb ticket package, but were not informed that they were incredibly far apart, so it ended up being quite the adventure getting between the sites. Also, there is limited posted information at the sites so we were left wondering a lot (a guide would be helpful for sure). The sites are undeniably must sees, but would recommend arranging transportation (renting scooters or pedal bikes) and doing some research ahead of time. Definitely a great thing to do in Hue though."
"Its so worth the money to visit here, the imperial palace is huge and so beautiful. My husband and I spent several hours wandering around here. Because the grounds are so huge the place feels quiet and in some areas you feel like you have the whole city to yourself."
My Backroads (biking company) tour group booked us a private tour which was wonderful. The history is long and amazing. A must visit.
"If you only have one thing to do in Hue, it’s to visit the citadel. Not old by European Castle standards (Most buildings from 1800s), but is big enough to lose yourself in for a few hours. Combination of old ruins and new rebuilds/restorations (many buildings destroyed by French and American Wars), temples, government buildings, emperors residences from the Nguyen Dynasty. Visit the Long Corridor for info on all the emperors, some ascending as early as 8 years old!

Few points for improvement, could do with more boards for information on buildings. Could also do with a re-entry ticket for the same day, once you leave that’s it, and there’s plenty to do just outside the walls such as the antiquities museum.

120,000 VND pp to enter, can spend an hour or half a day here."
"Very impressive Kings Palace but not that old. 1805-1945( so our guide said)
It seems interesting that around the time we in the west had cars, telephones and the beginning of the cinematic industry - the Vietnamese were still quite bound by tradition. Lovely to see the old photographs and learn the yellow roof is the Royal colour.
The area is quite run down and apparently was bombed by the US during the Vietnam War. UNESCO doing a great job on the bits which have been renovated."
This was a great thing to see. The size and richness of the place is mind blowing. At the same time it was sad to see how much was destroyed during the war. On the up side they are working on restoring what they can.
"Set aside a half day and take your time wandering around this incredible Citadel.
There are enough drink vendors around the place that you don’t need to carry too much water, but keep hydrated it gets hot. Some beautiful garden areas with sheltered seating make great spots to sit and enjoy the beauty of manicured gardens, slow moving waterways and blend of intact buildings side by side with bombed ruins.
Temples show a long dead craftsmanship that is breathtaking in both its symmetry and grandeur.
There are lots of guided options available but with the assistance of a map and our Lonely Planet book, we really enjoyed going at our own pace and exploring at will."
A MUST to visit when you visit Hue ! Just... WHAT A PITY that so much got destroyed during the war... but the remnants are ABSOLUTELY worth the visit !
"There are a lot of places to visit in imperial city.

It better to wear comfortable dress since you need to walk around to visit this place."
"It is the Unesco site but very boring. Why?
1/ No activities like shows or Nha Nhac to entertain visitors.
2/ At least some of staff dresses up like kings, queens, mandarins for visitors to take photos.
3/ Electronic cars ride with out attention to walkers.
4/ The walk from Nguyen Hoang bus stations to Citadel is very dangerous due to traffics. Why not turn to walking way?
5/ The local toilets are not enough,not clean and smelly.
6/ Less places for old people to sit down.
7/ During rainy days, the walk is too slippery. Why not clean the moss?

8/ Travelers have to walk out by Hien Nhon gate is too far. The management is just want visitors to use their golf cart.

9/ Golf car is very expensive with price 320,000 vnd for 1 turn/ 6 people.

10/ Ticket booth staff is too slow to write the VAT invoice for tour leaders.
11/ Why street vendors are very active and aggressive but Tourists Management have no action?
Sad for Hue!"
"We had a lovely day at the Citadel. We walked from our hotel on the other side of the Perfume River and spent about 4 hours inside. It is stunningly beautiful and a relaxing, atmospheric place to spend some time; similar in layout to the Forbidden City in Beijing, but more open. Plenty of cafes and places to buy drinks/food as you go round (a particularly nice one in some quiet and pleasant gardens in the NE side). A family of 2 adults and 2 kids only cost 360,000 VND (I can't remember the breakdown, but the kids were very cheap)."
"The imperial city by itself, although it had a rough time due to American bombings, is impressive and inspiring, especially the royal palace.

A video is provided to explain some of the whereabouts of the place, however, apart from that & a couple of panels here and there, the site is lacking reliable contextualization & explanations. We weren't so sure about how to take a tour guide, as we asked how much it would be for 2 & 4 people, and have been (unfriendly) answered that it's only for 2 person because we were a family, which confused us.

It is kinda sad because such a great site would be largely improved by some mediation.

Oh, and don't eat there - the ""local food"" snacks (specialities from Hue) was not fresh at all."
"If you're going to Hue, you must stop at the Imperial city. There's so much to see. A favourite of mine was the bonsai garden with hundreds of beautiful potted plants in handpainted jars."
"Kind of over-rated y'all! Sorry to do this. It is an incredible feat of history that has remarkably held up, but once going to the tombs in Hue, it is a bit disappointing. You may want to check out the Imperial City before the tombs, if you have time, or consider skipping the Imperial City if under a short time frame."
"Lots of information on history and lots of walking. We visited at 8am, but already was very hot which tired us out easily."
Although it was 40 degrees in the shade we still loved our visit to the Citadel. If you are even vaguely interested in history it's a must see. Not a tourist trap at all. Many areas still being rebuilt after the American War bombing but what is left and been rebuilt with help of UN and German govt is beautiful. Be sure to look closely at many of the photos on display which tell great stories. Two hours was enough for us due to the heat but you could easily spend half a day here. Just walking around the outside of the citadel is a lovely thing to do as well and you'll get fantastic photos.
A really must visit area in Hue. The imperial city was built according to Chinese standards . Be sure to have a guide with you in order to understand all the details about the many buildings inside .
"If you get a chance to visit this as the sun sets, I recommend it, The place is huge, with a Vietnam flag furled out over it, just beautiful. The citadel is lit up (purple when I visited), very cool! Looking to the west for the sunset was great!"
"Just across the river from the tourist side of Hue. Entrance fee is 150,000 dong. It is surrounded by a Mozart and is a sprawling complex with a lot of buildings and gardens which were for the use of the Hue royalty. Unfortunately due to bombings/hurricanes not much remains of the original buildings, but some buildings are being restored. There is a craft shop inside the citadel where you can buy souvenirs made by local artists. Also a few stores where you can buy drinks."
You could spend a whole bay visiting this place. It is huge. So much history. The home of the ancient kings of Hue. A lot of this citadel was destroyed in the American war and some is still being rebuilt. I did enjoy the gardens. It was such a hot day (it mostly is) it was very tiring with so much walking. Wear good walking shoes. I wore a sleeveless dress as it was so hot and you needed to cover your shoulders to enter some buildings. This is a must do in Hue.
"The Citadel in Hue is a very interesting complex, even if it was heavily bombed and part of the constructions are no more visible. The large green space, the trees and flowers, are conferring peace and made it an ideal place for relaxing. I went there alone and spent five hours!"
The Citadel is well preserved- compared to the Ancient town in Chiang Mai for example. The outer walls and the moat give you a sense of the history and the struggles Vietnam has had. It’s a large area but easy to walk around. There was a lady making incense which I had never seen before.
"This is an incredible site; while some of the key buildings were bombed by the americans during the war, there are still many standing buildings that are amazingly well restored and that tell the story of the many kings and royal family members that lived here. The grounds are extensive and there are various different gardens and ponds with beautiful vegetation.

While I was there, they were building up a gorgeous bonsai garden to the back, when it's all done, it should be stunning to walk around.

This place is best explored with a guide who can tell you about the history and the relationship between the different buildings."
"I came to stay a month in Hue and loved this city very much. People are friendly and nice. Foods are so good, especially Bun Hen that I love the most. Don't forget to taste Bun Bo on Ly Thuong Kiet street as well.
The night shows on Perfume River are also so lovely. Highly recommend Hue to all travelers!"
The most interesting things were the state room and the long walk with the details of the emperors so not a lot to go there for.
"We spent more than two hours here. At first it might look like a bunch of building with fade away colors and mosaic out of broken pottery, but walking around for a while you discover that each side doors lead to different palace and each is unique. One have pools and bridges while other displays beautifully carved roof with gleaming mosaic. The place offer a lot of shade which is needed during warm and sunny days usual here. There are few kiosks or snack bars around, though the prices are double of those outside."
the restoration has been well done but there is lots to go. We had a guide and I found it very helpful as he was able to explain the relationship of the different buildings and the stories of some of the inhabitants. Well worth visiting but allow at least 2 hours
"I definitely recommend visiting, it’s amazing! Everything inside is breathtaking! And I wouldn’t recommend going with a tour, it’s super easy to get to and it cause nothing to park or sometimes it’s maximum 10 thousand dong! You can buy a ticket outside but they also have combo tickets you can buy, so it’s cheaper cause you get entrance at two tumbs also!

Definitely recommend going!"
Well worth the visit and the time on your trip. Took approx 3 hours for us to do and many gorgeous heritage sites and temples to see within the City. Take lots of water and be aware you’ll probably get lost or at least confused on where you are or have been too. Only downfall is lack of English signs and/or maps to help explain your way around
Only managed to take a photo of the lighted main door as we visited at night. Was misled by the various websites online that the citadel will be open at night since 2017 but turns out they are not. Left feeling disappointed and wasted our entrance tickets which we bought in the morning when we visited the tombs.
"I visited Hue in a private car from Da Nang ( private driver and nice car for the day- 75 US dollars). The remarkable Citadel was one of the places I visited along with two of the Royal Tomb complexes and the Jade Emperor Pagoda overlooking the Perfume River. My return to Da Nang took me on request across the stunning Hai Van Pass, one of the world’s great scenic drives. The Citadel was the site of a major battle of the Tet Offensive and it is amazing that so much has survived. It is smaller than the Forbidden City in Beijing but it is still a vast complex with plenty to see. Absolutely essential visit."
"Wow what a place this is... the scale of the citadel is almost as amazing as the history behind it. We had local guide Danny from Hue Vacations show us around and so glad we did. Very knowledgeable, helpful and interesting."
"Although not as big as as the Bejing forbidden city, it is similar in the landscape and architecture.

Would suggest a full day to it if you are interested in the small details. If not, probably 2 hours or so would be sufficient. Visit to near by Market is a good experience too.

Remember to bring umbrella and drinking water.."
"The citadel is such a beautifull place, it is still under heavy works to restore it after being bombed by Americans and some works are a little too muche over restoring it maybe, but some buildings and the spaces are to visit while. Walking between them. You can't visit it if you are in hue"
"Can skip if you've seen similar in China or other countries.

This is a major attraction in Hue, but unfortunately it's not much and we struggle with all the hype or how beautiful it is (?)

There's not much else in Hue except this and the tombs, but it was a nice short stay t discover the town, food, and people. I am glad we didn't build our whole agenda around Imperial City."
"A outstanding website to check out when visiting Hue. The Imperial City was once the house of Emperors trough centuries, this's the location where they were living with their servants and family. The site 's areal is aproximatelly 700 square meters, dealing with the Perfume River of Hue. An essential section of the Citadel is damaged, but there's always enough to find out! (I suggest you to pay aproximatelly 1½ hour in the Imperial City if not more, since it's really and unforgettable experience)"
"Great tour of the Citadel. Remarkable place, so big with so much information and history inside the walls. Really enjoyed the visit"
"Loads to see and read up on within the citadel. A very interesting place to visit. My children, 13 and 10 weren’t too interested in it but enjoyed the shop!"
"Huge complex, wish there were more signs explaining things. Kind of just walked around aimlessly. Could spend a half day here just admiring the buildings.

Also note the bullet holes on the walls, signage of history."
"Huế city in central Vietnam was was the seat of Nguyen Dynasty emperors and the national capital from 1802 to 1945,Lots of history,this is a very historical site, for the Vietnamese people.Beautiful decoration, you are able to learn about most emperors of Vietnam,dragon boat ride, pagoda visit, Citadel and two tombs"
"I have not been to the forbidden town in china, therefore this complex is absolutely amazing. maybe the one in Beijing is able to rival it. it's grand beyond words. it's unfortunate most of the place is flatten currently due to bombings during Vietnam battle, although the most decorated building is hundred % intact. it's unfortunate that they're attempting to rebuild everything from scratch. it covers the actual history, but on the other hand, parts of dull land do not tell a lot, also."
"Large grounds. Lots of history. Lots of old pictures.

Recommend that you at least read briefly its history prior to visiting.

Bring wide brim hat and water. Oh.. and feed the fish!!"
"The restoration work seems to be going very well. This is a very large complex, and there is much more of it than I expected (having read the history of how much was destroyed in the Vietnam War). You get a real sense of what it must have been like to live as an almost god-like emperor with all the hangers on and retinue that it would include. Could have been here for longer than we were (c. 3 hours).
Missed the virtual reality offering, but I heard it's worth it."
"This has a lot of meaning to me, considering I am a Vietnam veteran. Although I was not here for Tet, there is a lot of relevance for me. I walk in here and feel my hair stand up. I can visualize the fighting. It is being reconstructed at this time, but the beauty of the buildings and grounds are absolutely beautiful. There is a wall that will never be touched again. This is a historical wall, you can see the bullet holes from the war, this is to show generations to come about the war. I also found a couple of other places where the bullet holes are.
This is a very historical site, not only for tourists, veterans but for the Vietnamese people.
In some of the buildings you are not allowed to wear hats, shoes and definitely not photographs. It is just respect.
There is also a place where you can dress up as a king, queen, prince and princes and sit in a throne. Pictures are allowed and you have people making sure your outfit is appropriate for your pictures.
I will say, this is a must in your trip to Vietnam. Make sure you have plenty of water and comfortable shoes."
"Grand entrances befitting Kings.Citadels within citadels undergoing constant renovations.Wars futility nearly destroying this Forbidden-esque city of Vietnam to the world.Well worth a visit,Kings reading room and Purple City a highlight."
The place was of immense historical value but after carpet bombing from US in the 70s everything was torn apart. They are constantly reconstructing and it is definetely worth visiting. Gets really busy after 10:00 and make sure to try the Korean ice-cream when exiting the ruins.
"So worth while visiting the citadel. It is modestly renovated, not very busy and really a tranquil and lovely place.
In principal it is very similar to the For bidden City in Beijing, minus crowds, shops and frenzy.
The photographs of American soldiers in the citadel during the war, the fighting and the before and after shots are really gripping."
"It was really nice to go there, it's a beautiful citadel and there is much to see of the vietnamese Culture! I would say it's not a must on your travellist but it's really worth it if you are already in Hue."
"Must explore and do if in Hue
Instead of boat request for a cyclo ride to Citadel.

Worth every minute spent"
"Most likely if you went to Hue, you were keen to visit the citadel.

You will not be disappointed. It is larger and much charming than expected, less flamboyant thank thought.

Half day visit seems a good time to spend there."
"The Palace is definitely worth visiting, yet the Emperors & their gear aren’t especially impressive. The location would have been more impressive if it hadn’t been wrecked in the US war."
"This's as a miniature of Forbidden City found Beijing. Beautiful decoration, you are able to learn about most emperors of Vietnam. The interior of the palace isn't really well kept, we had been there on a rainy morning and the majority of the hiking paths are slippery. We're a comfort shoes to hike within."
"Fabulous trip starting with dragon boat ride, pagoda visit, Citadel and two tombs. Lots of interesting photo opportunities. Some good cover if weather hot/cold."
The citadell is much more interesting than I though it takes several hours to see all buildings and the nice garden! In the end even the Emperor appeared just kidding it was a local Vietnamese dressed a as a Emperor for a nice photo. Almost all the buildings were well maintained some were under renovation. There were a lot of pictures on the walls from a vanishing time! A lot of furniture and music instrument were on display.
"No need to write too much about this one as the Citadel is a part of any Hue guide book. We were amazed during our whole visit, too bad the restorations were going on at the Mon Gate so it was not open to the visitors. Definitely a must see. Tip: go see the gate during the night as well, there‘s almost no one at the premises and the gate is beautifully lit up!"
"Really interesting place. Lots to see, lots of history and nice calm feeling. It is huge though. We spent 3 hours there easily including a visit to the pavilion surrounded by koi carp, drinking juice out of coconuts. Highly recommended."
Certainly worth visiting this historic place and taking the VR (Virtual reality) experience we did it all for £3 each person!!
"Hue Imperial City is very impressive and huge (>500 hectares). We were given a tour of buildings which were restored but there were many buildings still under restoration.

The imperial city shows the scale and grandeur of ancient Nguyen dynasty. You will need 1 day to walk the whole area but we spent about 1 hour here."
"I had the enormous good fortune to be on the tour with a young man from Hanoi, who was very generous with his knowledge of the history of the Citadel. With his help, the place came alive, was nowhere to be seen, the history and prevailing customs were engaging. I want to come back when the restoration is complete."
You need several days here just to understand the history of this majestic place I need to go back again
"Suprise after got the entry ticket, nooothiiing to visit there, we were very disappointed. We walked all arround about 3 kilometers just for some old photos."
"Interesting piece of Vietnamese history. Spacious so a good outdoor excursion even for warmer days.

Need to dress/act appropriately a d respectfully so may not be the best place for energetic young kids who want to run around...."
"I came here on a guided tour and do think that is the best way to do it otherwise you would be missing out as there isn’t really much information as you go around.

I didn’t find it too busy as was easily able to wonder round with the group.

Think we spent about 1.5hrs here which was enough.

Good to get an understanding of Vietnamese history."
We chose to not join a tour and just explored on our own. Stopping when we wanted and using wifi to find out more historical data. We loved the princess garden in queen mothers garden. Miniature replica of nearby land. Kids found it cute to explore within. Good arts and crafts nearby. Take ur time. After few drinks ended up 5 hours there
Tickets are 150k dong each which seems like a lot until you realise just how huge the site is. I highly recommend taking the Lonely Planet book as they have a great guide which helped us understand what everything was - the reason for 4 stars not 5 is that there wasn’t huge amounts of information about to explain each building. The historical significance of this place is enormous and so interesting. You can still see the bullet holes! Incredible to think the site was left in ruin as the restoration work has been fantastic. An absolute must visit. Ensure you leave at least 2 hours to see this site.
"A must view. Buy a combo ticket with the imperial tombs - check which tombs you want to visit. Late afternoon seems to be less crowded than before noon.

The museum pieces are nicely signed in Viet and English."
"Be careful, I just stayed inside the citadel something like 10 minutes, I followed a way and I took a gate.

3 or 4 meters (its not a joke about the distance) after I understood it was an exit (it was writte nowhere front of the gate) I wanted to return inside but a man from the security told me I couldnt take this way and I had to go to the main entrance.

I tried to explain him during 3 minutes I just didnt know it was an exit but he couldnt be able to speak more than 3 words of english.
When I tried to go to the main entrance they explained me they couldnt do anything for me, that I have to pay an other ticket if I wanted to go inside.

To be honest I'm really disgusted about what happened there, and it' sur just another exemple about how they always try to cheat with the foreigner, it make me sad for vietnamese people who try do well"
What a beautiful place to visit. I recommend you to hire a Guide as this is part of Vietnamese culture. I learned a lot about this place and how every emperor changed culture.
"It's simple beautiful, a great historical site and really worth a visit and peaceful experience. The visit can be better with a local guide. Worth a visit"
"Sad to see so much destroyed in the war, but great that they're rebuilding. Lots of good information around the place too!"
Nice place to walk around and experience the grandeur of past times. It takes at least 3 hours to discover the citadel but one can easily wander around for 6 hours.
Wonderful highlight of any trip to Hue. Probably best to set off early to avoid the intense heat of early afternoon....
"I first passed by this ancient complex in 1969 in much different circumstances. Little did I know the history within the walls this beautiful group of buildings held.
I am fortunate to have been able to return 49 years later and spend time viewing the history that has been so beautifully preserved in this ancient city."
The citadel is well worth visiting ...and it is very interesting. We enjoyed learning about the history.
"Definitely worth a visit if you like a bit of history. Which Hue is an important part of Vietnams history. The imperial seat. Well looked after. Definitely save a whole day. 1/2 day for the actual citadel itself. Bring an umbrella as it can get hot. Ticket entry at the gate. Our tour guide bought the ticket. We booked through our hotel- Villa Hue. Car pickup ans drop off for the 3 of us. We wanted the ease of travel and wandering and being able to do it at our leisure with my 76 yr old mother in law.

We found it particularly intersting for photography.
Our tour guide spoke very good English and did a good job with the local
information.

We’d also recommend maybe a electric drive around the citadel first, then you can walk around and discover the places that interest you.
You but the electric car tickets inside the citadel, it’s separate to the entry fee. We do suggest it for young families or with older ones as you can do a lot of walking. This way you can enjoy the scenery and then choose which places you want to visit in the actual ancient city after."
Lots to explore. It's in a state of renovation so you can see what was and what's to come. Wear comfortable shoes if you walk the whole thing. Well worth it.
"The imperial citadel is absolutely beautiful. The buildings that remain are intricately designed and decorated. There is so much history here! I highly recommend arriving right at 8 am (or a little earlier) to ensure you see the changing of the guard, which is quite the show. Also, check out Hoang Thanh Phong’s gallery, where he sells his original artwork. We bought several of his paintings!"
"The Citadel is beautiful! The building itself is full of details, has a very nice architecture. It’s a big complex of houses and little temples, so be prepared to spend at least 2h for the visit."
Great to get some glimpses from the past. It is quite a large area although it may not seem so. Allocate at least 2 hours if you want to have photos all by yourself. They close at 5:30 pm so make sure you get there in time.
This place is great for history lover since it will tell you alot of story about the kings and kingdom that ruled this city.
"Beautiful, impressive and full of history -the Royal Citadel is what you have to see when you’re in town! Bring a fan and some water on hot days and in most of the temples you can’t have your shoulders or legs above the knee showing so to save some hassle tying shawls around yourself I’d wear trousers/a long dress or bring a scarf if you don’t have these."
Would recommend seeing this with a guide to being the stories to life. Fascinating insight into the King’s life and rulings.
"Such a nice place to visit with a lot of history, nice gardens and architecture. Kinda steep entry fee, but still worth it."
"A lot of places are closed, they are far from each other and almost every time you see the same decorations or just a simple rooms. Very disappointed. The only thing worth to see there is throne chamber. Still not worth 150k. Really see pictures on internet, round it with bike, see flag hill and go somewhere else."
Came here with small kids and loved it architecture is gorgeous probably most impressive City we’ve seen in Vietnam. Well worth a visit we both the combined ticket to see two emperor tombs as well and would recommend that.
"Very impressive buildings, well worth the visit. We did not take a good in which case some more information in English would be helpfull."
Outstanding historical treasure and heart of the city. Beautifully laid out. Great for riding a scooter aroynd perimeter including under the wonderful historical arches.
"This happens to be a small regret since the place has been beautiful and it is well worth exploring for hours, really a picnic in case the climate is perfect. And so in case you are in Hue, simply hop in a taxi and go right to The Citadel. You simply need to spend a fee of 55000 dong to get into so go ahead, enjoy yourself."
A visit to the Imperial City is essential for any Hue visitor. The city is part of the Citadel of Hue complex. Although badly damaged by war with the French in 1947 and later by the Tet Offensive in 1968 there is still plenty to see. It is said that out of 160 buildings only 10 remain as a result of the damage sustained during the Tet Offensive. It is now an UNESCO site and there is ongoing work to restore and preserve parts of the citadel. There are many historic photos within the complex that show the citadel as it was in the past. You can also get dressed into traditional royal costumes and pose with props for unique photographs
"Obtain a Cyclo and also check the interesting, forbidden city, it's a gem, can't think the Americans bombed it inside the 70s, the gaps are still there and it requires global attention to be fixed and brought to the former glory of its, and glory it had been!"
Asia does ancient architecture like nowhere else. Although the imperial palace is not completely restored it is a site of great beauty. The majesty of what was is clearly evident and photos of the past give a telling story of days gone by. The surrounding gardens are verdantly beautiful and a fabulous position to watch and imbibe the ambience of times present and past. Well worth a visit.
"A very impressive historical site. This was a beautiful place to visit. You can see the battle between nature and the restorers. Moss and lichens, some damage from the war, and beautiful architecture with regal touches ( yellow tiles to signify the presence of the king). This place really suits photographers as you can wander at will and the scenery is classicl."
"We really enjoyed our morning visiting the Citadel. In design, it was similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing, albeit samller. It was interesting to see the different buildings and sections and our expert guide gave us all the history and intrigue of the Citadel through time. Aspects of it are still being re-consructed. A must when you visit Hue.
Enjoy."
"Very interesting, incredible that all those temples and official buildings have survived many attacks over time. It was a bit rainy in mid january when we visited, so bring a water proof jacket. we brought some plastic coats and it was perfect to walk all over. We bought the guides that are sold inside, they were useful and the price was fair."
"We quite enjoyed our walk through The Citadel, the old pictures throughout help to imagine what it was really like. Huge area of grounds to wonder through."
Really interesting - take a guided tour to get all the history and intrigue -lots to see and learn -
"The citadel is very beautiful and there is a lot to see. Be sure to allocate several hours for experiencing this if you want to see everything.

The only drawback was restoration construction work taking place everywhere. This is more than okay, and should in fact be this way to preserve the place, but they are not good at covering up the work sites, so it looks messy a lot of places, which is a real shame."
Quite expensive but at the same time something that should be seen if you come to Hue. Not very impressive but if you bring i Local guide i guess it could be quite interesting!
This is definitely an impressive landmark to be visited. I can say that it is the primary place that you should visit on Hue. It is a great symbol of Vietnam history.
This is a stunning place I highly recommend it. It is better if you pay for a tour so know about the history.
A must see even though large parts are in ruins. try and wander round and see as much as poss as most congregate in the main building
Main parts of this world heritage website are unfortunately falling two portions by damage and that is very unfortunate to experience. Especially when it was helped getting renovated by UNESCO but presently there appear to be no one around who'd be interested of holding it up. Unsatisfactory!
"The imperial city is amazing! We loved to walk around at our own pace .... there are a lot of shadow places to walk and sit to enjoy the beautiful surroundings! Entrance fee is 150k VND .... cheap for half a day of fun! Big plus: once you are within the walls, street sellers are not bothering you anymore. There are plenty of stops where you can buy drinks/food"
The Citadel is a must see when in Hue. There is an abundance of historical buildings on this large site and it was beautiful to wander through. I particularly enjoyed seeing many school groups.
Entrance fee was 150000 vnd per adult. Although mostly reconstructed due to war damage still quite stunning. Well presented displays giving insight into imperial life. Little cafes and shops dotted around inside. You can spend hours here if you want to explore it’s entirety.
"It is the first place you should try to come in Hue city. I traveled with my son who is 6 so he did not enjoy it much. The weather was hot the other day too that made us feel a bit tired.
However, as a person who love to know about history, I love to see the throne, the place that king lived. The scenes there are quite quiet which made me feel a bit sad though.
My sone love flying a kite outside the Citadel. The price for a medium size kite is 4-5$.
Price for entrance is approximately 7$ for adult. Free for children under 7.
You should wear pants/ jeans or skirt that cover your knees, shirt with sleeves to enter some certain places.
Bring a hat is helpful too."
"Had ever last capital of whole Vietnam for over 140 years. Undenied this is a last one of a prosperious city. It takes you some hours to explore all buildings (palaces, temples, gardens,...). Walk around but anywhere is green color. That is diffirence Hue and Beijing palaces. Lovely, well decorated and skillfull for a whole. It deserves!!!"
"The Imperial City is quite larger than we thought it would be. Give yourselves plenty of time (at least 2 hours) to walk around and explore. We had a guide with us which was nice because we learned so much about the history and events which took place here. Had we walked around on our own, we would have missed out on a lot of information. This is a truly amazing place to visit!"
"This should have been a truly spectacular site to visit and it does still retain some of its original splendour but it was severely damaged in the Tet offensive so many parts are completely destroyed. They have managed to restore some parts and continue to work on others,"
"A lovely visit to the citadel - unfortunately we selected the hottest day of the hottest month so our visit was cut short because we were just too exhausted to continue.

The expanse of the buildings, gardens and lake is enormous. A worthwhile visit (perhaps just not in the middle of summer)."
"One could easily spend 30mins or 3hrs here - your choice and there is a lot to see.

I hired a guide for this aspect of my trip to get the most out of he visit is relatively a small amount of time - I pleased I did.

The yellow roof - Kings colour
Bullet holes in the entrance as recent as the 1960’s

Yellow lotus flowers being picked for personal use or sale.

Stroll to look at the library. The history of the Kings.

The arts and the shear buildings.

Free wifi - no
Family friendly - yes
Drinks and ice cream available - yes
Pay to get in - yes
Sings in English - yes
Flat walking shoes required - yes
Suitable for all ages - yes
Wheelchair accessible - yes but you my have some difficulties.

I entered from the south end and exited at the north end and then headed up to the next tourist site."
"Was a rainy day when we visited, however full of some cool buildings and architect, would be worth a visit."
We went to Hue to get the feel of the history of Hue. Our tour guide help us get the feeling of the history of the old kings and the historic sense of being the former capital of Vietnam. Very interesting to experience Hue.
"This is a huge area, so worth starting the day early
It can be warm so please remember your Vietnamese hat :-)
Have a travel guide book for the area explaining what you see, and walk on your own. Soon you will discover that it isn't crowded at all."
"Just a quick visit with guide. Ok, but there on a wet day so rushed through. History interesting but don’t need a long time"
"I have traveled to some famous places in Vietnam like Hanoi and Saigon, but Hue brings me a different feeling. it seemed like the pace of life here is much slower, and the people are elegant, not as active and dynamic as a big city.
The Citadel is beautiful, reminding me of the citadel in Chinese movies.
And foods are amazing! there are lots of foods and snacks, and they are very CHEAP! It took only a few dollars to make my stomach full."
This was a highlight on our trip. It was just beautiful. I could only imagine what it would have looked like and what it would like after restoration.
"In my opinion, to get the most of the cultural experience of this citadel is to have a guide. Steeped in history it is an incredible journey back in time that we can only imagine."
"A nice place to see with historical knowledge to be known. First time to be here, we have walked a whole day. So many beautiful views but still a lot of places have been fixed yet not ready to be visited. However, we got a very bad experience here when trying to buy some coconut water. We only asked but the man selling drinks in front of the theater were extremely annoyed and even yelled at us.
Still one of the most important place to visit if you are interested in Vietnam's imperials."
Very interesting place to visit. Some many great views. The size of the goldfish or carp blew my mind.
"Increadible beautiful place
No guides despite the fact we paid for one
Great for kids and family too"
Main tourist attraction in hue and all must see.go early and take water and a hat.we do hope the restoration works are given the priority they deserve so we can appreciate the original splendor it once must have been before the war damage
"This was a really very charming collection of buildings that formed a much larger complex in ancient times, however the structures suffered from bombing in the Vietnam war.
What remains is really excellent and there are many buildings undergoing restoration. the whole set out of the land and the way that the royal Families with their entourages were accommodated is fascinating to behold and you can close your eyes and imagine life as it was in those days.
The courtyards are exquisite, the connecting pathways and the details around them are really beautiful to behold.
To really appreciate the buildings and the grounds you can easily put aside between 2 and 3 hours and even more of you just use a guidebook throughout.
the grounds are immaculately kept, the walkways and paths are very clear and with a small map you can easily navigate your way throughout."
You can easily spend 3 hours walking around here so a good place to spend an afternoon. It looks a bit run down but equally it's really interesting reading the information on the previous rulers and some of it is very pretty
"Decent enough place to visit, was in a guided tour (8 people). Hot day made it a bit of a struggle. Very interesting in part, but somewhat repetitive."
We took a taxi from our hotel to the citadel and then walked through. It was quiet interesting but was rather neglected. Unfortunately all the information signs were in Vietnamese and so we did not understand the history of the citadel. It certainly was interesting though.
"Was really looking forward to this place in Hue. Not well maintained (grass is dry) and plenty more interesting and beautiful places to visit while in hue. It comes as part of a package ticket which made it better. If you only have one day in Hue, I'd recommend going to different pagodas and the martial arts performance."
"There is a total lack of signposting, there are no guide books or maps available. There is a map at the entrance showing vaguely where to go. Most of the Citadel is under construction. There are many pictures, but this is not a museum. I am a history lover and there is little information of interest other than ""This is a picture of the emperor entertaining guests"". The architecture is worth seeing though."
Not to be missed. Very interesting history and peaceful experience. A break from the bustle of the city. Bike tour a must but you need to hold your nerve and trust the other road users to miss you - which incredibly they did!
"Spent an extremely enjoyable morning checking out the complex. It's an enormously complex, with a lot of it severely damaged throughout the Vietnam War. But nonetheless you will find some lovely old buildings/temples around. There's a beautiful cafe at the North Entrance where one might have a drink and people watch. We ended the journey with lunch at giving Lac Thanh joints."
"Sorry, may attempt at humour.
The citadel is lovely, well preserved over a large area, interesting if you like that stuff. I personally don’t; one pile of bricks compared to another forms a lovely relic but lifeless."
Wonderful location with lots to see however I feel there was a real lack of information. I spent all my time on Google.
A wonderful and extensive walled palace reminiscent of the Forbidden City in Beijing. Crossing the moat and walking through one of the imposing gates one enters into this extraordinary closed-off world of the Hue emperors. Badly damaged in the American War the complex is gradually being renovated. Much has been done but much still needs to be done. It is a brilliant place much greener than its Beijing equivalent and somehow more personal. A guide is vital for the 10 square kms of this site. This is an absolute Vietnam must!
I just wandered around this complex of beautiful buildings. I arrived at four in the afternoon and by five the place was feeling quite empty and atmospheric. It is simply beautiful
Picked a really hot day for a walk around with a lot of concrete and not much shade. The visit was worthwhile I thought given the read of commentary from Lonely Planet guide to explain what was what. Photos of war damage and restoration was interesting. Worth a visit!
"You will want to spend at least a couple of hours exploring this complex. They are still working on the restoration, as much was destroyed during the war.
Remember your sunscreen and camera."
"this is the first place my husband, my daughter and i visited in hue ... it is a huge place so be prepared to walk. each piece of architecture has a story to tell. take the time to imagine how the place was during its glorious years.

there is also a place to have your photo taken in imperial costumes. they also have for children. not very comfortable but it was fun."
This was a must see and I was not disappointed. As we were travelling in July this was not peak tourist season so it was easier to get around. It is a big site but there are cafes and refreshment areas inside. Some beautiful buildings and interesting history. I will not o into too much detail as you will have to see this .
We visited the also known as the Hue Forbidden City in a very sunny and hot day so it resulted a very tiring experience given its large size. The place offers very interesting areas so it is important to note that close to the coffee shop after the entrance there is a golf cart service that provides a much more comfortable alternative to strolling.
"This place is stunning but massive. It would take hours and hours to walk. around. We went in July so the humidity and heat were intense. In order to avoid too much walking we took the rickshaw option and negotiated an hour's tour. They took us to places we could perhaps have lived without and only at the end of the time took us to the royal palace complex.
Beware though that even after negotiating a price some of the drivers were aggressively asking for extra money at the end of the time! The other thing to be aware of is that we weren't dropped off where they picked us up and we got hopelessly lost. Fortunately we contacted our villa rep and she gave our location to our driver to come so he could come and find us. Having WiFi helped a lot with this kind of issue."
"Its a definite must to visit the citadel. Tickets cost 280K VND including a visit to two tombs.

The place was bombed and repaired however many parts of it were destroyed by the Vietnam war.

It is like a mini version of The forbidden city in Beijing however much of this was destroyed. It’s great to visit here and see history.

Your time will be limited by the heat and it’s just so burning hot here it’s not funny. Water and ice cream can be bought inside at the shops"
"We went to the Citadel on an extremely hot day which made walking around quite a task.
However there is a lot to see in the citadel, I would recommend buying a tour book or getting a guide as its quite hard to know what everything is without this."
"House of Nguyễn
Hue Citadel. Imperial Palace for 13 kings. Nguyễn Dynasty (1805 to 1945/ Fédération indochinoise 1887–1945.) The last Nguyễn Emperor to rule went into exile in France after abdicating to Hồ Chí Minh. Palace beautifully adorned with dragons, phoenixes, unicorns & turtles. Familiarity between Hue Citadel & The Forbidden Palace isn’t missed."
This was one of the places on out Asia tour. This looks like a military fort made of stone and brick with a moat around it. There are several parts to it and to do it justice you need 2-3 hours in the hot Vietnamese sun.
"Really interesting place. We went as part of a tour which I think helped, I would recommend going with a guide because the signage wasn’t always very informative."
"I've to confess that I anticipated a thing more... likely very much. the citadel is an enormous portion of Vietnam reputation, but after 2 wars is paying the bill. I actually liked the digital reconstruction, government granted to hue, at least it provides you a concept of the tremendous things you may have bought in the past here. I believe they must treat a little more, likely organizing more fascinating guide tours."
"Ancient buildings, lovely roofs, history and beautifull gardens.The visit can be better with a local guide"
"Spent just over a hour here. Walked around in very hot weather. The buildings were very interesting, mostly in ruins. Cost around 150 d to go in."
"We visited here yesterday and it was 38c but felt like 48c so we stuck to the tree line to try and stay out of the sun a little. The place is Hugh and quiet interesting, but it's not well maintained which is a shame because it must bring alot of money into the country. Suggest that when you get there plan which way you will go because it is so big, just after you enter the 1st building there is a plan, mini model of the place. Entry cost is vnd150,000/person and you can pay for a ride in a large golf buggy."
"The citadel is mostly in ruins. Some interesting buildings tho. Guides from the citadel itself are not worthy. We get one for another 150.000 VND and the woman tolds us no more than the basics you can find in any guidebook. She was rushing through the place, barely could speak English, and try her best to make us buy something. And after this 20 minutes of unpleasant touring she tries to get a tio out of us, claiming that the 150.000 VND we paid to hire her goes for the government. Of course we didn't tip her at all. Incredible."
"This is truly a lovely historical site. The Imperial City majesty could be felt in every step to the historical city! Clean, cool, great ambience and lovely rich history makes this place a must see, must not miss place! You feel transported back to the Chinese influence of Vietnam throne and similarity to Chinese Emperors influence and lifestyle. Rich in history!"
"We had 1 full day in Hue and it was 41 degrees. Took a taxi from Saigon Morin hotel. We got a tour guide at the entrance which we paid extra for ( I think 150,000 VND). Guide took us around for an hour and then we had time to wander ourselves. Some maps or a guide book would be helpful. Fantastic site and insight into the imperial Kingdom.
Hotel told us to make sure we got our museum tickets. They are included in entry but at a separate site. Entry and exit not clearly explained. Entrance at the front and only 1 side exit open. Save your feet in the heat.
The museum had many antiquities, unfortunately no photos allowed. There is also a separate air conditioned building on the museum site with information on the Champa history."
"The taxi dropped us off at one gate and the driver told us he would be waiting at another one. I think we were there for just over two hours, it is a big place to look around. There are tours inside using golf buggies that zip around, but it is pleasant to go at your own pace. There are a couple of cafes selling cold drinks, cakes, some food etc. Make sure that you either take or buy plenty of water as they as only by a couple of entrances and when yu get to the middle you may be thirsty...I took a photo of the map layout when we went in which proved useful as we wandered as it is easy to get confused as to you exact location and so the way out !"
"Despite the humidity and temperature around 40 degrees, we enjoyed the tour. So much to see, lots of information in English, shade and a couple of places for drinks and snacks. Well worth it."
"We booked a driver for the day who took us to see some of the tombs near Hue. The tomb of Khai Dinh was pretty impressive - the 'guardians' look reminiscent of the Terracotta soldiers. I also persuaded the driver to look for the abandoned water park. Although he found the main entrance with no problem, the 'security guard' there tried to tell us we couldn't enter. However, as a group of backpackers were leaving from the side entrance (found after a 15 minute walk) they told us he didn't look like the ones inside so we walked past him. It made my day to see the massive dragon overlooking the lake. Fantastic!"
Good to visit. We went on a very hot day but lots of shade around. Lots to see and no pressure from locals.
"A nice visit to the Imperial Citadel. Modelled on the Forbidden City in Beijing, the Imperial Citadel in Huế is nice to see whilst not being as impressive as Beijing. That said, it is a great way to see the imperial history of Viet Nam.
In some areas of the complex, taking photographs is prohibited."
"The Imposing fortress like structure takes you back to another time period, and our guide explained how different entrance doors were used by different ranks of people."
"One of the places of interest included in the 3-sites combo entrance ticket was the palace and citadel which looks like Beijing's forbidden city. The price of the ticket was VND280,000 and expired in two days. Be prepared to walk a lot as the area is very large.

Too bad many of the major structures of the royal palace and citadel were destroyed by the former French imperialist. We observed heavy Chinese influence in the architecture and design of the building like many dragon sculptures etc."
"This place was truly amazing. Even with around half of it under repair when we went it was spectacular.

You will need half a day to view the site properly, probably more once the repairs are complete.

The sheer scale and the gardens were the hightlights for me."
Awesome place to spend some time soaking in the history and surroundings. Take your time to visit all sections in this beautiful place. Take note that some areas are going through refurbishments.
"Very large complex so be ready for plenty of walking in the heat. Currently mid refurbishment ( will take many years to complete given scale) but so many worthwhile buildings to visit and explore. Recent history and role in Vietnam war also compelling including lots of visible bullet holes at main gates. Enormity, length and layers of the wall structures made it a formidable defence for this ancient city."
"Amazing but unbelievably hot! No aircon or fans so be prepared. Water, shade etc. come early or late. Beautiful city and incredible history. We loved it and wish we had more time to explore."
Very large area. The day was super hot but was an interesting location. If you’re in Hue it’s a must do
"The large scale of the site is excellent and those buildings which were rebuilt and restored certainly are a hint of what was previously. Unfortunately a lot of the spot is overgrown with relics of days gone by under the lawn. Aside from the Korean clip using a computer produced reconstruction of the site, info is sparse, there have been absolutely no manuals and couple of English signs. Refer to an excellent guide book prior to going."
"Nice place to visit in Hue. A wide area which takes you 1-2hrs to go around and take photos. Entrance ticket price is 150,000 vnd but if you buy ticket to visit 3 places (Imperial city, Minh Mang tomb and Khai Dinh tomb - which are 3 most beautiful places in Hue) the ticket price will be much cheaper, just 280,000 vnd for 3 places per person."
"I wasnt particularly impressed but it was nice to walk around for an hour.

It might be more interesting if it was managed a bit better, we were told there were no maps, and there were no signs explaining anything or even saying what things are. Id recommend taking your own guidebook of the place or hiring a tour guide if you want to get more out of it.

We did also go on a fairly overcast days and I suspect that like everything, it looks better with clear skies."
We did not enjoy the Imperial City. I think it was mostly due to a lack of guidance in terms of a map... Maybe if we had a guide it would have been better
"What a wonderful spot to check out. The majority of the buildings had to be rebuilt after the American battle, though they're currently painstakingly rebuilding towards the city 's original glory. Take good walking shoes and also go off the street. You are able to walk all day long and still not see everything."
Excellent great food.so much to see.the citadel n tombs are exquisite.great to spend for a couple of days on your vietnam visit
"The grounds of the citadel are very large, with a range of buildings and exhibits to see.
There's also a small shop, and a costume photo service.

There's not a lot of cover or shade so be prepared to get hot."
"We walked through the city with a local guide, which was cheap and highly recommended so that you get the full picture. An amazing glimpse of the rich history of this amazing country. You can almost see the emperor and his concubines in this place!"
"To do justice to this interesting and extensive site you should allow two to four hours depending on your level of interest in things historical. Best to go in the morning when the temperature is cooler. The site is easy to navigate (a site map is provided at the entrance) and if you want to visit everything it involves a lot of walking. Alternatively, you could remain in easy walking distance of the entrance and still see a multitude of beautiful buildings and fantastic art works. At night laser lights shine from the top of the citadel - spectacular. Tip: It is very difficult to get transport if you walk from the entrance to the opposite side of the City. It is a one way street and there is nowhere for taxis to stop.Better to do a circular loop and leave from the front entrance."
"We spent at least an hour walking around the Imperial City and really enjoyed our time there. It's very interesting and even has a TV inside the grounds with an informative program on the grounds with English subtitles. One thing you should be aware of is that, to actually see the palaces and the main grounds, you do have to pay 150k entry. Again though, this was well worth it for the experience."
"It does have a few interesting corners and spots here and there. However, it lacks the majestic feeling compare with the forbidden city in Beijing, or the delicacy and intricate detail compare with the imperial palace in Kyoto."
This place is huge and unfortunately buses are not allowed anywhere near the entrance gate so a lot of walking is required and in the scorching sun that ain't easy. It would be great to visit on a cool day. The scale of the place and outer walls is quite large. A lot of the inner buildings though are in ruins.
Interesting attraction but it looks to me it still need a look of work to restore or even maintain the place. Overall must visit site.
"Hue Is a town with many historic buildings, in the Center of the city Is located one of the most important historic place of Vietnam, the imperial city, which is like the forbiden city in a smaller scale, some buildings has been reconstructed and others has been repaired. The ticket price for an adult is 150.000 Dong. Inside some buildings pictures are not allowed. I recomend bring water, temperatures in Hue are very hight."
"We enjoyed our visit to the Imperial City. It is nowhere near to the Forbidden City in Bejing as some have compared it to, but we enjoyed the tour. It is however the hotest town in Vietnam!! You have to do a lot of walking here as no big buses allowed, take a cold towel and umbrella for the sun and lots of water."
"Hue is an ancient imperial city. is full of rich history of the Vietnamese monarchy.
Beautiful photos! The city is definitely worth seeing.
You need a full day to see the city. I was in October, it was a very hot and very humid weather, it was almost unbearable in the afternoon, I do not recommend a visit with young children."
"This was the capital of the Nguyen dynasty for 150 years until the mid 20th century and it is apparent with all the splendid architecture that this was somewhere special.
We had a guide and it is worthwhile having one to help understand the history of the building and the dynasty.
There is inevitably some damage from the war and whilst restoration is under way, that will take time. It doesn’t, however, detract from the splendour of the buildings.
It is worth spending 2/3 hours here"
"This is the former imperial capital of Vietnam from 1802 until abdication in 1960s. Massive complex with many buildings in good shape or being restored. Some buildings were destroyed in the war. Truly a sense of history. Take your walking shoes. If walking is an issue, there are electric carts you can hire-- but not sure they can go everywhere in the complex. We spent three hours here-- and could have spent more time. Highly recommended."
Fantastic full of history you can imagine the imperial family living in the places we loved the old magnificent buildings & statues. It’s not to be missed.
Definitely worth seeing if staying in Hue. We spent a few hours in awe of the amazing infrastructure. The highlight for me was the huge bonsai garden!
A must visit palace in Hue...u need to Walk alot. But u can use buggy too. The building is so antique n nice
"If you wish to learn something about the Citadell, you should hire a guide. We made a mistake of not doing that and we did not learn a lot. There are some information tables available, but in hot and humid environment I really had absolutely no wish to read them.
It was a nice stroll, got some nice pictures, fed fish. I would really suggest to hire a guide."
"Spent almost an entire day at Citadel, the imperial city of Hue. Took amazing pictures around the place. Was very worth the money we’ve paid. Go with time and be prepared to walk a lot. Nice local restaurant outside the place!"
"A peek into the world of Vietnamese royalty. It is not as well maintained as other nearby sites, but the bloodiest battle of America's Vietnamese war was fought here, resulting in a great deal of damage that required restoration. Take time to view all the photographs that are on display throughout the citadel."
"You always wonder if you will be throwing away money going to a tourist site. Not this time, my friends! What a fabulous site. Just hauntingly beautiful. Bring water. Wear a hat. It's gonna be sunny and hot. So many things you will want to take pictures of throughout the Citadel. do not hesitate to go."
"This attraction in Hue was super cool. It just happens to be the main thing to do in Hue so there are people everywhere. We showed up as a group of 4 around 11am and we had a chance to take photos without people in them (rare at tourist spots these days). When we left at 2pm we ran into a wave of tourists coming from other Hue attractions that are often part of package tours (the tombs etc.).

We loved exploring the history in the old city like the personal reading room for the emperor and the extremely old photographs inside the Citadel.

The price is 150,000Vnd to enter, a heftier price for Vietnamese attractions, but a cool exploration. Be sure to bring water, stay hydrated and protect yourself from the sun. There are places to buy beverages and the average price of a drink is 50,000Vnd."
"The citadel deserves time, so take your time and wander at your leisure. The grounds are huge and you cannot do it justice by tearing around in an hour or two. Half day minimum"
My husband and I spent about an hour walking the grounds of the Citadel. We could have spent much longer. The gardens were beautiful and there was lots of history to explore and read about. Beautiful place to visit in Hue.
"Interesting area, some restored, some not. History is of note and some parts quite attractive. It’s a must if in the area, but unless reading all the exhibits, half a day is sufficient. Note the saving from buying combo ticket if planning also to visit Any of the royal tombs"
Today we did a 2 hour tour of the Imperial city with a group of 4 . A fascinating history lesson of the emperor and how he lived in his large fort.Well worth the visit one of the top destinations in Hue to visit
"Soaked in history, see the bonsai garden and forbidden city. Really interesting, still being rebuilt so the guides have heaps to talk about 👌"
Few people were visiting which was amazing. Very beautiful and peaceful. Lacks proper explanations but other than that pretty awesome.
This is a very impressive 19th century royal residence... This was quite a quiet place for me. It felt like I was in a different world. It was a very grandeur place though had been damaged by the war
"It's a big forbidden city to walk around to get a sense what it was like long time ago. We took the transportation offered (VND300.000) for one hour with stops. For those who can't walk far, it's an option. Some of buildings are in bad shape but some are still in good condition. Overall, an enjoyable visit."
"We paid 280K Vnd for the combo ticket (the citadel & 2 tombs). We also paid for the guide (100-150K Vnd). The guide made all the difference. She did rushed us a bit though, so she can earn money with other guests I guess. Regardless, it was a really good experience."
"We spent 2 or 3 hours and it's 100% recommended.
The entrance fee is 150.000VND, one in side you can get an idea how was it many years ago...
Some areas are in reconstruction and others are forgotten, but the most part is in very good condition."
"Really torn about whether this is a good visit or not. The entry fee was 150,000VND and to be totally honest I was underwhelmed. The main hall is nice but beyond that it gets a bit dull. There was some nice architecture but a lack of information (presumably to make you pay the 300,000 for a guide) Also many of the buildings aren't original, some less that 50 years old but it looks like they've been left to get dirty so they look older. They don't, they just look very poorly maintained from the outside. Maybe we should have got a tour guide to learn more about it but really it wasn't as gripping as expected. Shame had high hopes for it being a UNESCO site."
"The Citadel in Hue, the former imperial city, is definitely worth a visit, BUT you need to allow some time (2-3 hours) to do it as at first you may think it's just ruins ... If you are not on guided tour, there are many good references on-line."
It’s a big place to visit with lots to see so recommend a good 2 hours. It can be very hot but they provide buggy’s to whiz people around from place to place but I think you have to book it. We walked which is doable but at a slower pace. Worth the visit.
If you are visitng the city of Hue then this site should be on your list of places to visit. If possible you should aim to see this complex without the aid of a tour group that will rush you through the site. Take your time and spend a couple hours if you visit here on your own.
"Had the opportunity of visiting the Citadel while on a bicycle tour in Vietnam.
This was a guided tour and narrated by our guide.
I would suggest a guide for the Citadel as there were a lot of nuances that were not explained on the displays.
Very warm, but a must see if you are a history buff.
The price is cheap(even with a guide).
Definitely worthwhile but bring water as it can get hot in the palace - no AC."
"The weather on the day I visited was lovely. Local tourists were friendly. I'd suggest that you join a guided tour as the place is huge. With the guide, you would enjoy the Citadel more."
"Although the majority of the buildings had been bombed into damages during wars, the machine and remaining restored, and also beneath restoration part of the citadel are still really impressive. It provides a really great historic tutorial and feel on Vietnam really survive feudal dynasty (Nguyen). A must check website for your journey to Vietnam. It will will last in case you are able to read through a little about Vietnam History particularly on Nguyen dynasty prior to the trip. A trip to the citadel is only going to finish in case you mixed the visit of yours with Nguyen emperors' tombs inside Hue"
"We had about 2 hours to wander about the Citadel and we only saw about half. We are history buffs and loved the diversity in beautiful architecture and highly decorated interiors/ exteriors, but also the ruins of a glorious past. The grounds look like they are undergoing restoration, and it is needed, but the authenticity of the place, which has undergone much change in the past 100 years, is still visible and now is a good time to visit if you don’t want to see everything rebuilt and repainted.
We saw the residential area, throne room, theatre area and the long corridors, which are beautiful. Flowers were in bloom which added to this being a must see historic site."
"I went to see history, culture and tradition and it gave all information. Parks were perfectly maintained and crafting on the walls were icing on the cake."
"It was raining hence the palace is very humid. Be prepared to walked for at least 2-3hours or hire a buggy for an hour including 3 stops without guide.

Entrance fee 150,000 for adult and 30,000 for children."
"I entered the Citadel not knowing what to expect and found it overwhelming big and vast, where to start, where to end. The beauty the magic of this place made me want to sit down and contemplate how simple my existence is in this great big universe while at the same time how great it is to be alive. I though of the people the walk this place before me what they looked like how they behaved the lives that they lived. Yeah well worth the visit"
"Very impressive set of buildings and gardens, with beautiful galleries and corridors, incredible gardens and lakes and very beautiful pavillions! Truly one of the great wonders of mankind, to rival the Forbidden City. The citadel and the tombs are visits not to be missed!"
"The old city is quite a nice place to check out. I wouldn't recommend organising a trip just to see it, but worth stopping in if you are in the area. Looking for the bullet holes in the wall was the best part."
"This place is big and take your camera. Its so interesting to read the history and see how intricate the city was. I loved wandering there for most of the day today. Taking turns brings you to new places, small museums, art galleries, and even structures they are renovating."
It was great to see the imperial city/ the old capital of Vietnam. The grounds are beautiful. The architecture and history behind it is pretty interesting.
"We spent most of the early morning wandering around looking at the different displays and simply strolling the justification, it's very relaxing. I believe we will have become more from the experience in case we'd used a good manual, as they will have been able to describe in detail the various websites.
Almost all in all it was an excellent morning and I suggest that in case you're in Hue, look it over."
"What a huge, beautiful and interesting Citadel! So much history to read about here, I learnt so much and I got to dress up as an Emperoress! It was worth the money in my opnion!

Make sure you see the 9 dynastic urns as they are one of the special treasures of Vietnam.

I enjoyed reading about the different Emperors and the legacy they each left.

The craft section was very interesting, make sure to go in each section and read about the special crafts of Hue. I learnt so much!

I love Hue! I suggest staying in the the citadel area just outside the walls within the citadel complex - Purple Homestay was perfect! The loacsl in this area are so so friendly! I stayed one night in the tourist area outside the citadel and did not enjoy that area as it was not authentic Hue. So stay inside the Citadel for the best experience!"
"In May it is hot and humid and rainy, so we wanted to hire an electric car.
These are found after the second building, turn left to a large coffee restaurant. There you will find a table with a young woman selling the tickets. You have to wait 5 - 10 minutes and then the car will pick you up from there. The driver stops at the most interesting buildings, but gives no info.
They offered 40 and 60 min tours. If only with 2 people who have no knowledge/info about the buildings, but are just looking cluelessly :)) around then 40 min is enough.
One is being dropped of at the exit which is not the same as the entrance.
If it was not so hot then it would have been easy to just wander around.
Afterwards (being Dutch) we hired a bicycle and explored the area around the citadel. Quiet streets, lined with trees, many large ponds with water lelies. Old world feeling, worth the effort."
"Vietnam royalty lived here for more than 100 years. Although much was destroyed in wars (with French and US) the restoration is impressive and authentic, especially the big iron cauldrons. A truly forbidden city for ordinary people."
"The erstwhile capital of the Nguyen emperors,this UNESCO site is a huge place,requiring almost half day to visit the various areas within it properly.
The huge walls and most around it enclose the purple forbidden city,which housed the royal family and their palaces.Restoration work by UNESCO has beautified a lot of the damaged areas. We loved the Hall of supreme harmony and the royal theatre with their rich red pillars,along with the 9 dynastic urns in front of the hall.Dien tho residence,which used to house the Queen mother's bears a forlorn look now. The whole area is a mini city ,with a number of gardens and other structures present.

Tips : Go early at 8 when the gate opens.It gets very hot and there are no shades ,so best to start early .

There are also electric cars available on rent which can take you around the important areas for an hour or so.
A must visit in Hue !"
"Did this with a tour and we had the tour guide show us around and it was very interesting to learn about the history of the dynasty and the site - really recommend.
I was there during May so it was HOT!!! But definitely do not regret the visit as the site was wonderful and got some of my best photos of my Vietnam trip from here."
"So much to see in this imperial city! This place is huge and very impressive: walls, buildings, temples, colours, gardens, bridges, etc, etc. We loved it!"
"Very lovely place but many pieces were destroyed during the war ! Quite impressive, worth visiting to understand how the history was being influenced but various countries"
We had a great local guide who explained the history and significance of the citadel. Excellent afternoon.
"So much to see. The Imperial City is enclosed by walls and moat over 2.5 km long and contains many buildings, gates, temples, courts, gardens and much more.
We spent the whole day wondering how it would have looked in its heyday. Sadly the complex has seen better days but it is still possible to imagine the grandeur. There is restoration underway."
The citadel was one of the top attractions in Hue and we decided to make a visit to it. We decided to walk the entire time and was so tired once we were done with it. The buildings inside were nice and well maintained.
"Definitely the top thing to do in Hue, I’m glad we visited. There are sign boards helping you get around however if you are really into your temples and history then maybe a tour would be better. We opted to walk around ourselves and read the sign boards which was good for us as we did it at our own pace. The architecture is old and pretty with a lots of smaller elements of detail. Entrance was 150 000 Dong (about $6.5) so not the cheapest!! We stayed for about 1-2 hours then had had enough so lengthy of time depends on your interests and concentration span :)"
"This's the hold of imperial Vietnam. It provides an abundant experience of times past both modern and ancient. The site shows the connection of emperor, army, and mandarin. It's tough influences to Vietnamese religious heritage, both in shrines as well as the numerology"
"Some of the most incredible ruins we have seen. Historical monuments recognized as UNESCO sites since 1993. Most of the structures were built from 1805-1832, and once were home to the Nguyen Emperors and royal families. Plan on at least three hours to slowly walk the groups and absorb its history."
"Place of great history and very instagramable. However, not very suitable for young kids. Place is huge to explore in leisure but need lots of water and shade to mitigate the heat"
"A visit to the Imperial City usually means leaving either a coach or car in the Nguyen Hoang Car Parking and then walking to the entrance set into the Noon Gate. On the way one has to take great care crossing the moat and going through the City Wall as there is no pavement and there is a great deal of traffic (usually mopeds). After entering the city on the right is a set of 4 cannons under a cover - these are the Nine Holy Cannons (the other 5 are some distance away to the west passed the Flag Tower Ky Dai).

After entering the Citadel proper immediately in front are the two parts of the Thai Dich Lake which is split by a walk way which leads to a courtyard area / parade ground in front of the Thai Hoa Palace. The palace was for receiving (foreign) visitors and although photogenic, photography is NOT permitted inside.

Before going into the palace, the inside of the Noon Gate is well worth looking at closely with its ornate roof, the lake has loads of Koi waiting to be fed and the courtyard has loads of people taking photographs.

After passing through Thai Hoa Palace, there is another courtyard with buildings either side which make up the Can Chanh Palace. Looking further ahead there is the Can Thanh Palace, the Khon Thai Residence & the Kien Trung Pavilion. If time is short these are usually omitted from any tour. Also, near these latter items and to the right is the Ngoc Dich Lake. Beyond the wall at the end are 3 further lakes.

Near to the walls either side of the central axis created by the Can Chanh & the Can Thanh Palaces there a series of Temples (3 to the left and 1 to the right. The corridors which make up the Can Chanh & the Can Thanh Palaces have been lovingly restored in the 9 years since the last visit. Moving across to the west we saw the Thai Binh Pavilion (under renovation) and the Duyet Thi Royal Theatre.

This theatre has been opened the last visit and inside clearly illustrates the musical instrument, costumes and face masks of the period. Most tours will exit via the picturesque East Bastion, returning to the coach/car park walking beside the moat.

Most tours last about an hour but if possible allow half a day as there is a lot to see. Also there was not any leaflets available when we visited."
"So much history packed into this locale, I do not know where to begin. A highlight of our visit to Hue"
"We had a great time visiting the Imperial city. Although part of the city is being renovated, but still what a wonderful visit for a half a day. We just bought the tickets at the entrance and didn't use a tour company for the visit and used a Vietnam guide book to learn more about the Imperial city. The visit took us about 3 hours.

It was also very relaxing to be away from the motorcycles, noise and the crowd.

We are glad that the local government is preserving the history and culture of Vietnam."
It is worth for 1day totally visit Hue Imperial city. We are so impressed with the peaceful scenery here. It took us back to the wonderful piece of history. We wish we can see it before. So many beautiful buildings have been ruined by the war. Worth to visit! Besides we like the paradise of foods and hospitality of the people here. Love Truong Tien bridge and Perfume River. I love Hue city so much!
Give yourself at least 2 hours to tour the city. A fascinating piece of history & well worth a visit. Many buildings were ruined in the war but those restored our well done. Be part of a tour if you can. Very interesting & worthwhile.
"The day we visited the Citadel it was scorching hot, there are pockets of shade around though so you can get some respite from the heat, the area was enormous, with a lot of lovely traditional buildings, some were under repair well worth a visit"
Just one night in Hue. Tired after an overnight train from Hanoi so didn't get there until the afternoon. A suggestion that it closed at 4.30 was incorrect and happily it remains open til 6pm. We had enough time in 1hr 40mins to have a really good visit but maybe allow 2-3 to include coffee breaks and time to absorb. The entrance alone is worth the effort and we walked to it from the hotel area along the riverside in about 15 minutes. Fascinating history set in beautiful tree covered 'parkland'. Make sure you visit the formal gardens at the north east (top right) corner as they are a real delight.
"Although Hue's priceless historical building and Imperial City were badly damaged during the war, as it was located near the Demilitarized Zone, this immense complex is totally worth seeing.
Do go early as it gets quite hot and the place is huge; also take an umbrella/hats to protect you from the blinding sun and heat (you can buy water onsite as well as inexpensive fans)
The Imperial City is much more than the Forbidden City where the Emperors lived. It is a whopping 2 x 2 km area surrounded by a massive moat.
Inside, you'll find a lively and interesting local area, with temples, cookhouses, monasteries, as well as the magnificent Forbidden City. Copied on the Chinese, it housed the royal palace, queen's residence, queen's mother's residence, king's mother's residence, concubine residence, royal theatre, royal library, ponds, covered walkways and so on...Gold and red exquisite rooms, quiet gardens, beautiful gates!
Make sure you have a good guide book!
We actually hired a guide but were dissapointed with his indifference and lack of knowledge. We should have gone alone with a good book to be able to soak in the atmosphere at our own pace, sitting down for drinks by the library pond, for instance!"
"This is possibly the best attraction in Hue. We took a Cyclo from our hotel and he waited 3 hours while we wandered through the many beautiful buildings and temples all surrounded by a wall and lotus filled moat. If need be you can go round by electric car which is great, stopping along the way to enter and view the ancient Imperial buildings."
"Beautiful location. Hopped on with a tour and had a good time.
We had to make it interesting for our kids, because tours aren't really prepared for that."
"Vietnam is our favourite global destination, but despite more than 10 visits here we’d never been to Hue, making this trip’s choice easy. The Imperial City is at the top of the list when you search “things to do”, so away we went.

Entry price was VND 150,000 each, which sounds a lot but when you do the math, A$9.00 for a slice of history (a very big one) is great value. Tickets at the gate and unless you’ve arranged a tour guide, you’re on your own. The place is massive, and the perspective that came to mind was Angkor Wat meets Tiananmen Square with the forbidden city and summer palace thrown in.

Allow at least a few hours to walk as far as you can, read the history, soak in the atmosphere and let your mind wander back in time. Don’t think about the damage that was inflicted in 1947 and 1968, or maybe do. Whatever, but to us, it was a sobering yet uplifting experience. 10/10..."
"There is no doubt to say that the citadel complex has been leaving its beautiful marks in mind of Vietnamese people and foreign tourists. The details inside the complex will definitely bring you back to the time of 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th centuries when many emperors of Nguyen Dynasty were, or the escalating time of the Vietnam War from 1966-1968 - the famous event was Tet Offensive in 1968 as well as how are local people in Hue and UNESCO trying to maintain the complex.

Because of its size, you should prepare couple of water bottle and training shoes. More importantly, it would be better if you go with local guide/ tour guide who will share the flow of history.

Strongly recommend it to everyone!"
"Awesome experience, lots of history, beautiful buildings, lovely gardens. Recommend visiting this site."
The grounds are really beautiful. We didn't do a guided tour but we did see them. I would skip it. It's extremely hard to hear and understand the guides for the most part. You get a real sense of history and definitely shouldn't be missed when visiting Hue.
Great place to visit. Lots of restoration going on still. But the money you pay goes into that. Not too many signs for English readers. We didn’t have a guide so if you want to have more info it would be best to hire a guide. We were fine looking around ourselves.
It was very interesting to know the story of the citadel and once you are there you hey a great picture of how things were in the past. Well maintained buildings and clean everywhere around. The e-cars were great for a very hot summer day.
"Must see place, however with so much war damage difficult to imagine how it was.
Poor signage & explanation, really need to up their information to keep the visitors informed.
I know they need money to continue renovations, but we feel the entrance fee to high to see mostly broken tiles and weeds!
This site can and I'm sure will, one day, be an extraordinary educational visit, just not there yet!"
"Bring some sort of shadecreating device. Being a portable black hole oraybe something more wearable like a a hat or an umbrella because the sun is gruesome over there. Ok the sun is the same but the walls block any form of wind whatsoever.
We hooked up with a guided tour after asking the guide if that was ok.
Great sight to see although almost everything had to be rebuilt after a couple of wars. Impressive maquette of how it used to be and the emperial shrines and thrones are impressive. The kids liked it but they enjoyed visiting the abandoned waterpark alot more. Best to do both imho, like we did."
"This is a must see if you come to Hue. Not expensive. There is a lot to see, it’s an impressive site."
If you've been in Asia for a while you've probably seen a lot of places like this before. It's nice and very big but not very well presented.
"Although we made use of a guide which helped our understanding enormously, we thought that the restoration, preservation and renovation here was fantastic. Along with the information we had read and gained from our tour guide we were able to imagine what life would have been like and and how it would have looked. UNESCO are still working here so it is likely to get better."
Old imperial buildings and artifacts were very impressive. However the whole area was badly cared for. Lots of rubbish and generally messy. Would be amazing if it was given more care.
Beautiful and big place to visit. Can stay here for all day for walking and read the history about Vietnam.
"A visit to Hue without visiting the Imperial Citadel would be like going to Beijing without seeing the Forbidden City. Beautiful architecture and gardens. Lovely to walk down the covered walkways and examine the beautiful lacquer work. Can be very how so bring an umbrella to keep out of the sun when you're walking around the gardens.

One criticism wold be not enough information about the history of the citadel, when it was built, it's development etc."
"We visited the Citadel as part of a private guide Tour. We found it to be a fascinating place and well worth a visit.

To get the most of the history of the place you need a guide but not sure if you can pick one up when you get there so worth checking out before setting off."
I am keen on discovering historic sites. This is one of great place I have ever visited. The architecture was nice with impressive view. Know more about Vietnamese history and have a visit to a river nearby. Recommended.
"A must visit location when in Hue. On the other side of the Huong River is the massive Imperial City. There is a modest entry fee.

You could spend a whole day walking around and many people do. Or you can opt for a shuttle service for 45 or 60 minutes. You will then see some of main sites in a much shorter time frame. It’s going to be hot so come prepared.

I thoroughly recommend exploring the Citadel."
"This is worth at least half a day. It'd be interesting to wander from corner to corner, seeing the different displays and buildings and gardens and altars, but I'd recommend either bringing along a written guide or researching the structure ahead of time, as the information provided is sometimes incomplete. You can see everything from a royal theater (still in use and with good exhibits on the music and theater during the imperial era) to mostly destroyed remains of the forbidden purple city to the audience hall of the queen mothers. I could spend all day looking at the walls of a gate, embedded with unique ceramics that are works of art in themselves and that together create an impressive impact.

Many of the structures include gift shops along with their displays. Although this could come across as tacky in most contexts, I found that it enhanced the experience (even for a non-shopper like myself) as the displays were subtle and many of the goods appeared to be high quality and unique to the structure's context - we didn't see these kind of items on sale anywhere else in Vietnam."
We went to the Citadel on foot hounded by offers to go by boat which we refused and walked ourselves. Once inside we were again approached by offers to take a rickshaw tour for 200 000 vd an for an hour. But we were given the impression it was a flat rate and it would only take an hour. As nice as the experience was were were very annoyed that the tour took two hours and we spent a whopping 800000! Our friend were told a price also but the price changed when they talked to their friends and found out we paid more?!? How rude! Don’t be duped! Otherwise it was a good trip and we enjoyed the information. We recommend do you own research and catch a cab!
"After wandering across the river and following the steady stream of visitors to the Imperial City, we wandered through the front gate...then spent 3 hours peeking through archways and doors, and discovering more and more lovely buildings and shrines. It felt like Narnia, as new courtyards opened onto unexpected gardens. It was lovely, if a bit short of English explanations"
We explored the ruins of this wonderful monument. Really recommend you take a guide who brings Vietnamese history to life.
"Our guide took our group to visit the Citadel in Hue. The citadel is located on the bank of the Perfume River & from the 19th century. The Citadel when in its prime was comparable to the Forbidden City in Beijiing. It was since been damage when the Vietnamese took on the French in 1947 & by the Vietnamese war.

If you're truly interested in its history, it's best to have a guide or else, you'll just get some good photo ops."
Bring a camera come early as it get hot as heck around 11-12. Expect to not come out the same way you went in. The walk is lengthy to get out but the visit was worth it 100%. Entry fee 150k. Worth every dong.
"The citadel is a must for anyone visiting Hue. Make sure you have either a guide, audio tour or map because it’s a very big beautiful place. You could easily spend an hour walking around the beautiful Chinese inspired citadel."
What a fascinating journey into the Vietnamese past. Its high so take your time. Wear a hat. Bring water.
"Took several hours to see almost all of this site. Be forewarned that during the hot season like in May, the humidity can be stifling. A great insight into how the royalty had lived before the communist government took over."
"Although it was close to being destroyed, but still a beautiful place. We didn't get to explore too much due to chilly rain in March, but what we did see was nice.

An informative video was playing and it was good to see the 3D realisation.

Good tip would be to bring an umbrella or snag a raincoat from the resort's desk. Otherwise prices rise when it rains.

Sellers not as pushy as at some other tourist places.

By the way, please refrain from commenting about it being modelled after Beijing's forbidden palace etc.

With Vietnam being part of Indochina, i suspect that's what happened. They were definitely in a different financial state from China during that part of their history as well.

But we don't need to rub it into the tour guide's faces. I heard a comment right next to me from a tourist: ""Wow, this is so small compared to Beijing. Looks very similiar too. What's the difference? It looks like a copy"" and i could see the tour guide's bright face fall because they are proud (and rightly so) of their heritage and country.

So come on people. I know we're a well travelled community so maybe we can try to be sensitive to their feelings? Be kind."
"After active Ha Noi, Hue was extremely relaxed, particularly when you finally obtain in the Imperial City... in case it is sunlit carry a picnic. We'd an incredibly knowledgeable guide, who discussed everything about the citadel's reputation and really enhanced our expertise of this appeal. Way that is good to spend the morning."
"Should have visited this first... then I would have said. W O W?.
But having seen Forbidden City Beijing, first, this became a let down/ disappointment.
Because the former is more extravagent in every way.. rooms, space, fit out etc., on seeing the smaller version, it was just Ho hum... sorry Vietnam.
But as said previously, see this one first... then the other, and it will have more significance, and you will enjoy the sights of historical Vietnams royalty."
"The Citadel is massive in size with many beautiful gardens and buildings. The complex is over 1,000 acres. The quality of building materials and scale is impressive. 30,000 people worked for 27 years to build. Unfortunately many buildings including French styled structures have been lost or were destroyed when the French withdrew.

We recommend adding a tour guide to your ticket for 150,000 Dong. Wonderful history of the last 13 emperors and the lives of women at the time."
This was an interesting place with a lot of history. Unfortunate that some areas /buildings were bombed in the war and the areas cleared away. There are no ruins to show where they were. It is good to see UNESCO putting money into restoring the buildings that are left.
"Place nice and if you are staying in Hue, i think it is place you should see. Area is big, so it takes hours to look all the places. Also, notice, there are rules what to wear when going inside some places. Ladys NO tops so take something to cover your shoulders. Also bring water! If you dont like to walk, you can take electric car for extra charge. See prices from the picture."
"If you go to Hue, this is a must see. We spent most of a day there, exploring the historic citadel, temples, emperor's residence, library, etc."
This is an interesting place to pass a few hours and is a must if in Hue. Lots of ongoing building so that does take away from the experience.
"Great place to see history with a lot if information available.

If travelling without a tour guide note that if you plan to visit other mausoleum or tombs can get ticket that covers multiple places rather than the more expensive individual ticket prices"
"The place is quite big, but there are not many buildings to see as they were destroyed. You can easily imagine the former greatness of the citadel."
"We booked an electric cart with driver (not a tour guide) for the Citadel as my partner was having trouble walking - and this is a large complex. If you have mobility challenges or it is just too hot to walk, you can pay for an electric cart (may want to look into reserving) after you enter the complex. The residences, temples and historical displays are well preserved and informational. My favorites were the gates, adorned with broken tile to create beautiful mosaic art and the gardens of flowers and bonsai. There is a small craft area with artisans painting and making paper flowers, sewing, etc that is attached to the gift store. Minimum time needed 2 hours and can spend up to 4 - 5 hours here if you linger."
Really enjoyed our visit plenty to see and excellent value for money. Berry easy to access short walking distance from the town.
"We walked to the citadel, not really sure what to expect. But as soon as you see the flag flowing high across from the grandiose Ngo Mon Gate, you know you are in for some historic treats.

We walked around the Imperial Enclosure for a few hours, mainly looking at the gardens, the ruins and the palaces from the outside. But even so, it was well worth the ticket price. Inside the imperial enclosure, there is no hazzle of vehicles, except the few electric tourist shuttles, so you can just quietly wander around.

Bring water, as it is ridiculously overprized in the citadel and surrounding street vendors. And make sure you head for the Ngo Mon gateway, as this is the only entry point. We were told by cyclo drivers to go up to the east gate - apparently they were more annoyed with our refusal to go with them than they let on, as this caused us a 10 min detour. There is only exit from the east gate!"
"I thought this place was really interesting and well worth wandering. It is huge! And I thought it was pretty cool that we were walking down paths that emperors had once walked and where wars were had. Yes it's a little run down but a lot of the buildings have been restored or are in the process of being restored, I thought it added to the place seeing buildings that were still pretty incredible but built in 1800s."
"Quite an interesting place to visit, a lot of work still to do to restore it, but already a lot to see."
This was my 5th visit to the citadel. It was busy and overcrowded due to Hue festival. It is definitely a must visit attraction in Hue. I recommend to visit the citadel early in the day or late afternoon to avoid crowds from tour bus. Lots of restoration are going on at the Citadel at the Moment .
"Have been here many times, one tone, one different thing. I treasure every moment I am here, I am going to leave but all these thing have been in my mind forever. I love Hue."
"We spent a full morning walking around the citadel and it was beautiful. We were lucky and had great weather that day. The citadel is huge! You could spent all day walking around it. Lots of lovely gardens and temples to visit, definitely recommend a visit while in Hue."
"Hue is the former capital of Vietnam until 1945. The city is once a battleground for Vietnam War, which is the longest and bloodiest battles. Before the French invaded the city and the battleground of TET Offensive in 1968.
The Nguyen Dynasty (1802-1945) Emperor Gia Long (Lord Nguyen Phuc Anh) built the Citadel in 1805 and completed in 1832 by Emperor Minh Mang his san. A large complex 10 kilometre circumference surrounded by the moat and a stream. It comprising of three enclosure – such as Kinh Thanh (Capital Citadel) with ten gates, Hoang Thanh (Royal Citadel) 600m by 600m by 4m and 1m thich wall, Tu Cam Thanh (Forbidden Citadel). This is one of the must-see UNESCO World Heritage sites in Hue recognized in 1993. Others site are Thien Mu Pagoda, and the Royal Tombs of Nguyen Kings along the hillsides along the Perfume River. However, the most visited are by tourist are - Lang Minh Mang (Minh Mang Tomb), Lang Khai Dinh (Khai Dinh Tomb), and Lang Tu Duc (Tu Duc Tomb). Although the Nguyen Dynasty had 13 kings but only seven reigned until their deaths and have their rest place in the valley.
The Imperial Citadel - The Imperial Citadel is surrounded by the moat, the four outer wall is one meter thick, and 600m in length and five meter height. With 10 gates with watching towers along the wall. Most of the Forbidden Purple City has been destroyed during the Tet Offensive in 1968. Inside there are the Royal Palace. It has four elaborates gates – Ngo Mon (noon gate), Hoa Binh (northern gate), Hien Nhon (eastern gate) and Chuong Duc (western gate). You normally will enter the imperial city through Ngo Mon where the ticketing office is. It is also call the south gate (noon gate).
Walking in through a bridge is the Thai Hoa Palace which is the emperor’s administrative centre where he have audiences with the members of the royal family, the civil and military mandarin. Walking through the palace is the Forbidden Purple City – the emperor and the royal family reside here. It was completely flatten during the Tet offensive of 1968. There is a Mandarin Hall now for photos in the traditional emperors’ costumes with a fee and a museum with exhibits of silver, wood, bronze and calligraphy from the Nguyen Dynasty. A Royal Theatre on the right (under restoration at time of writing) with has some custom performance at interval. Behind the theatre is the emperor’s reading pavilion. On the western side there are temple for worshipping such as Thai Mieu and Phung Tien is the temple to worshipping on the emperors of the dynasty. The Mieu is very well preserve and dedicated to the shrines of the nine Nguyen emperors. In front of the The Mieu is an elaborate pavilion lined with Nine Nguyen Dynasty Urns for the worshipping the Nine Emperors of the Nguyen Dynasty. Weight about 2,500kg. Each represent an emperor of the Nguyen Dynasty and casted during the Minh Mang’s reign. It is crafted with motifs of the sun, moon, dragon, mountains, rivers and scene of daily life. In the middle another Urns 3m height is to honour the great contributions of the first emperor of Nguyen Dynasty Emperor Gia Long"
"This is a huge place to visit with quite a lot to see. Plan on a morning or afternoon at least.

Be aware leaving the site is a fair walk from the entrance so take at least 15 minutes into your calculations.

A good number of stunning buildings, small lakes and pools, topiary, statuary and a wealth of photographic evidence of the past to see along with golden carp and catfish (which the kids will surely live feeding as much as the fish like being fed). We missed seeing the traditional song and dance advertised.

Some parts may be quite inaccessible to those with difficulty walking. It can also be quite daunting walking through the tunnels in the outer walls with moped and other vehicles beeping their way through. It seems drivers in Vietnam believe a horn beeping gives them right of way whichever side of the road they’re on and the loudest or most used the better."
"There is plenty to explore here, with many impressive buildings. We spent a couple of hours taking it all in."
Highly recommended.It is the must place to visit in Hue.The city had been damaged during the war and was made a UNESCO site in 1993. The buildings that still remain are being restored and preserved. The city was still very impressive. Exploring the city take 2-3 hours for me.
"We walked to the imperial city and spent 2+ hours walking the grounds. There are a few buildings to visit, all quite similar to someone with no idea of the culture (sorry!) but not a huge amount of signage in English.

That being said, the buildings are pretty, and its nice for a relaxing stroll of an afternoon"
"Must have been badly damage during the war, there not much left to see. The restoration work are slow. Nothing really much to see."
"This is a big site so be prepared to walk or book onto a tour that takes you ride in a little cart. Lots to see, beautiful buildings and gardens. Well worth a visit and needs a couple of hours to do it justice."
"To be 100% honest, it was disappointing. We were recommend to come here by our travel agent and we still have no idea why, made us question why we bothered staying in Hue to begin with.

Very expensive, even by western standards and surrounded by people who will try to scam you.

Don't even bother."
"Pleasant four hours walk. Interesting history. They've a lot of reconstruction to do after it was heavily bombed by the French then the US led UN forces. Huge area, must've been so impressive at its height."
"We bought a package ticket which included three tombs for 360,000 vnd each. Luckily we made the decision to do the Citadel on the second day as it is a huge site - I think we were there for three hours! There is a lot to see, both in the gardens and the displays inside the buildings."
"Interesting and worth seeing. Best to have a knowledgeable guide with you, great stories of past kings and empire"
"Much bigger than I was expecting, well worth seeing in my opinion. there's gardens, small lakes, lots of various buildings and couryards. a theater and museum and various other things.
Well worth spending a few hours to have a look around"
"We were on a tour from a cruise ship, and the drive to Hue was itself and experience; passing fish lagoons, paddy fields, Buddhist burial grounds., mopeds and motorcycles by the score, and utterly mad drivers that made you blink at the reckless overtaking.
However, when we got to the Imperial Palace, it was well worth the trip. The Imperial City is an amazing place within the Citadel. There is much to see and you do need a good guide to help you get the best of it. If you love such places, then give yourself plenty of time because it's a big place."
You cannot go in Hue and not visiting the Imperial City. We spent an afternoon there. If you want a guided tour be aware it is only available in English (and obviously Vietnamese).
"Nice place to visit. We went there in the morning, and our driver couldn't find a parking place since there were so many tourist buses there, so we came back in the afternoon, less crowded. I highly recommend to rent a cart with the tour guide. There is a lot of walking!"
"A must visit, no doubt!
Be careful about purchasing certain items in the souvenir shops inside the citadel as they may be overpriced."
"Great site , gorgeous grounds on arrival, beautiful to see but if you have walking difficulties please reconsider as it it quiet a walk if not prepared , wear joggers and comfortable clothes"
"Loved walking around the citadel. If you're into your history from different parts of the world then this is a must if you head into Hue. They're currently doing a lot of restoration works so it will be great to see what it's all like in a few years time.

They had a small demonstration of music and ritual outside the palace where the tombs of the royal family are which was good to see. There happened to also be a small school group there which were eager to say hello to friend and myself so that was a nice touch to the visit.

Walking around the grounds is also quite peaceful when there aren't too many tourists around and the colour of decorations within some of the buildings is a wonderful sensation for the eyes to behold.

We only had time for the Citadel but I would have liked to see the other 2 compounds around the city. That'll be for the next trip."
"Wonderful set of old palaces and temples set inside a series of fortress walls and moats. Badly damaged during the war, much has been done to bring these buildings to life. It is quite a large area, but for me, well worth taking the time to explore. On entering, after viewing the central courtyards it seems to be best to take the tree lined road to the left ( beside the cafe ) and to explore the temples and gates in a clockwise direction. Beautiful gardens, great mosaic work and lots of pictures and information of the Nyugen Dynasty. After leaving it is easy to visit the splendid museum building down a lane, opposite the exit gate, which is free, and holds some fine furniture and relics of this era. World class experience ( for a culture vulture )"
"Even our teenage boys where impressed with the scale and depth of the citadel.

So much history crammed in to this large sight. A must do in Hue.

Spend a couple of hours exploring. Turn left or right don’t just explore the centre."
If visiting here it helps if it is a bit overcast as walking around in the heat is a struggle. Plenty of history but alas plenty of people. Would suggest a good guide and an early start to avoid the mid-day heat.
The ancient city is amazingly filled with history. Wear good walking shoes and plan to spend some time studying the beautiful mosaics and very old buildings. There is even a bonsai garden.
"A definite must see when you are in Hue. They are making big efforts to carefully restore the citadel so each year there ks more to see.

Allow a full half day to wonder around and explore. There are plenty of little cages to serve refreshments if the heat gets too much.

It is walkable but from most hotels but in the searing heat its best to get a cycle, taxi or bike (at least one way)."
"We arrived at the Royal imperial city in Hué in a cab from Danang city just after 11am. It took over 2 hrs because we wanted to go over Hải Vân Pass and thought our 9 & 7 year old would enjoy the break. On the way back we went via the tunnel & that shaved about 50mins off but extremely boring. It was a mid 20s day, low humidity & yet felt very hot wondering the large grounds of the palace. For most of the vast grounds there are no covers/shades so an umbrella/hat and sunglasses are essential. Highly stressed that good walking shoes would make the visit more enjoyable. There are kiosks selling cold drinks but no signages for toilets so make sure if you have children or older people with you to case out where they are first. And make sure you have packets of tissues or wet ones available because the toilets unfortunately are not regularly cleaned. The ‘entire’ imperial city is spread out & since we were with young children, we didn’t get to see the tombs, Tiger Colosseum or the museum. My husband & I could happily kept exploring because we found the architecture & history fascinating. But our children were that interested. The only thing they both loved was feeding the huge kois just before you enter the grounds of the royal court."
"This is a fascinating site where the visitor can easily spend 2 hours or more. Enter through the Ngo Mon Gate, facing the flag tower and the river.
The Thai Hoa Palace is superb. Don't miss the audio visual display in the back room which gives a good historical overview of the citadel.
Wander the grounds of the imperial enclosure - restoration has taken place in a number of different areas and there are still large areas of open space. There are many glimpses of how magnificent this enclosure must have been during the reign of the Nguyen emperors.
Wear a hat or carry an umbrella and don't forget some drinking water. There is very little shade through the day.
I have been a regular visitor to Hue over the past 20 years. I still enjoy wandering around the Imperial Enclosure to see the (slow) progress being made with the ongoing restoration and reconstruction."
"As you walk through the Noon Gate entrance to the Imperial Citadel in Hue, one can imagine emperors of Vietnam's dynastic and ruling families holding court to announce the year's calendar and the names of the new doctors of philosophy. Originally built in the 1300s, the Imperial City and Citadel served as the capitol city of Vietnam for 100 years until the capitol was moved to Hanoi in the north by Ho Chi Minh. Within the city walls, two kilometers square and surrounded by water-filled moats, is where the Vietnamese ruling class lived for hundreds of years. Even though much of this UNESCO World Heritage Site was destroyed by wars with the French and later during the Tet Offensive of the Vietnam War, a guided tour is highly recommended to give one the great historical value of this site."
"An experience that celebrates the complex history and culture of Hue and the last ruling dynasty. The space is vast and shows the layout of Imperial city, and life during the the rule of the last kings.The guide was very skilled with excellent English and knowledge of the site. Wear comfortable walking shoes, a hat, take water and allow at least 2-3 hours. It is advisable to go early in the morning during the hot weather."
"Make sure when you visit the Hue Citadel and it’s palaces and pagodas to go and hear a performance of traditional Royal music, singing and dancing in the wonderfully restored theatre. Its very well done and well worth the money."
This was a neat old town to visit. The architecture was amazing for there time. The history in this town was pretty amazing. Definitely something that you should do and see. Would really only go once but should do.
"We only spent a few hours going through, but the historical site, but you could spend a full day! There is a lot to see - very interesting and good for photos!"
"After visiting Khai Dinh’s & Ming Many’s tomb, we found the imperial palace to be quite ‘ordinary’. We paid for an English speaking guide who really did know her stuff.

It’s nice and picturesque but not as lavish as the tombs."
"The buildings and structures are all quite nice. There's a lot of history scripts and informative things to read at the Imperial City, but there's also a lot of open space and fields, and areas that clearly aren't taken care of or have been destroyed over time.

Was nice to walk around for about 45 min, then got pretty boring. 150,000VND entry per person."
We really enjoyed our visit and spent a good few hours exploring the grounds with a local guide. If you struggle to walk there are also golf buggy tours we saw whizzing around
"A small version of the forbidden city in Beijing, China. In fact, the chinese constructor of the citadel did purposely copied a number of elements and even the major layout of the entire complex from China. A number of items are displayed, rich in history and spacious enough for you to get loss and forget the other fellow travelers. Remember to visit the emperor's library and the place where the emperor's mother enjoyed in summer time (it is now converted into a stylish restaurant and you can take a rest there)."
"I was surprised by the size of the Citadel, much bigger than I imagined. Allow yourself several hours to explore the different sections and grounds. We had a private guide and that is very helpful to understand the history and events that took place at the Citadel."
Beautiful buildings and lovely grounds with flowers and lots of fish in the ponds/lakes. Every turning is a wonderful site. Loved it.
We came Hue and it's possible we chosen imperial city for place we visit. Very nice and have many history we need discovery. Too large and it's took about two a half hour for visit.
This is probably the must see in Hue. The entrance fee is still within reason. What made the placw special for me was that it had so many forgotten little corners that one could explore on its own.
"I had the privilege of visiting the Imperial City with a very knowledgeable tour guide, Mr Hoa Van Pham, and found the tour extremely stimulating. If you have an interest in Vietnamese history an you're in Hue, I would suggest you organise a tour.
The amount of destruction that was perpetrated by the Indo China wars has left its mark, however international aid is doing its best to restore the city to its former glory."
The weather there is extremly hot. The place is so amazing to visit. I learnt a lot of Vietnamese history from here.
"There is plenty to see here, and there will be more as restoration work progresses. It isn’t the forbidden city in Beijing but a good pocket version that is manageable in a day (and really cheap, buy the ticket to here and the best three tombs, you have two days to get round them)."
"This historic monument is vast in area but very interesting. It really needs much money to restore to its former glory but once done should rival its Bejing namesake.
Just 200 years old but in poor repair. It is worthy of heritage listing. It needs more explanatory signage & handout brochures and less touts selling their time."
This was great to see and our guid new his stuff we saw a lot of things and were told the history surrounding it. A must see in Hue.
"we wandered around here for hours, very beautiful architecture and truly fascinating incites into Vietnamese history"
"Stayed in the beautiful Rosaleen Boutique hotel right in the middle of the ""NO TRAFFIC"" zone at night and had a beautiful meal and had the cheapest beer in Vietnam at the Ong Tao Res & Bar. O.64 ltr bottle of Tiger beer for 12,000 Dong = A$ 0.69. Went the next day on a beautiful Temple tour, it was more like a mini city with a moat around it. Our tour guy Mr Hao was brilliant. Everyone wanted to take him home. My wife sprained her ankle at the cobble stones and the staff at Rosaleen were very helpful. Our driver came in the late afrernoon and we drove to Hoi An."
We spend almost 3 hours visiting this Imperial City. Take your time to see the inside. Suggest to come and do this first thing in the morning to avoid tourist rush. Amazing place. Inside there is rental clothes and you can take photo and sit down like a king and his concubines.
"We visited Hue so we also went to the Citadel. From the outside it was quite impressive, on the inside it is two nice buildings and many French tour groups. Don't bother making a detour for this"
"If you're a history buff, you need at least half a day to check this place out and soak it all in. Get a prearranged guide instead of the ones on the grounds. Also, ladies are required to cover their knees. When we visited, three of the main buildings were bombed out from the war but there was a lot of restoration work going on. What you see when you visit is mostly reconstructed.

There is also nice cafe at the Queen Mother's quarters to chill at, and we enjoyed feeding the massive kois at the pond there for a mere 5,000VND (cheap thrills!).

Besides that, we came here with the intention of visiting the Imperial City only, and got touted, and sadly, fell for it. We didn't bother reporting to the tourist police because we had various anecdotal evidence (they have no regard for their duties, and will tell you that touts do not happen in Vietnam) that they were collaborating with the touters.

Things to be wary of:

1. If you got there by motorbike, the locals will try and channel you in the direction of the bike parking lot of the Imperial City, where we had our petrol stolen after parking for about two hours.The parking attendant will insist on holding on to your keys and giving you a parking ticket.

2. There are cyclo drivers near the parking lot that say that they will take you to four attractions including the Imperial City for 150,000VND per pax. The rest include the Fine Arts Museum, Old Courthouse and a Chinese Garden. They will insist that their price covers all attraction tickets and after we finished the trip, we found out that it did not include the Imperial City. It was a complete waste of time and money for us because we weren't interested in the other attractions (that didn't even need tickets). If you see them, they will continuously hustle you, and insist that you can't walk around the Imperial City when you actually can. Ignore them."
"Visited as part of our tour so had the benefit of our tour guide explaining everything. The site is vast and takes a while to walk around. It was lost on our children who couldn’t handle the heat and just wanted to get back to the hotel pool! Fascinating for the adults though, and definitely worth a visit."
"I wanted to visit the temple after reading several books on the Vietnam war and the battle here during Tet in 1968.
Entrance is 150000 Dong about a fiver and you can easily spend a day here.
The temple is obviously being slowly renovated but the place is full of original features. Even bullet holes."
"There is so much to see in this huge complex, that I wished I had gotten a guide. You could spend hours there, and I found that things weren't signed very well. I bet I missed out on so many things. I had to Google when ingot back to my hotel to find out more. Get a guide!"
"We booked this excursion within a 13day trip from Hanoi to Saigon and we would like to say thank you to Danny, our guide on this tour to the citadel, boat tour and tombs. His English and knowledge of the history of Hue was excellent, he gave some humorous comments always at the right time. He was always friendly and the tour was very well planned and organized. We highly recommend Danny and the company he works for. He is an excellent guide."
"Awesome to see, lots of history. See the line of kings and their influence on vietnam and how the last king tried to give the country back to the people under democracy."
"Beautiful palace and peaceful place but alot of damage because of the war,only 20 buildings are intact but they are rebuilding it,very nice to walk around the gardens within the walls. Go early or late afternoon to avoid the many tourists,on thursday its open till 10 pm."
"The Imperial Palace is well worth seeing, but tricky to wander around by yourself due to limited information available to make a ""self-guided"" tour informative. It costs a small fee to enter.

The large Palace complex is surrounded by a moat inside the even bigger Citadel fortress, making the place even more impressive. Inside the palace grounds, the main buildings give you an impression of life in Imperial Hue at a very different time. A model of the palace, located just past the throne room depicts the original layout of all the buildings when the palace was functional (no pictures permitted in the throne room and there is a strict dress code to enter-- shoulders and knees must be covered and there is a guard at the door to enforce the rules).

Unfortunately, most of the buildings beyond the first 3 areas were bombed out (they said by the French during the war) and are damaged rubble. We were on a strict timeline so we didn't have time to wander the damaged grounds, but I would have liked to. It might have made the review 5 stars, and having a guide to explain the areas of the palace grounds we toured (the men-only area, the consort area, etc) helped bring the area back to life more vividly.

The palace grounds are one square kilometer in size, not including the moat area and Citadel fortress. The place was relatively quiet and did not feel crowded at all while we were there. Restrooms were available.

A couple of added notes:
- We explored more of the city than Imperial Hue while we were there. We were advised to be careful with our phones, cameras and valuables in public areas. I believe the issue was to not leave them out in the open and not to make them easily accessible to people passing by (ie- for a grab and go) on bikes/mopeds moving along the sidewalks or streets. Keep them secured, don’t leave them sitting around in the open, or walk with them highly visible and easily available. Overall, we felt very safe but were careful about making informed choices about simple things.

- When in public, toilets are not as easy to find and, when available, may not have toilet paper or soap at the sinks, so ladies especially, it is best to always carry your own toilet paper and towelettes. Additionally, most of the toilets are pit-style so be prepared for something different, if you are used to western toilets.

- We found that many vendors in Central and North Vietnam were willing to accept some foreign currencies (this was not the case in South Vietnam where we had to exchange currency at a hotel front desk before heading out to enjoy the towns).

- Finally, I suggest you carry some water with you since there is a lot of walking, uneven ground, steps and open areas. Vendors are available and most shops had refrigerators with drinks so you could purchase some too."
The visit was part of a day trip to various places and time was running out as this was the last stop. I wish I had more time as I found it really interesting and also just nice to walk around as the place is pretty spacious. It’s also more like a Park.
"Amazing place - must do in Hue! No need to pay for expensive trips/guides, easy to walk to and find your way round! Lots of toilets and refreshment places!

We went around 11am and it was quietish! Beautiful grounds! Entrance fee is do small I wondered how they keep up with all the maintenance!"
"This is a very interesting and large place to spend some quality time, there are several layers of history going on here so the stories are quite fascinating. There is a lot of sympathetic restoration going on as well, which will make this an even more impressive view of the past"
"The Citadel is a huge complex , is best to have a guide. Our guide is very good ( world heritage tour) we book tour from Hoi An n the drop us in our hotel in Hue after Tour . The Citadel is beautiful complex full of history n is well preserved, is best to visit in afternoon when is not too hot. We learned so much about the last king"
"We take quality of buildings for granted in Australia, which was only discovered 230 years ago - some of these buildings are steeped in history, have been through wars and are extremely well preserved."
"World Heritage site since 1993.
The Citadel was established by Emperor Gia Long in 1805 when Vietnam was still under Chinese rule.
This fortress is huge, and takes quite a long time to get around, it comprises three enclosures- the civic, imperial and Forbidden Purple Cities.
Despite the horrific damage caused by the many wars,there is a lot of restoration work going on.
Make sure you have good footwear, and plenty to drink, as it can get very hot."
"The citadel is a great journey to Vietnam history with all the historical data that is exhibited around the city. For the start there is a video that tells the story of the Vietnam dynasty and the Hue's history. After that you can get to the grounds and visit temples, small houses, small lakes and praise the handicrafts and carvings on the buildings. Based on your pace and interest the time you spend there can vary from 1 to 3 hours. The entry ticket can be combined with ticket for Khai Ding Tomb and Minh Mang Tomb. Price is really cheap for 3 sightseeing."
Amazing place. We hired a driver to take us around Hue city. The place is full off stories. The builsing was old and full og history. Take your time to read about the Citadel.
"This place is certainly worth a visit, just make sure you allocate a couple of hours so you can enjoy it all. It's an amazing place for people that enjoy both history & architecture. The ground gets a bit slippy in the rain so bear that in mind."
We took a detour to see this whilst travelling through Hue. It was worth a detour but I would not go much out of my way to see it. Its like a mini Forbidden City. Its pretty to walk around but unfortunately we had been to Angkor Wat on the same trip which just makes everything else look less impressive so I am probably being a bit harsh
Interesting to know about thr history of Hue and its citadel. Impressive buildings and now some restaurations of places which where destroyed.
Interesting architecture and amazing discovering the history of the American-Vietnam war resulting is so much of Vietnam's cultural heritage was destroyed. Renovation work of the site continues. It took a while to get around and see it extensively. It's interesting and well worth a visit. You will also see the bullet holes where both sides shot up this old city. There are some lovely buildings and architecture. There is enough room to avoid the huge tour parties!!
Place with a lot history. From the old kings to the second world war and the vietnam war. The reconstruction is beautifull to see. Well done.
A huge monument that is freely accessible to most parts. This really is a look at how the king would live so long ago. The grounds are sprawling but not that well kept. A few sections are being restored and country to requests people still take photos in areas that are restricted. You could spend several hrs looking around. Well worth the effort to get there
"I got their with my wife and the day after, on my own, sketching in a travel sketchbook. I had a blast.. The area is big enough to experience a real cool visit without anyone bothering you.. Just keep in mind: good shoes and the toilets are to search for.."
"The Hue Citadel just goes on and on. Once your enter the main gate you are treated to a wide array of buildings, courtyards and walls. It is amazing to view the history here and how much there is. It is most helpful with a guide because of it's sheer size and scope. Give yourself plenty of time."
I liked most the art and craft workshop in the Imperial City. You will not miss it because the workshop is before the exit to the car park. Recommended.
"The sprawling Citadel and imperial complex was largely trashed during the Vietnam War, but a significant portion has been repaired or escaped the damage. We did a cyclo tour around the place and then walked in and around ourselves. UNESCO - must do in Hue."
I highly recommend it Tour of this site. I had a tour guide named Mr Hoa and he provided an excellent Tour in English. Very interesting history and beautiful structure.
Lots to see and plenty to learn. Walked and enjoyed it all. You should review the history a little before you go.
"This particular location, in addition to a DMZ trip, made the trip of mine extremely worthwhile.
The interior is now being rebuilt. The website itself was the place associated with a fantastic fight in the late 1960s, and lots of of the battle scars nevertheless remain, therefore I had taken many pictures since I picture a decade from today, entire planet would have been completely renovated. There are a few used artillery and tanks parts on screen as a reminder of the battling that took place there.
You are able to arrive there by the less expensive motorcycle taxi, or perhaps by a regular taxi or even operated the tour. I endorse an early and bright call, at 8am, when it opens. You are able to use the cool morning with not many visitors."
"This fortress and palace is really a wonderful place to visit. If you want to do it properly, enjoy the different temple and garden, you need to take at least 3 hours. And be careful, under the sun and the heat it can be a long run, but it is worth it."
"One of must see places in Hue.
But take time.At least half a day,is really big place and lot things to see."
"A must visit when in Hue, the sheer-size is staggering, you could easily spend most of the day just walking around, especially if your into culture, history and architecture. While most was sadly destroyed during two major conflicts, what remains and undergoing restoration is interesting and impressive. When the site was intact and occupied it must have been truly magnificent."
"In spite of massive damage inflicted by American bombs in the 70s and decades of ongoing restoration, there's still plenty to explore and admire. Worth at least a half-day!"
"For your information, so this is Hue Imperial Palace which is the seat of Nguyen Dynasty - the last feudal family to rule Vietnam - from 1802 to 1945. The whole palace is the complex of royal blocks and structures with different walls to protect around. Everything looks really great, specially the main imperial courtyard right in front of Thai Hoa Palace (where the king only met all his mandarins few times a year). The only problems this whole palace has is that it has not been really reconstructed or maintained for years. Many palace buildings look kind of running down, some walls have a lot of mosses, paint look scratched from the wall as if it was not painted very often. Still, I really enjoy being here and immerse myself in a long vanished lifestyle."
The history on show at the citadel is fantastic. The decorations inside and out are amazing and certainly worth a visit. There is lots to see so people should keep exploring beyond the most obvious things. There is lots still to be restored. People should allow a good few hours to see it and be ready for all the other tourists that will be there too.
"Despite much of the site being damaged during the war, there is so much to see here. I highly recommend going with a guide, although there is information provided in English. It is a huge area so we didn’t try and see it all, but the architecture and art brought the modern history of Vietnam to life. Reconstruction continues so not everything is open but there is still plenty to see. Will need to have appropriate (modest) dress for some places."
There is little else to do in Hue so you have to come here. Perhaps we should have got a guide as otherwise you sort of wander aimlessly and there are very few signs etc so you are not sure what you are looking at. It is an impressive site over a vast area but hard to appreciate.
Directly in the center city its the the older imperial palace of the Nguyen dynasties. ITs peaeful compared to Hanoi or Saigon. GO
"Helps to know some history about Hue, I think, as you explore the Citadel. I was there in 68 during the war and recall the damage, which still shows, but is cleaned up. For me, walking around and seeing the history here is very intellectual and fascinating. It prompts an imaginative time (for me) long ago. Absolutely, it is one of the pieces of specialness that makes Hue such a wonderful city. Hue is my favorite city with its history and ambience, as well as normal good places to eat and stay!"
"This is an impressive UNESCO World Heritage Site, and was home of the Nguyen Dynasty, which ruled southern Vietnam 1802-1945. The buildings and their decorative features - particularly all the dragons! - are interesting, and there is a small museum within the grounds."
Part of our city tour of Hue. This is a must see location on a vietnam tour. There are still many shell and bullet holes in the walls of the citadel from the vietnam war where much of the forbidden city was destroyed
"we did a day trip to hue with our private guide. it was a bit far from hoi an itself and our guide added some sightseeing stops along the way.
Hue imperial city boasts rich culture and history if you love such stuff.
Get a guide to explain along the way..quite interesting to see if you have time."
Interesting history to discover in this old city. Some of the buildings are being cleaned and restored and that would make this walled city even more beautiful . Definitely worth a visit
"We spent about 2 hours sightseeing. The grounds are sprawling. Some areas nicely restored, some in need or repair. When sun is up there is really not many places to hide. Worth a visit. Best time to go is on a cloudy day."
"It is recommended to have a guide around the huge campus to really understand or get a feeling about the history.
The monuments are renovated partially and give a good insight into the emperors life.
The walking tour is enjoyable and a lot of shadow is there.
The theater is a gem!"
Informative tour with a guide. Well worth spending a few hours there with a knowledgeable person who can discuss the history in great depth. Loved the history and the beauty albeit in a restorative process as part of the UNESCO world heritage sites.
"An extensive venue which holds invaluable treasures of rich cultural history including the wars.

I strongly recommend all visitors read historical facts before visiting this venue and hire a professional guide to make the most of the visit.

2 suggestions for Deptt. responsible for maintaining this venue as these will add good value for tourists:
1) Consider providing courtesy golf cart or similar transport from entrance vehicle parking to citadel entrance.
2) Show a Audio visual documentary film on site for visitors to get a background of this venue."
They have little busses and Tuk Tuks if you do not want to walk. the grounds go on and on...and it is Hot and humid. But it was interesting and worth the effort.
"You just have to see the old citadel where the last of the Vietnamese emperors ruled from. Make sure to get all around within the walls, as there are many attractions besides the center."
"This citadel is beautiful and is well worth the visit. Fascinating to learn about its history and use.

At this time of year, it was warm, but there were some breezy areas that helped keep us cool. Seats and benches throughout, many shaded by the structure overhead. Toilets available."
"This place is definitely worth the visit. Allow yourself at least 2h. The most beautiful site to see is on the right hand side from the main entrance. Left side is mostly under renovation, but still go to see theatre and bonsai tree garden, very lovely!"
"Part of a Gate 1 excursion, this site is huge…so plan ahead for what you want to see. There are several historic buildings and the site is on a large scale. The perimeter is almost 40 miles long! Stop and see the major historic buildings but, truth be told, they all start to look alike. There is an installation of military history…noticed this on our way out (I would’ve liked to see it). They do provide transportation out to a pick up point so you don’t have to trek all the way out. Recommended."
This is a beautiful place and give yourself a few hours here as it is very interesting. Restoration is ongoing and it is really well done. Lots of interesting information around about previous Emperors
"There is so much to see in this 19th century Imperial City, even though a lot of it was bombed during the 1968 Tet Offensive. Massive restoration work has been done so there is much to see and one just has to imagine the empty spaces like the Forbidden Purple City as it was in all its glory!
We had a guide for an hour and it was well worth it as there are so many different pavilions, palaces & things of interest to see in this vast complex.
We stayed on and wandered down the tree lined paths & big courtyards.
You could go round the grounds on electric cars but this would be an extra charge after the entrance fee."
"The citadel is an amazing piece of Vietnamese history. It’s not for everyone, it’s not Disneyland etc, but if you take time to look, and gather info, you’ll understand why it’s so good to visit. Just find a spot, sit out and chill. It’s 150,000 VND to get in for tourists and come on, they need the funds to rebuild and renovate after the War."
A good place to see some history and get to feel of how the royals lived in those times. Easy to walk around. There aren't many English explanations so having a guide is a very good idea. There are small snacks and shops in the centre of the complex which are way over priced. It gives an interesting insight into aspects of Vietnamese history.
"Yes you can do this on your own but we found a lot of signage was only Vietnamese. Luckily we were part of a day tour, & had everything explained. It is certainly a beautiful place to visit, a real must see in Hue."
"The citadel covers a very large area and involves a lot of walking. We did see buggies transporting people to various parts of the citadel, but we decided to explore by foot this place of great historic interest, with lavishly decorated palaces and places of worship"
This really is a must for anyone visiting Hue for the first time but allow enough time o do it justice. As they continue to restore it I think it will only get better too.
"We were in Hue so of course we had to visit the Imperial City. Well it was the most boring experience of my whole year away. Maybe I was tired and didn’t ‘soak it all in’ or maybe it was just boring - I think it was boring.

We paid 150,000 each to get in. There’s different ticket types so when asking the booking office about which ticket we should get, they reluctantly looked up from their phones and just said ‘150,000’ - so we paid assuming his was the standard ticket. I think it was? But they didn’t speak English.

We walked through into the grounds which seemed pretty cool - massive fish you can feed for 5,000 a bag. (That was the best part)

The rest however is literally just ruins, old buildings etc - yes, we did expect this - but there’s hardly any information around to explain what’s what. History isn’t my favourite topic which may have been half the problem, but there was nothing to engage me in the history for me to even try and enjoy it - I’m sure for some people who know lots about Vietnam already and/or love their history, they’ll find this place mildly interesting - but I’d disagree.

I love photography too but I found it hard to find anything to take a photo of. It’s mainly just flat grassy fields.

You’d be better off looking at pics on Google or going to some other free places around the area which has cool architecture.

For us it was just a waste of time."
"The Imperial city is huge and beautiful, even if a lot was destroyed during the war. Allow yourself 3h to visit it."
"We were just amazed at the sheer size of this place, you definitely need to plan on spending a few hours here. So historic and beautiful. It was so much fun imagining what life must have been like back then. You have to visit this if you stay in Hue. It was brilliant with something to see around each and every corner."
"This was the capital of Vietnam during Imperial Times and, although the city was built inspired by the Forbidden City in Beijing, it has its own character. The only shame is to know that some important buildings were destroyed in the Vietnam war, because you finish the visit with the feeling that it could last much more. And it's just sad to know that a cultural legacy was destroyed by a war."
"it was really beautiful to visit the citadel, but there were really too many chinese tourist groups in the afternoon. at the moment they are renovating a lot parts of the king town, so that was not so good, but the center was really beautiful & easy to go by walking."
"The city was very impressive, but definitely pay extra for a guide, as there’s next to no information otherwise."
"You can't really stay in the Hue area without visiting this site. It dominates one side of the perfume river, and has the biggest flag I've ever seen flying over it.

However, apart from the impressive size of the walls (and aforementioned flag), there isn't a huge amount to see. Many of the buildings which once stood within the walls have been flattened, so there are large areas of nothing inside.

Still if you have a couple of hours to kill, worth ticking a box."
You need plenty of time to cover all of the citadel. It included a very helpful video. Lot's of history here.
"What a fun and magic town
Great bars great foood very friendly place
Party town of south Vietnam
Popular with European people
River cruise and show fantastic
Try the dmz bar
Live music
It’s similar to bourboune st New Orleans
Enjoy
Very cheap place to go like Thailand used to be
50 cent beers $ 1.60 smokes"
"The Citadel was based on the Hidden City in Beijing, however due to war and time there has been a lot of damage. A lot of the buildings are not original having been built over the past years, although they are faithful reproductions it is not the same as seeing the real thing.
Interesting, but not what I expected."
"While the imperial city is a must see in order to temporarily feel like a Chinese emperor, Hue itself is rather passable so I'd recommend staying 2-3 days max"
Came here decades ago and it just gets better over time. Luckily the history was explained better this time and the site was even easier to get around. Construction considering how long ago is amazing and must have been truly magnificent on completion of construction. Sad to see the deterioration over time but overjoyed to see the refurbishment and current use of this site. Sincerely hope the renovation and use continues.
A tour around here will be on any itinerary for this city. The whole area covers a large space but can be reduced to a couple of the more interesting place. Not as grand as other Asian imperial palaces but a good one for Vietnam. Worth having a guide to get the most from a visit.
This place is massive and very impressive. It's the number one thing to see in Hue but it lives up to the hype. The family history and the historical pictures on the walls in one area are very cool. This gives a cool insight to what it would have been like if the royal family were still around.
"The Citadel is a strong reminder of how things used to be in the times of the Emperors.
Imposing outer walls begin to tell the story of a fortified and highly structured royal life.
Each gate has 3 doors with one only for the royal family. There are many gates, each with a story of the role they served.
Originally contains 99 monuments, time and war have reduced this greatly but the majesty remains. An outer walled area begins the journey through a second inner sanctum and finally reveals the royal palace.
Well worth exploring with a guide and you will be rewarded by the sight of an original royal throne. No photos allowed in there though so it’s one to memorise. Beautiful."
"Fabulous example of Vietnamese history but has been allowed to ""run to seed"" a little. Thankfully a major restoration programme is now in hand."
"Entry fee is 150,000 (£4.70, €5.35, $6.60).
We were advised to spend at least 2 hours here but 45 mins - 1 hour is enough!

It’s nice to walk around but not much to see in terms of museum displays, only a few scattered about. Even then, the English ‘translation’ just explains what the letters/art of acts are talking about and not what they actually say."
A good place to see some history and to get a feel of how the royals lived. Easy to walk around. There aren't many English explanations so having a guide is a good idea.
"Lovely to walk round. You can really feel the empirical vibe.
The Opera house performance was amazing. The actors play out original plays the Emperial family would have seen."
"Nice to spend a few hours, kind of expensive for your entrance fee but you can tell they're working hard in the maintaince of the place. Small snack shops in the centre of the complex which are way over priced and staff just grab the money from your hand and walk off."
"History heavy place, most of it destroyed but it doesn't impair the visit seeing how big it was. Very beautiful place"
"The Citadel is very large and gives a very interesting insight into aspects of Vietnamese history. Unfortunately a lot of it was destroyed during the war, but UNESCO has helped a lot with some restoration. Really well worth a visit when you are in Hue."
"I was not expecting this magnitud of city, and well preserved. Vietnam history is really interesting, seeing and listening about it from this city gives a great perspective. Highly recommended to be visited"
Surprisingly a very good site to learn about history of Vietnam of The Imperial City from the 19th century. The display of the 13 kings of Vietnam is good to know. You need a good guide to tell you a story about this place. Weather was good and cooling so it was a pleasant visit.
"Visited here today and loved it, probably my favourite place in Vietnam so far! It's well worth giving yourself at least 1/2 day and take a walk around the whole place, especially the far corners which are quieter as less tours are taken there. The small food/drink place in the Co Ha Gardens makes some great little dishes which you can enjoy while looking out over the bonsai gardens..."
Take your time with this place there is so much to see. Only complaint is that a map would have helped us find the easiest way around especially when trying to find the exit
"We visited this place 2 days ago. It was suprised me because this was my first time to be here. The citatel (imperial) is so big, so great, so amazing.
Got alot of information about this that I d never ever heard before.
150.000vnd /pax/ticket. But I parked my motobike and they charged me 15.000vnd. that was so crazy. By the way I am Vietnamese too even I m looking a little bit mix. This was so insence. I spoke Vietnamese. So u guys next time should ask before park your motobike. :)))"
The site is somewhat reminiscent of China’s Forbidden City but Vietnam’s royal family dates from the 19th and 20th centuries. Some buildings were destroyed during the war but there’s more than enough to see. It’s well worth a stop.
A beautiful example of the architecture and arts of the time. Our guide provided excellent commentary regarding the influence of Feng Shui on the design and construction.
Plan more than a few hours as this site is quite extensive. There’s a couple coffee shops scattered throughout the site so you’ll be able to grab at least a snack. We spent 4 hours plus there so make sure you have comfy shoes as well.
The compound area is huge but mainly ruins. What we saw now all are replica but still worth a visit. It is specifically beautiful at night. Make sure u choose the right time as they will have free loyal dance performance at 10 and at 330pm at royal theatre which is located inside the palace. We spent two three hours inside this forbidden city.
Went there because everyone said it's a must see. Maybe it's best to see it with a tour guide. The place seemed chaotic and not much was explained. Lots of building works going on at the moment.
"Good place to learn about the history of Hue, however you would need a good guide. When we visited, the temperature was cool and that made the whole visit much more pleasant."
"We were told in our hotel that 1.5 hours would be enough time to visit the citadel. However, we spent almost half a day in there, exploring all the different sights."
"We only had 2 hours here. We could have spend about 3 times that! The whole place was amazing! There was a lot of information on signs around the site, but definitely book a tour guide for extra bits of information.

There's so much to see and go round I'd definitely put aside an afternoon especially for this!"
"This is a beautiful complex of buildings and gardens. If you want it all pristine and shiny, you;re going to be disappointed. What I loved was the breathtaking mix of restored buildings and buildings on the verge of collapse, just standing forlornly on the grounds, rotting gently. it's very beautiful in a fallen grandeur sort of way."
"Very good way to spend half a day. Marvellous buildings and very well kept gardens (February visit). Can get very busy, but plenty of room to move around the grounds."
"It’s not too expensive to get in and there are some nice picturesque spots but it’s really not very old and a lot of it is under construction.
There isn’t a great deal to do in Hue so if you are here for a day or two it’s probably worth a visit, but I wouldn’t arrange a trip to Hue just to see this."
"This complex is one of Vietnam’s seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The ‘city’ is actually a palace within the walled Citadel. The complex suffered much damage during the Vietnam war and is slowly being restored. Much still needs to be done.

Well worth a visit in Hue!"
"been here for 1/2 a day its very large area and impressive , restoration work is still being carried out and well worth doing"
Luckily a cool day as there's a lot to walk round - we managed very well without a guide or being driven by electric shuttle bus but the option is there for hiring both a guide and bus if it's hot or you don't like walking. Lots of war damage and renovation but still well worth seeing and lovely peaceful grounds. Outside the citadel we did get a lot of hassle from would be guides and cyclone drivers but you just need to firmly ignore them. The only slightly annoying thing is the lack of maps at the entrance and inside so it's worth trying to print off a map from the internet before you go.
A very special place.The Imperial Citadel and the tour of the Forbidden Purple City was inspirational and exceptional.The tour guide offered real value to this trip with her detailed knowledge.
"Part of Gate 1 tour interesting displays, some structures are original, many are reproductions. Nice gift shop."
Interesting and lovely place to visit and stroll around. Restoration work is well carried out. Gardens are impressive.
"The citadel is large with its three areas, the general open for all, the imperial city and the forbidden city (the emperor plus family and staff only). In spite of the vicious fighting here during the Tet offensive in 1968 there are many buildings still standing and well worth seeing."
Is a very beautiful place. There where many things to see. The gift shops had many things that I had not seen before.
"The palace shows the period lifestyle with many gold ornaments There are many ornaments spread over many rooms.

While it is spectacular, after a few rooms we were bored.

The place is well maintained and little history boards gave brief outlines of the history of each room. Lots of green grass.

The electric vehicle driver was very polite and helpful

There is a good bookshop along with refreshments."
"We stayed at Danang but we make the trip through the Hai Van Pass just to visit the imperial city. much of the city was destroyed in the war and restoration work is being done in phases across the imperial city. Get to see many old artifacts and photos of the emperor, the halls and subjects. Can be really crowded and the place is huge. Only manage to finish half the place in half a day"
"If you stay in Hue this is a nice place to visit.
Big gardens and many buildings, the old citadelle is vey nice"
This place is impressive by its size and is still intact despite attempts by the American army to destroy it during the war. There is a lot of walking to do and a guide is a must to understand the dynasty behind it and the layout of the site.
"Definitely a must see in Hué. Give yourself at least 3 hours. We did it in 2.5 hours, but felt a bit rushed. Note that this is the same as the “Royal Palace” and the “Forbidden City” that are sometimes shown as separate sights on TripAdvisor. Entry fee / cost was VND 280,000 for a combined ticket to the Citadel, as well as Khai Dinh and Mingh Manh Tombs. Take water, hat and sunscreen."
"We went to the citadel expecting to be able to enter the fort, which is prominently situated on the Perfume River. Unfortunately it is not open to visitors.the Palace is impressive but if you have been to Beijing it suffers in comparison to the Forbidden City."
"We visited the citadel in March, on a very sunny day with temperatures around 30 degrees celsius. We arrived early in the morning by bicycle, which you have to leave outside the citadel.
The citadel itself is an extraordinary site with such an astounding history that it really takes time to move around and take it all in. We visited without a guide and read up on the site beforehand, so that we knew about the historical events that took place here and the importance of it for Vietnamese culture. Having a map and an idea of the place really helped us navigate it. It took us about five hours to see most of it, including the “lesser” buildings that tour guides skip.
Apparently, loads of people skip Hue alltogether, leaving two types of visitors for the citadel: tour busses and couples. The tour busses bring guides and selfie-sticks, whereas the couples wander around clutching their maps or guide books. The main buildings are somewhat crowded, but the rest was nice and tranquil.
If you’re interested in Imperial Vietnam, visiting the citadel is a highlight. We really enjoyed it, wandering around discovering the site."
"Visited in March group tour organised by 96 Travel & Tours, Singapore. The place awesome and really worth a visit when you in Hue Vietnam. It's a guided tour. We had a Mandarin speaking VN lady guide, she is very informative and good explaining the importance of how and when about the history of imperial citadel.
The place is so huge and massive and I can't imagine if we need to walk on our own. We are glad that she had arrange buggy ride for us on all the important sites. Pre-booking of buggy rides at VN100,000 2way is worth the price. Estimated about 3hrs in total. No words can describe how wonderful is this place and the history behind it's.

I would like to thanks our Vn guide Miss Tram, Ricky of 96 Travel and teams for arranging such a wonderful trips in Hue Danang."
"Not bad, but must have a good tour guide to explain a history. See all pats, and visit each corner, history is felt from each m of this area."
"It's a nice place to visit. I think it will more beautiful on a sunny day. Unfortunately, I and my friend visited on a rainy day so we couldn't enjoy the scenery much"
Worth a visit to learn about the history of the kings of Vietnam and how they lived. UNESCO is helping to restore buildings which is a good thing because of the importance of the Citadel.
"If you go to Hue... You have to visit this Palace. It is a great testimony of the imperial Vietnamese architecture and life.
To be recommended"
"We knew that the area has been damaged during the wars and decided that we would need a guide to bring it to life. Guides are supposed to provide facts and stories that awakens your imagination and bring things to your attention that you might miss otherwise. A guide should be able to answer questions and engage in a conversation to help you better understand the situation, environment or lifestyle.

This was far from our experience!

Our guides’ English was good enough to tell us facts that she has been provided 3-4 times. There were no stories or thought provoking situations provided. She clearly didn’t understand our questions or comments.

In the 40 minutes she was with us she went to the bathroom twice; took two phone calls; talked with another guide; told us the same things at least 3 times and took us to the area the artists had their paintings. Her attitude was lousy. She was doing the minimal and anxious to get it over with.

I would NOT recommend using one of their guides."
Used Lam from Xuan Tu tours based in Da Nang to visit the old city of Hue in central Vietnam. Lam is very knowledgeable and also very caring in showing his clients around and we have certainly enjoyed his company today. Xuan Tu Tours are a dynamic go ahead company ablely led by a fantastic young lady called Xuan Tu who provides excellent guides and drivers to make each tour enjoyable. Fully recommend them for your tours around Da Nang and surrounding areas.
"We were disappointed that, after paying for a guide, we were told that one had just taken some people out so they would refund our money. No guide. There are quite a few exhibits in English, which helps, but the grounds are very large and not everything is well marked. Some of the sites we stopped at were already closing at about 5:00. On our way out, we saw evening hours but were not told of them when we entered. That aside, the place was pretty interesting. They are doing restoration work and it will be quite spectacular, if not “original”.
Oh, we also took a tuk tuk “tour” around the outside 100,000 dong. It was pretty lame."
"I visited in early March and the weather was still cool in the morning and evening, but warm and sunny during mid-day and noon. This is a unique historical and cultural attraction in Hue, especially after reading up on the heritage of the Nguyen Dynasty.

Entrance ticket costs VND150,000 per person, which is very reasonable considering the fact that it's a UNESCO heritage site. Bring sunblock, a hat and wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot of outdoor walking required from one building to another since the grounds are vast.

A recommended itinerary would be:
1. Ngo Mon Gate
2. Thai Hoa Palace
3. Can Chanh Palace
4. Can Thanh Palace
5. Duyet Thi Royal Theatre
6.The Mieu Temple
7. Nine Dynastic Urns
8. Hien Lam Pavilion"
"It's like whatever didn't realize how little there is to do in hue lol. But worth it if you have nothing planed.

History is also hard to understand without a guid."
"I visited this place at 1.30pm! It was really hot! However the plus points were too good. Much less tourist crowd, the photos turned out so beautifully (the place had do much of blooms) and its cooler once you are indoors. I would say that this is a MUST visit place in Hue. It showcases generations after generations of the Nguyen monarch (there are plenty of their pictures with details), their civil & military mandarins and the architecture is simply mesmerizing. If we just sit quietly in one of their many benches and imagine life within the courtyards of this palace a 100 years ago, its really like going back on a time machine. I did not get a tour guide and I think I did well. Most of the spots had descriptions and there was even a video describing the palace. The Royal Theatre is another beautiful building in the compound which used to function as the entertainment hall for the monarch and their important visitors."
"The citadel itself is a little worse for wear, it was good to see some restoration work being done, the one thing that was annoying were the entrance and exit staff were unhelpful and dismissive. We'd been walking round most of the morning and took a wrong turn out of the exit, after backtracking and trying to.go back in the way we came were were told no, to go back all around to the entrance again. Not the biggest deal in the world but we'd literally taken four steps out of the exit."
Lots of history to see here. Wonderful gardens and lakes. Musical performance at certain times. Easy to get to. Go early before the hordes arrive. Great photo oops. Highly recommended
This UNESCO world heritage site is worth a visit if you are in Hue. It is vast and you would need a guide to get the most out of it. The buildings are in different states of repair / reconstruction following the French and American wars but there are plenty of well restored buildings and gardens to see.
"A great catapult back in time to the Nguyen Dynasty. Stunning architecture, peaceful tranquil and a real must see!"
"In such a historic city, this is a must visit. It's a huge area and there is a lot to learn. We had a guide who was helpful but I do think the right guide will make or break this experience. Our guide was only OK and didn't seem to provide objective facts. There are placards with information but the site could use more for self guided tours. With all of the restoration going on, it will be beautifully restored in the future!"
"The Hue Imperial Citadel is a very large series of ruined buildings, shrines, gardens, and open courtyards. It's a very peaceful place, and there's plenty of interesting artwork to see in the shrines, as well as beautiful ponds and gardens. I had a very good time here.

My only complaint is that it's easy to get lost--there are few, if any, maps, and many of the passages look similar to someone who is not very familiar with the ruins. I'd recommend hiring a guide or going on a group tour to avoid this problem."
It was so big and really great to walk through but I was a bit confused about the exit. I walked back to the front where I came in and was told to walk around to the back.
"Plastic bottles in the water, face masks and Coca Cola cans trash everywhere, many parts have annoying electric cars driving around tourists on tours and don't drive around you just really close and the constant beeping , families with strollers I felt really bad for. Overpriced water bottles etc. The emperors are rolling over in their tombs. Also the tombs are far away so if your to scared to drive or rent a motorbike then high priced taxis and crammed tour buses are your only way to get there. I would only do the tombs and skip the Citadel it made me sad. On the plus side we found Cafe 34 right outside with great food and a view of the moat/river and one of the Citadel gates. Awesome staff and cheap food and beer everyone asks you to join them at the table and have a beer and talk. Hotspots looked and smelled amazing!"
The Citadel must have been an amazing place when it was the Imperial Palace. The remains are very interesting and the pictures from the royal times are so interesting. This place is a must visit if you are in Hue.
"The Citadel is enormous - we spent about 3 hours wandering around the various palaces and buildings. Fascinating, full of history and some beautiful buildings. So much still to do in restoring parts of it but well worth spending some time there"
"The only reason I could think of visiting Hue are this imperial city and the tombs, and sadly I would say that is all.

The city itself was a SUPER touristic place which was always “taxi”, “motorbike” and “do you wanna eat?”. The people really treated you like a “Cash cow” and the air was really bad too.

A lot of place at the palace was closed or under renovation, there was many photos displaying the past views of the palace and some official documents. Yet, there is a lack of explanation which made me a bit difficult to follow. Fortunate that I could read Chinese and I would suggest at least 2-3 hour to learn more about the Vietnam Emperor history."
"I like this place. We went directly at 7:30 am and were almost alone! Very huge, so plenty of space to walk and visit. Take some time. You can visit the Chinese theatre for 200.000 Dong at 10 am or 3 pm inside the palace."
"We had a guide who explained everything and made our visit much more interesting. This is a massive complex, sadly most of it has been rebuilt and there is little original to see, but they have done a good job and it still has a good atmosphere. The walls are very impressive, well worth a visit if you are in Hue."
"We spent half a day here, exploring the entire forbidden city, the palace, the citadel and all the buildings in the compound. So beautiful and so worth it.
Definitely recommended!"
"Hue imperial city is a huge complex located inside the citadel. Though much of the forbidden city inside this complex was destroyed during the Vietnamese war; there is still lot to see and many of the distroyed buildings are being painstakingly restored.

Allow couple of hours to explore this complex and a guided tour will be a great help to know about its history and layout. Without a guide one can get lost as the area is big with some amount of walking to be done."
The palace has many areas to see and shows the opulant nature of the emporers palace. Easy to get around although could be better signposted. There are a number of photo displays to see and a video ahow in the reception palace. There are small buses inside the palace grounds to take you from one location to another.
Visiting the imperial city shows the rich history of vietnam. From the 1st king to the last and the western influence/interference. This is something like the forbidden city of China only on a smaller scale. Too bad many buildings were destroyed due to war. worth the trip
"We spent most of the day at the citadel. Did not book a guide, but just walked around, looked at the buildings/ruins and enjoyed the area. Absolutely worth spending ½-1 day here."
The architecture is amazing and when you realise this was once the capital of Vietnam you are amazed by the wealth and pageantry of the place.
"The immense fortifications convey a message of imperial power. The seclusion of the ""forbidden city"" and its location deep inside the compound reflect the traditional distance between the royal family and its subjects."
"This tourists attraction is maybe the most famous one in Hue city. we are really excited when visited this one and it did not let us down.
All the architecture is really nice. People focused on the very small details which make us feel surprise.
Took a tour guide is really ideal choice."
"No point in coming to Hue if you dont visit the citadel and the old royal palace.

It's a vast site and only about a quarter left standing after the Vietnam war destroyed many of the buildings but it still took us a 2 hour visit to see everything and we raced round as it was getting dark. We arrived here at 4pm and it wasnt too crowded and much cooler so a pleasant visit."
"Well worth the visit to Hue. Amazing restored imperial palace structures. Plan for a few hours to see it all. Wear comfortable shoes, preferably easy to take on and off, since some buildings require you enter without shoes. Please note that the exit is on the side of the complex, and not at the location of the main entrance, we had to walk all the way back to exit the complex."
"Our group of four found ourselves in Hue during the celebration of Lunar New Year 2018--which was also the 50th anniversary of the Tet Offensive. We had stayed about four days n Hoi An before driving to Hue for several more days. All this time, in both cities, we were introduced to contemporary Vietnam and its history under the expert and warm guidance of Ms Tran Thi Diem Linh (arranged through IndochinaOdyssey Tours by our expert planner, Mrs. Mia Wang). ""Linh"" immediately grasped our lively yet lingering pace and our need to ask constant questions (being women in our 70s). If she didn't know, she had looked it up and answered us the next day. She shepherded us through traffic, markets, fabric stores, Vietnam battle sites, ancient constructions, Marble Mountains, pagodas, temples. It was incredible. We were in a constant state of amazement at the depth of her knowledge, her sense of humor which transferred right across cultures, her excellent English, and her fun-loving spirit. She and our driver (who negotiated the dense traffic with skill and a calm manner) kept us well supplied with water and tips on where and what to eat. Hue was a challenge after the more small town feel of Hoi An, and so we welcomed being in Hue with them. I just can't say enough how much history and philosophy Linh was able to get into a walk through the Imperial City. She was our favorite guide for our entire three week journey throughout the country. The richness and artistry of the Imperial City is astonishing. It is hard to imagine what the Vietnamese have overcome and restored in the past 45 years. Everyone was so friendly to us, and Linh was a fine translator. One of us had a birthday during our time with her, and she surprised us with a birthday cake and candles. Really, a visit I will never forget. I also want to recommend their promptness. She and the driver were always on time, and we never waited anywhere. She kept us on schedule, and she had a great sense about when to loosen the reins a bit."
Was the scene of heavy fighting in 1967 and recipient of many US bombs. Well worth half a day as they say.
"This is a famous place in Hue city as well as Vietnam. It is not diffculty to getting to the Imperial City, The price for ticket is so cheap"
"It is very nice architecture building. It is even must better if you hire a tour guide to going with (lucky we did). The lday tour guide told us many stories about the Nguyen dynasty. All are nice and reflect the interesting history of Hue.
Really enjoy,"
"For 150’000 vdn you can walk around for as long as you want in this most magnificent imperial city, easily filling 5hrs of our day today. Plenty of places to sit and rest, this complex is huge and it’s really impressive to see the scale and scope of the restorations that have been done and are in the works. This is a once in lifetime type visit."
Wonderfull place to visit. Steeped in history. East to walkdto from hue centre. Upu will need at least 2 hours to see it all as it is huge!!!
"We made the mistake of walking here in the afternoon and as much of the city is exposed to the sun we were boiling. Maybe go first thing when it’s a bit cooler.

We would also suggest getting a guide as there is a lot to see but without a guide it’s just walls etc.

There is a dress code for the palace, no short skirts, strappy vests or hats. However they did seem relaxed about it. Best to be prepared though incase it was just the guard on that day who was happy to turn a blind eye."
"You better start as early as possible (heat can kill all the desire to explore).
You better take a guide (somebody has to put some stories inside those walls).
You better visit this place while in Hue as it has some kind of nostalgia and magic in the air."
"Tons to see here, you can easily get lost in all the temples. Entry price is a bit steep compared to other attractions in Vietnam, but this is a unique place."
"much bigger then we thought. welled looked after some sections are under reconstruction our guide was very knowledgeable about the history of the place, very interesting could have spent more time there. worth a look"
"In Hue we found two outstanding sites. The Citadel, aka the Forbidden City, was one. Originally built in 1805 as the palace of the Royal Family, much of the Citadel was destroyed during the Vietnam War. Recently there has been considerable reconstruction and more is planned. To fully appreciate this site, visit with a guide who can explain the various buildings and their significance."
"A lot to see here but be careful not to get run over by golf buggies or mopeds who race around the grounds blasting their horn for you to jump out the way or get hit.
A site worth seeing but the experience could be much better."
For anyone interested in culture and history this is well worth a visit. Many many things to look at. I learnt so much from this trip. Read up on it before you go so you enjoy the day more. Far too mny things to write about. Be aware there can be lot's of tourists here and it was boiling hot in February. A lot of the buildings are no longer standing but it still is spectacular.
The imperial city was once the capital of Vietnam and it gives you a great insight into the history of Vietnam and in particular to its former Emperors. There is lots to see so allow at least two hours to get around but to fully understand the history you really need to go round with a guide. Like so many of Vietnam’s monuments in the northern half of the country it did suffer damage during the Vietnam war from bombing raids by the Americans and a large section of the forbidden city right in the centre has been destroyed. Restoration work is slowly being undertaken though.
"The Imperial City in its hey day must have been magnificent but thanks to indiscriminate bombing during the Vietnam War is now a project in progress and being rebuilt. There are many hectares of gardens some beautifully tended some yet to be with pools, temples and palace rooms. It allows an insight into Vietnam’s Imperial past which shouldn’t be missed if visiting Hue. Allow plenty of time to visit, we took 2 hours and could have spent longer there. Well worth the 150,000 dong to get in."
"It is great place to be. The Forbidden City was built in 1802 where the emperors lived until 1945. At this time it was the capital City of Vietnam. Eventhough a lot was destroyed by the indochine war and the Vietnam war in the 70ies, some parts are still original and very beautiful. There are efforts to rebuild the palace and forbidden city as it was before the war. It is a historical and great place to be. Unfortunately we had a very bad official guide. We bought a tour at the ticket desk. So we would recommend to organize a tour guide beforehand. She spoke poorly English and we couldn’t mostly understand her. She also told nearly nothing and wanted to sell us a thumb tour with a guide and Driver for 2 Thumbs for 50 $ (monthly average income in Vietnam is 100$!!). But still it was a nice and historical Place."
The citadel is 4 sq Km in area and started in 1804 and added to over the years. Although many of the buildings are no longer standing there are still many on the site that are worth the visit.
"To see how life was at the time is really nice, we went on a tour so its good to have someone explaining all the details. Its very big and have lots of beautiful things to see."
"Tickets may seem expensive at first, but the sight inside is truly mesmerizing. A real city inside, lots of information to read, beautiful bonsai garden, lakes with hundreds of fish....

The main temples are very crowded but there are a lot of relaxing places where you can wander around all alone.

(Racist fact: separate entrance for vietnamese and tourists, see picture)"
"Built over many years of the nineteenth century, this extensive fortress/palace was apparently modelled on the Forbidden City of Beijing and in that it seemed fairly familiar to us. The symbolism, colour choices of red and gold and the general multi gated courtyard layout is very similar to a scaled down version of parts of the Forbidden City and the Chinese influence is self-evident.

Huge cast Dynastic urns, stone dragons, decorative rooftops, waterspouts and artefacts of all kinds sprawl around the palace, citadel and pavilions. Perhaps surprisingly, photography is allowed ion most locations and we did not find it impossible to get good views and take our time, something of a problem these days in China. A visit to the citadel was well worth the trip - but a guide is essential to gain most benefit for the experience."
"Everybody visiting the middle regions of Vietnam should make the effort to visit the world famous Citadel in the old capital of Hue, and don't skimp on time. You will need plenty of it to fully appreciate the heritage of this fascinating country. Highly recommended."
The palace has stunning grounds and decor. The history was beautifully explained. Take note entry only takes cash no card. A lot of the rooms wont allow photos but its ok because there us the gardens that are stunning and lots of photo opportunity. There is a opportunity to dress up please try my only regret on the day is i didn't dress up.
"During the lunar new year TET celebration, the Citadel was very crowded with many families.
There are many English speaking guides ready to answer “off script” questions."
"It's one of the main attraction not to be missed while in Hue. There is still a lot of beauty to see amongst the remaining structures. It takes a good 2 hours to visit. It's not expensive at 150,000 vd , go early to avoid the heat and the crowd."
"Part of our tour package was a guided tour of the Citadel. Quite an interesting history of this place. Beautiful grounds and gardens.

Perhaps one of the most interesting stops in Hue.
Definitely take the time for this tour. Wear comfortable shoes as the entire tour is a mile or so."
"This is my advice:
1. Do your research in advance and try to learn as much as you can about the site, or else buy/download a guidebook you can use, or else hire a GOOD guide for the site.
2. Set aside enough time to really look around. By ""enough time"", I'd say at LEAST four hours. The site is ENORMOUS, and if you're rushed you probably won't enjoy it much. So don't rush! Relax, enjoy.
3. Make sure that you are dressed properly, as there are some spaces where you have to cover your shoulders and knees -- that's pretty normal for temples and other sacred sites in SE Asia, so it won't come as a huge surprise.
4. There is a cafe on site and it's not hideously overpriced, but it can't hurt to bring some water and stuff because the site is huge and you're going to be doing a lot of walking!
5. Set your expectations. Compared to certain other world heritage sites, this one might pale a little bit. It was heavily damaged during the war (WHY??? WHY are humans so stupid sometimes? it breaks my heart) and may not be quite as heart-striking as, say, Angkor Wat.
Still, definitely go! It's a key place to visit in Hue and deserves your time."
The Imperial City is often included in a package of tours around Hue; far better to go there in your own time and spend 3 or 4 hours wandering around the site. Get away from the crowds in the beautiful Co Ha gardens where the centuries slip away
Loved the self tour instead of with a large group but the signage and lack of good maps hold this attraction back from being five stars. We had a lonely planet book which helped us to map our journey and help us know where to go in the very large complex. We took our time and it was about a three hour stay.
"We came here with a guide, think it would be better to have gone around myself as it seemed rushed and very clinical, do your research before you get and go to the ares that you want to see as there was areas I could have missed but still a beautiful place lots of photo opportunities"
"It's a UNESCO world heritage site so you kind of have to go see it. It was lovely, but very big, I'm sure we missed some of it. There wasn't really one set way of seeing it all so we just wandered through the grounds. Though a word of advise, make sure you cover shoulders and knees or they won't let you in to certain parts of It, I mean I didn't dress appropriately because I didn't know to do so, and may have walked in to the places anyway, no one stopped me but with the signs right outside it I did feel bad."
Provides an interesting perspective on the time of feudal emperor rule in Vietnam. Good to see they are making progress on repairing the site from all the war damage.
"The entrance and first couple buildings are beautiful - setting up high expectations for the rest of the citadel. However, the whole site is falling apart and very unloved. Rubble and rubbish are scattered throughout the site and there is hardly anything to see which matches the first entrance. Signs are few and far between so if you visit without a guide you have no idea of the history behind what you are seeing, or which route to take as you walk around. Very underwhelming, we got through it in an hour and a half... We wonder where the money from the entrance fees are going to, because it certainly isn’t going towards any conservation effort."
"Wide open spaces makes this forbidden city stand out. Undergoing long term restoration which will return it to its former glory, although it appears that there is still plenty of open area. Massive complex which makes for a very pleasant tour"
The imperial city is great to look at. The ancient buildings are well restored and the gardens are very pretty. I do believe someone needs to go through there with a ride on mower more often though. 150000 dong entry and very easy to locate. Don’t forget to feed the fish!
"One gets to see the difference between Hoa Lu, Hanoi, and Hue which have all served as capitals. The Citadel is impressive and rich - the interiors, specially the theater is rich and spectacular."
"Skip the guided tour. Just go around by yourself. The architecture and masonry and artistry and history of this place is incredible. You will get great new photo ops every time you turn a corner. In my opinion, the Imperial City is the one MUST DO when in Hue"
"A signature point of interest aside Eifel-Bridge which is leading also to the domestic market, which you may chose on your way towards the Citadel. Hue Citadel is worth to see, take three hours into account. 150.000 VND entrance fee. Bistro34, a few meters outside Citadel recommended, if you intend to have refreshment after your visit. In September 2017 at high humidity. On this very interesting tour we were guided by Ms. Sammy, BeeBee travel Co.s (our No. One in Hue!) lovely expert."
"I found this site remarkable to visit. A lot has been destroyed by war, but work is being done to try and restore it to its former glory. And what glory that must have been! You can see from what remains in the city that it would have been extravagant in its time. We opted not to do a tour, but just walked around ourselves which was easy enough. Most things are in English so there was no issue in reading up on the history. If you’re in Hue, it’s definitely worth a few hours to visit."
"This was our first point of call once in Hue. It cost 150,000 dong to get in so pretty cheap. There is obviously lots of history here but it’s just not kept very well. I don’t know if the badge of it being a UNESCO site means they can’t do anything but the buildings are getting mouldy. The first place you come to is fine but the others are falling apart.
We spent about 3 hours there (including a cup of tea) and we were done."
Very tranquil are with a lot of history. I have never seen so many beautiful Bonsai plants in my life. I have some nice Bonsai and they are nothing compared to these. Enjoyed my time here.
"The hightlight of Hue. Although it has not been reconstructed 100%, we still see the beauty of the imperial palace. We will come back for sure"
"Well worth seeing .. allow yourself a few hours to. Browse all the various buildings
An excellent way to view is to take a golf buggy (especially if you have mobility problems) they drop you off at key points and allow you to view the buildings at your own pace"
"The whole history behind the Citadel and the reigns of various emperor's is very interesting but we found the Citadel itself to be a let down.

There isn't actually a great deal there (I assume because the Americans flattened it) and what's left seems a bit shabby and not well looked after. It is still an essential visit for anyone going to Hue but we were expecting more.

The lonely planet recommendation of doing it anticlockwise is essential to avoid the extremely load gaggle of Chinese tour groups."
"I spent 1 1/2 days in Hue and took the time to visit this. It was just OK for me. I read some reviews that say you must come to Hue just for this. For me I am not sure I agree. This is not to say this was bad or not interesting. Some interesting documents and photos for sure. Personally I think I was just a bit underwhelmed as I have been to the forbidden city in Beijing and was using that as a reference point.

If you are in Hue for sure worth a visit. To come here specifically for this, I'm not so sure."
What an interesting place to visit. We had a guide with us who was so informative and really filled in the details of this place and what it was used for. Such a shame it was pretty much destroyed during the war. Loved the buildings and gardens.
"Impressive Citadel which was once the forbidden city. Though a few structures are well preserved, a major part of the city is lost to time and destruction in war. A guided tour of the Citadel will be very helpful to understand the details. Also, a video room helps to understand the architecture of the City. A must visit in Hue."
"This is the first time I have had ice cream in such an exclusive place. Just make sure not to have the Korean Ice creams that have been priced double that of Vietnamese ones, which are all priced much higher than market value anyways. You can pretty much sit anywhere within the building and have ice cream. Hilarious! a one time experience.
I wish they had audio guides like in many tourist places around the world.
And actually wish people were not allowed to have ice cream inside the buildings that should be taken care of instead.
Be careful with the taxis that will try to scam you outside - although that has been the case with most taxis in hue in my experience, especially in front of the train station. Out of all the rides, we were able to have one taxi use the meter, which cost us 4 times less the other way (that was negotiated)! I would love to visit Hue again if it were not for those scam taxis. Danang and Hoi An seem to be much more regulated."
"Rewarding to see and learn about ancient Vietnam capital city and palace. Using a guide was very helpful to understand sequence and details of kings/emperors.
This historic site is not fully restored but still well worth seeing."
"We had the privilege of being in Hue for Tet (Lunar New Year). At any time, the Citadel is a fabulous place to visit and spend hours wandering through the extensive gardens, Imperial Palace, various temples and the museums and displays. Give yourself plenty of time so you’re not rushed. At Tet the whole place was decorated in stunning yellow and red plants and flowers... stunning!"
"Very original and beautifu.
You need more than 2 hours if you want to really want to see all the beauty of the palace. We did not get to finish the place in 2 hours because some places we chose to see from a short distance.
Make sure you have a full stomach. No food and drinks in there. No not easy to find the toilet."
"The Palace was built in the early 19th century emulating the forbidden City in Beijing on a smaller scale.
It suffered massive destruction during the Vietnam war and is gradually being restored.
The visit allows for a sense of the scale of the place and a glimpse at some of the interior decorations."
"We visited the Imperial city and it took us a few hours to wander round.
It's a large place but not very much to see. Lots of info but mainly just on documents written by past Emperors. Pictures would be nice if dated and some info on the history would have helped to understand. Lots of rooms with just furniture stacked up.
Enjoyed wandering around the gardens but nothing to get too excited about."
"Really interesting Palace, felt like I was transported back to ancient times and even China!

Make sure you have a pair of good walking shoes as there is a lot of walking involved."
Interesting & informative visit helped by information from our tour guide. Brought home extent of devastation caused by indiscriminate and totally reckless USA bombing during the war. Saw equal devastation at My Son site. Amazing how population has moved on and show little resentment towards Americans in such a relatively short time. We (Brits) still seem obsessed with the 2nd world war!
We biked to the citadel from the hotel which worked well despite crazy no rules Vietnamese driving!!! It is a big place to walk around or get a ticket for a golf cart if walking is a problem. Very interesting stuff about Nyugen dynasty.
"A vast site, but well worth exploring. Also have a look at the 10 minute introductory film, which shows you how the buildings originally looked, it really helped us visualise the buildings former grandeur as we walked around."
A very interesting place to visit. It was busy when we went (Tet festival) but the crowds were soon lost in the vastness of the place. The digital reconstructions shown in the video help to make sense of it all. Thought provoking on several levels.
"Interesting, overwhelming, historical. Make sure you wear good shoes. I was interested in the american war info. The importance of the citadel and seeing it clarified a lot of things for me. Very hot. Wear a hat and bring water"
I really didn't get enough out of this amazing place as I didn't get a guide. I found myself just wandering around looking at it but missed the history of the place and would have appreciated someone explaining what each room or building was for. It is very grand and worth a visit. As you are heading round the bend past the lake on the right there is a lovely garden worth a look and there is a little hut in the middle that sells cold drinks/beer.
"This is a very large site so give yourself plenty of time to visit. My other recommendation is to hire a guide. i cannot help with a recommendation for this as we did not take one, but we wish we had after listening in on some others."
What an enormous place representing such ancient history. How fortunate that it was not destroyed. The palaces and tombs were incredible.
"Do keep at least half a day to explore the vastness of hue citadel. With good weather, this place is breathtakingly beautiful and serene. But do note the ticket fraud which happens at the gates. If you pay in dollars they charge you a ridiculous exchange rate and for any change back they split it between dollars and dong once again to rip you on the exchange rate. This was the only negative of this attraction. Apart from that we had a great time at this attraction. A lot of photo opportunities. We spent around 3 hours meandering through the various ancient buildings. Apart from the ticket malarkey a great day out."
"A vast complex of very well preserved imperial buildings. It's definitely a must see and includes many buildings (some in better shape than the others, there are small cafes and shops inside the complex but expect it to be more expensive than normal prices. I don't recommend this place on a rainy day as the red tiles that many of the paths are paved with are very slippery, it also gets very muddy so it's not the nicest in bad weather. I'd say set aside 2-3 hours for your visit depending on your speed. Some local tour operators include the citadel in their Perfume River cruises but you would have to pay for the entry ticket anyway."
"This is a must when visiting Hue, the last of the Nguyen Emperor's residences, although fairly new 1802 to 1945 the buildings and gardens have been restored to a high standard to reflect the daily life of the royal court."
"Historically interesting and centrally located attraction. Absolutely loved the old Imperial architecture, coupled with the quaint, well laid out landscape of their elaborate gardens. Take your time to explore and walk along the perfume river that’s besides this location. Definitely worth a visit."
Large area for walking. Be prepared to walk. It is best to visit this attraction with a guide. It is enormous. Very interesting
"Give yourself enough time to explore all the different buildings it is a huge complex.
Definitely one of the highlights od Hue"
"Loved our visit here. It's so big that it didn't even feel busy.
Got some great photos and there's lots of nice shops to get snacks and stay out the heat."
The Citadel is a beautiful imperial city from relatively recent history. It’s worth a walk or taxi ride to get there from downtown Hue. It was my favorite thing about the city. Be sure to get a good overview of the area before going in so you know what you are seeing because there aren’t many signs.
"A ‘must visit’ place to any tour of Hue. I would highly recommend that you have a local guide to accompany you to explain the buildings in the Citadel and their function in the Imperial family and their government. Although the citadel was badly damaged in the war a lot of restoration has taken place and this is rightly a UNESCO world heritage site. Part of the entrance fee goes towards further restoration. The sheer scale of the citadel with its moats, fortified walls, and ceremonial buildings gives an idea of the history, culture and power of Vietnam in pre-colonial and French colonial days."
"Overall the only think worth seeing in Hue but Hue is worth the visit if you can fit it in to your schedule ! Massive complex, a lot of it lost during the Tet offensive bombings but cool to see. Read about the history of Hue online as well."
"Stunning architecture, amazing colours and landscape/urban planning. Great to see reinvestment and restoration to old or non existent buildings which were destroyed. Spent hours walking around."
"We visited the Imperial City with a tour guide who gave us an excellent overview of the rich history. While a large complex, some parts are destroyed.
All together a nice and interesting experience but not quite as impressive as other places.
A must while in Hue.."
We visited the Citadel with a guide. He knew so much and it made our visit more worthwhile! An amazing place. Too bad armies felt the need to hide and fight there in the 60‘s and 70‘s. Entrance fee goes towards restoration.
"Probably the number one tourist attraction in Hue. Had looked forward to seeing this World Heritage Site before my visit. Was somewhat disappointed by it as I had very high expectations. Many of the building were destroyed during the war and none of them are over 200 years old. Still the Site is well worth visiting, and the home of the last kings has very beautiful grounds with numerous lakes and waterways. The walls and structures are impressive."
"Historic site. Huge place to venture and many photo opportunities. Had fun feeding the fish for a small token sum of 5,000 VND."
"Despite viewing this spectacular Imperial Palace in the rain, we were captured by the beauty of the architecture, the workmanship and the splendour of the whole area which was very large. We spent three hours here and could have stayed much longer."
"So much has happened here. Very large so be sure to have a guide or guidebook to learn more about concubines, emperors and other interesting stories. Surprisingly run down and also a rainy day- bleak."
"You visit big complex of buildings, protecting imperial houses, walls, rivers and gardens. It is great to see architecture from few hundreds years ago. It is pleasure for eye of person loving old stuff, history, old buildings and lot of walk. More challenging for kids as it could be boring specially for teenagers. You can buy a lot of souvenirs and there are some exhibitions and visualised tv 📺 guides in some of buildings inside. The complex is the centre of Hue"
"Seven of us travelling together visited the monuments of the former imperial City, now a UNESCO world heritage site. We were assisted by a knowledgeable local guide who took us through various monuments and structures within the city.
During the introduction, the guide explained that Hue was the capital of Vietnam, where the emperor reigned through the 19th century and until 1945, when Ho Chi Ming captured power to establish communist rule. The bombings carried out later during the Vietnam War in 1967 caused substantial damage to the monuments within the city.
The first thing you note as you enter are the protective wall and the moat, 11 km long, running round the 520 hectare city. The flag tower flying the Vietnam flag is conspicuous at the Ngo Mon Gate. This huge structure had been the main gate to the citadel with three gates in the middle and two on each side. The middle gate (now closed) was reserved for the Emperor. The two gates on either side of the “Emperor’s Gate” was used by his ministers and other VIPs. The side entrances were for the soldiers and vehicles carrying goods. The hall on top of the structure was the viewing platform for the Emperor in performing his duties such as inspecting military exercises.
When you enter the citadel through Ngo Mon Gate you come to the throne palace, after walking through the bridge built over a large pond. The people who come to pay their respects to the Emperor gathered in the grounds outside the palace. Most important functions such as coronations, receiving VIP visitors were conducted at this nerve centre where the Emperor’s throne sits. No photographs are permitted within this building.
We also visited the Hien Lam Pavilion and the To Mieu Temple which face each other across a courtyard. The Hien Lam Pavilion with three stories is a memorial to the emperors. The handrails at the entrance are beautifully engraved in the shape of a dragon. In front of Hien Lam pavilion are nine urns set up in 1830 to remember the reign of nine emperors. These urns are large and heavy and had been cast in bronze. The To Mieu temple was built to honour the Emperors. The reigning emperor had honoured his predecessors at this building by performing ceremonies on their death anniversaries. No photographs are permitted within the To Mieu temple.
The queen mother’s palace is called Dien Tho Palace and included an audience hall. The building apparently had been damaged during the war in the nineties and had been renovated. . In another building you can see the preserved rickshaw and the palanquin used by the Queen mother. The Royal Library was the Emperor’s reading room. The royal opera house just outside is still functional.
We spent about three hours in the citadel complex walking around enjoying a journey through history imagining what it would have looked and felt like during the time of the Emperors. This explanation is only a little bit of what we saw and experienced!! The few photographs attached will remind me the joy experienced during this visit."
"Worth a visit, steeped in history , bring a camera and comfortable shoes . We visited on a overcast day and was worth it. Hue isn’t big but it’s nice"
"One word (and apologies for the Americanism): Awesome. So much history, a vast labyrinth, and perfectly set. Would love to visit in 10years to see how the UNESCO restoration work is progressing. So beautiful already."
"Went here the first day we were in Hue.
It’s pretty cool, lots of old architecture and also some relics from the American war.

We weren’t so lucky with the weather, I would expect it is better with a lot of sun. Go there when the weather is good, as most of it is outside."
Huge ancient citadel that saw of the fiercest fighting of the Vietnam War just after the Tet Offensive. Bullet holes are all over the walls in various places. They are slowly restoring this huge fortress one brick at a time. Well worth the time to see this historic treasure.
Well worth a few hours here to soak up the atmosphere and get an understanding of the layout. Some beautifully restored interiors (with much more still to do). Such a huge site that you can easily escape the crowds. Seems much older than 1800s construction.
Went there on a recommendation and was disappointed all throughout. Had to tell our taxi driver to get off Facebook on the drive. When we went to the ticket centre we told the lady we wanted a package because we were going to visit a couple of Pagodas the next day. Ya ya she said and proceeded to sell us the day pass only. We booked an English tour guide and paid only to be told the guide was not available. We walked through this supposed sacred grounds that was covered in garbage and had parents letting their kids pee up the walls. If this place was so holy why is it such a dump.
"Visiting the Imperial City is the reason people come to Hue, and it is definitely worth it. From the moat that surrounds the massive citadel, to the various gates and impressive buildings within the sprawling grounds, the imperial city is very impressive. We spent 2-3 hours wandering around and learned a lot about the history of Vietnam. Highly recommended!"
"This is well worth a visit. It's a large area and there is plenty to see. Although there was some destruction in the war of independence against the French and again in the Tet Offensive during the American occupation, plenty of buildings survived and others are being rebuilt"
history has it. at least the govt now spent some.money to maintain it. some parts are already in ruin. note follow the people you can get through the same entrance as exit.
"I guess this is the highlight of everyone’s stay in Hue! It is a very different piece of architecture but I didn’t like the new constructions that were done in the ancient premises like tennis court, cafe etc.
Do take a guided tour if you are short on time!"
"We hired an on-site guide for an hour at 150,000vnd. The guide was very useful in helping us understand the site. Well worth the money. It was our first time hiring a guide. I wish we had done it before. The site is very impressive and large but I preferred the tombs more. If you leave by the East gate cross the canal and turn right you will get to the Museum of Antiquities. You can get in free on your ticket."
"What an amazing place this is, and how sad so much of it was destroyed by bad actors on both sides during the Viet Nam War. This is definitely a must-see if you're in Hue or anywhere close. We came from Hoi An (three hours away by car) to see it and wish we could have stayed longer. There are so many little nooks and crannies to investigate. It would be helpful if you brought some kind of map, though, as the signage isn't good, and it's easy to get lost. Be sure to cover yourself well - no shorts, no t-shirts, etc., and wear comfortable shoes - you'll be doing a lot of walking! Also, if someone is picking you up after you visit, you might want to make sure they know where the exit is. It's not the same as the entrance gate. Again, get a map!
I'll review specific buildings and attractions here (e.g., Halls of the Mandarins, Royal Theater, etc.) in other entries."
"Wander at you leisure around the Imperial City, a World Heritage Site, or better still take a guided tour as the explanations of everything will be more expansive. Highly recommended."
"fair bit of walking, probably best with a guide, not a lot of signage, Interesting history and quite picturesque."
I was blown away during a three hour wander around the fascinating Imperial Enclosure. It's great to see such amazing restoration and preservation. A remarkable site.
"The Imperial City is a walled, Royal palace within the citadel of the city of Huế, the former imperial capital of Vietnam. There is a vast, 19th-century Citadel surrounded by a moat and thick stone walls. It encompasses the Imperial City, with palaces and shrines. The Forbidden Purple City was once the emperor’s home.

Within the Imperial City is the Purple Forbidden City, a term similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing. It is called the Forbidden City because access to the innermost enclosure was restricted to the imperial family."
"Very impressive historical architecture for royal families. Personally having interest in defensible structure, the three walls were magnificent. Over view showed thoughtful urban planning on a grand scale, probably without local permits. Subtle signs of East meeting West with structural designs."
We needed to get from Hoian to Phong Nha Ke and used the transfer services of VM Travel in Hue. Not only did Alex drive us safely in a clean car but he stopped off at places of interest along the way. It was trouble for him to detour out of the way to the Vinh Moc Tunnels. I thoroughly recommend this service.
We went on a tour. If I could do it again I'd go by myself and take my time to see this beautiful place as you could easily spend at least 2 hours looking around. Very beautiful.
"Lots to see,different styles of buildings depending on historicsl dates.
Wonderful colonial photographs.Opportunity to dressand be photographed as Emperor or Empress"
"If you've been to the Forbidden City in Beijing and are expecting something as spectacular you may be disappointed. In its day this must have a truly magnificent place but the ravages of war, lack of restoration, and a steady onslaught of tourists have taken their toll. It is now a ruin badly in need of expensive restoration. Nonetheless the scale of the place is impressive and its place as a well-defended sanctuary, surrounded by walls and a moat, is obvious."
"If you are at all interested in the history of Vietnam (if not, why are you going?) the Imperial City is a must. Because the area is so vast it never seems crowded. But look out for all of the tuk-tuk type vehicles running around with tourists who don't want to walk. To fully enjoy the experience we suggest a tour guide, either private or small group, or do some reading and bring a good map in advance.

There is a lot of walking and sometimes not much shade, so bring water and something for shade. There was a lot of fighting in the Citadel during the '68 Tet
offensive. The damage is clearly visible.

We were on a private tour with an expert guide, which made all the difference. He brought the Imperial City alive for us. We highly recommend at least a half-day, and if you can, use a guide."
The Imperial City is very much worth a visit. But make sure you spend the extra money and get a guide. They'll explain the history of the city and is importance. Otherwise there really aren't any markers or anything in the city that explains the history or what the buildings are. When you get to the ticket station it's easy to ask other groups if they'd like to join you on the guided tour and you can all split the cost as well making it cheaper.
We only came to Hue to visit the citadel and the tombs of the kings. It’s worth coming here just for this. The grounds are so big so it doesn’t feel like that there are many tourists around. Give yourself a few hours of you want to cover everything.
"A very rainy couple of hours was spent in the citadel in Hue. There is enough to see for a few hours if you aren’t getting soaked to the underwear! But if you are genuinely interested in the history, then go with a guide or read up beforehand as there is little in the way of information on site."
This immense property was very interesting- we went in the late afternoon and it was so pleasant. We hired a guide and that made it much more enjoyable than if we wandered around ourselves.
What a beautiful place to visit to feel the past. There are not many sites left in the world to experience this. The buildings are crumbling and the colors are fading from the walls. They stand majestic. If only they could talk and tell their stories. The grounds are well maintained. Well worth a visit.
So interesting. We had a guide with us which helped us to understand what we were seeing. A few tourists there but not overwhelming.
"Of you are a lover of history and culture, this will be a good place you have to visit in Hue city.
It kept the historic valuable items about Nguyen Dynasty. To understand more, you can go with your guide and spend about 2hrs here.
You need to buy tickets in entrance gate, 150.000 / person.
Especially, there is a place where you can borrow the King's clothes and take photos, I didn't remember exactly, but now it's about 50.000 / person, so it's nice.
I would suggest to see it."
We visited with a small tour group of 12 and are going back today to look around. There are beautiful potted flowers everywhere at the Hue historic sites. Our guide told us that this is what is done to prepare for the Tet holiday. One thousand years of Chinese influence is obvious in the design of the buildings and layout of the complex. Seeing the throne used by all of the Vietnamese emperors made the day.
"We enjoyed our visit to Hue although it did rain most of the day which spoiled it a bit.
The city was damaged a lot during the war and so they are still doing major renovations on the main structures.
The building are interesting and have a lot of history well worth a visit on a day spent in Hue"
"Brilliant! Best experience in Vietnam after Halong Bay cruise. Not to be missed. I recommend you book a local tour guide as I did through my hotel once I got a feel for the place and the place got a feel for me. Long, my guide, was amazing and also gave me some very useful tips on other aspects of my tour."
"There is much to see at the Citadel so ensure you have sufficient time (3 hours), I would advise getting a guide for the tour as there is little in terms of information boards and its vast nature could see you wandering aimlessly. The temples and buildings inside are spectacular. They are strict on dress code- covered knees and shoulders; in addition, you do have to take your shoes off on at least two occasions. The citadel is steeped in history which spans a number of centuries. It is a must see."
If you are in HUE then you will go here. Hard to miss. Well worth the time and admission to go. Not necessary to have a guide. It's very interesting once you are in behind the massive walls. I would suggest two hours is plenty of time to see it.
"This is a good place to visit but the less information visualize there so it's difficult to get to real details.
Be aware when you buy tickets as I herd some bad stories
It's a huge area, at least you need to allocate minimum 3hours for this.
Get ready walk a lot."
"Spent a good half day walking around the citadel on a terrible rainy day! If I’m honest I was expecting more , parts are in need of major renovation but it’s still worth viewing if you are in Hue."
".....this place is about as close as you're ever going to get to the set of ""Hero"" (2002 Jet Li film about an attempt to assassinate the king). Couldn't stop thinking about it as we walked round.

The City is vast and these days the main gate is surmounted by an enormous red-with-gold-star Vietnamese flag. I found it easy to become disoriented and was glad of our guide Vinh who navigated the place perfectly and explained much of the history."
"This is a must visit attraction when coming to Vietnam in order to know more about the country's history. The city is quite large and I was surprised that I got lost a few times. I admit that I was a little ignorant prior to arriving at the Imperial City, not knowing that large portions of it were destroyed during the Vietnam War. Those expecting a city of the magnitude of the one in Beijing might be a little disappointed for this reason. Our tour guide gave us free reign to walk around the city ourselves with no explanation, and I would definitely suggest having a guide for explanation and interpretation."
What an impressive place. Something new to see around every corner. This place is huge. Not really as old as it looks but stunning. Well maintained.
"When purchasing our ticket we bought a 3 entry ticket for 280,000vnd each but didn't understand that the other 2 tombs, Minh Mang and the Khai Dinh tombs are 10 and 8 kilometres from the Citadel itself. It cost us 400,000 vnd return to Hue in a taxi! If you only want to see the Citadel just buy the basic ticket. Our fault as we should have put in some research."
"This is a fairly large palace compound and an excellent place to learn recent Vietnam history. Lot's of interesting information.

The last emperor of Vietnam is the same as the last emperor of China - becoming a puppet of colonial power."
"We have travelled many palaces in Asia, and This palace is particularly unique because they have managed to keep it about 80% authentic structures. It is beautiful and it’s worth it to hire a guide at the front because each area has a different meaning and purpose. The guide service is 150,000 vd for about 45min-1 hr. Make sure to wear respectful clothing. The entrance fee is 150,000 vd/ person (foreigners)."
"Very good especially with the photos telling a much more detailed story.
Recommended for all
Remember to buy the ticket for the Antiquities Museum at the same time because that Museum does not have ticket sellers"
"Our travel agency, Tonkin recommended it and boy were they right! It's like waking back in time and seeing a magnificent palace with an incredible history. We even took our photos dressed like kings which was totally fun. Don't miss it!"
"Most of the imperial city in Hue was destroyed but after intensive restoration work we can understand what was originally there. The Imperial city is very impressive and in order to visit all important sites, a visitor will need several hours."
"Beautiful restoration going on, very peaceful and tranquil setting, you shouldn't come to Hue without visiting here"
"The grounds of it are protected by fortified ramparts 2 kilometres by 2 kilometres and ringed by a moat. The water in the moat is routed from Perfume River through a series of sluice gates. This is a great sprawling complex of temples, pavilions, moats, walls, gates, shops, museums, and galleries, featuring art and costumes from various periods of Vietnamese history. The citadel was badly knocked about during fighting between the French and the Viet Minh in the year 1947, and again in the year 1968 during the TET Offensive, when it was shelled by the Viet Cong and then bombed by the Americans. As a result, some areas are now only empty fields, bits of walls, and an explanatory plaque. Other buildings are intact, though, and a few are in sparkling condition."
"If you’re in Hue, this is a must see. Give yourselves a good few hours as it’s a big site and there’s loads to see. I particularly enjoyed the garden with all the bonsai trees. Very peaceful"
"I would consider a must visit place. Just a quick short 10min drive through the city and you are there. It is much same thing when you are in there, but it's the viaicalmsize of the place when you start to walk around and all the history to take in makes it a well worth stop.
Dress code is required. Pants below the knee and shoulders must be covered on both males and females.."
"Totally with the 150,000 VND to get in. Beautiful old city full of long corridors and green space. A photographers' paradise!"
"The price seemed expensive in comparison to what we heard from tourists would only cost $2. However, after paying a lot more than this we spent at least four hours wandering the ancient grounds. Don’t go when it is raining as it is mostly an external site to inspect! Great history here, take lots of water."
"The citadel has lots of history but it left us wanting more. I would hit other sites over this one. If it’s a nice day, you can get nice pictures"
"I have visited there more than 3 times, the first time when I have graduated high school and went there with my Dad. The 2nd time was the University graduation intern. And then lastly when I had a business trip there with Hue City Tour Full day, combine to visit 3 Tombs and The Citadel as well as Thien Mu Pagoda. Each time to visit there to bring me the different feelings, more understandable, more proud of Vietnam. Even most of the palace was destroyed during Vietnam War but I could imagine how the beautiful which they are during the monarchy. I would love to be there again, not only for business but also for my personal trip."
"The imperial city cost 150,000 dong to get in per person. As one of the most expensive tourist attractions I’ve been to in Vietnam (I’ve been here three weeks) I expected this to take the cake. However, the imperial city leaves much to be desired. It’s lack luster and in pretty bad condition. Nothing is well marked nor are there any prompts as to what you’re looking at. Not worth the price. On a beautiful day could be a nice place for a stroll but an expensive one at that."
"This is unquestionably the number 1 attraction in Hue.
Even if far too many buildings have disappeared (victims of war), the ones remaining give us a good idea of the past magnificence of this Imperial City.
The place is quite extended so make sure you dedicate enough time to wander around the park and enjoy the whole of it.
Do not hesitate to escape the crowd and lose yourself in some unexplored corners, with original buildings..."
"Easy to navigate around.
Great to see what is left after most of it was destroyed in the American war.
Nice history and plenty of signs are in English.

You can easily spend a day here looking in all of the buildings and annexes."
"At first glance the site seems small, but make sure you go through every door and pathway. It is actually huge and well worth it. We spent three hours wandering around. There are also hidden coffee shops."
"The citadel is very reminiscent of the Forbidden City in Beijing, but smaller. Some of the buildings are under renovation so were not open. However, we got a got idea of the life style of the royal family. A must visit in a Hue."
"Interesting to learn about the different dynasties, see how people lived, and learn about the different impacts of the various kings."
Really big and beautifull! Too much to see! The price is worth it. You need a phew hours to see everything.
"This is the old royal capital. It is quite huge and needs lots of time to explore. There are electric carts to rent to take you around if you can't walk a lot. This is somewhat limited in time so you don't see everything, but it is well worth the $12 for the entire group if you are limited in movement."
"Absolutely huge place. Very impressive. Most buildings are very well kept, with a programme of restoration that appears to be on-going. We consider ourselves 'average tourists', but even so were glad to have had a second day to take everything in.

Only regret is that we paid for an electric vehicle to take us around - agreed on a time (45 minutes, or whatever) and the lady driver tried to get rid of us LONG before our time slot was up, which was regrettable.

It might also be worth knowing that we saw various kinds of rodents (believed to be rats), both in and near several toilet blocks and very close to a coffee shop. Having said that, we did NOT feel that hygiene was in any way compromised - I only mention this here, because I saw one or two people who were taken by surprise and appeared shocked...."
"A beautiful remainder of the days. In process of a controversial restoration as elements are not true to the original buildings; however,it depends on ones perspective.

The architecture is wonderful and the buildings about the site are worth a visit.

Be careful when walking about, of the minibuses that speed between the compounds. Nice gardens too"
My wife and I took a cyclo tour which gave us the opportunity to cover a lot of ground that we would not have been able to do and much less seen. One inclusion was the house of Uncle Ho's mothers house.
"This is a large site. We got a bit of an introduction from our guide, then given 20 minutes to ourselves. This was nearly long enough! We dashed around as much as we could, but the buildings are interesting and extensive, and you need time to wander around.
There is a dress code to enter the main building.
We did Hue on a day trip from our cruise ship berthed in Da Nang, so this was about a 2.5 hour drive to Hue, and then back again. It was worth the long drive. We would have liked more time at the Citadel and some of the Royal Tombs."
We came here on tour and glad we did that with tour guide. So much history about this site and about Vietnam too. Only sad thing is this was ruined a lot during War time. Would be very nice after restoration.
It is a huge area and we walked for half the day around many old buildings. It was stunning and still very much being excavated as we found pieces of pottery all over the grounds. You feel as though you have walked in right after they have evacuated. Beautiful citadel.
"We took most of a day walking slowly around the entire complex. Take a guide-book: a guided tour isn't necessary and then you can take your time. Although there are many tourists it doesn't feel crowded and it is all flat and walkable although 'golf cart' electric transportstion within is available. Buy the combo ticket is you also intend to visit the Tombs outside Hue - cheaper. There is a small cafe serving ice-cream and drinks but we didn't discover any other food sources. A fascinating place and worth allowing 3-4 hrs, maybe more."
"An amazing insight into what life was like, you truly feel like you are in another place. The architecture was interesting, the signage was informative & lovely colourful gates were scattered throughout. Definitely feed the fish - they are huge and love to be fed!! Unfortunately there was quite a lot of construction, otherwise I would have rated a 5."
Most of the building are destroyed after war. It is huge and you need to walk a lot to explore. I asked for a local tour guide there but she I didn't much information from her. The tour guide did not explain well like what I have experienced before and need to see the notes most of time.
"It was chilly. A sensation I’m unaccustomed to in Southeast Asia. The rain kept The hoards Away. There will be hoards. We got some very beautiful times in solitude, the ghosts of splendor whispering over our shoulders. The vast courtyards, the fading Gold, the charming mosaics and the endless colonnades with illuminating exhibits... we felt the echoes of a noble empire destroyed by egalitarianism drunk on power.

My recommendation: Go, with an umbrella and a good camera. It worked for me. Haunting and impressive. A delicious combination..."
Try feeding the fish - they will go crazy (the fish food costs 5000VND)! Dress code required to visit the temples: cover your shoulders and knees!
"We arrived early via cab and purchased a four Temple/Tomb pass which was good value and kept us committed throughout the day with seeing all four sites. Would recommend a guide if you're keen to delve into the history and maximise the visit.

Easy to walk around the different parts of the city and appreciate both the architecture and history of the Imperial City. We had a rainy day and found easy still to move around without too many problems.

A couple of tips:-

*If damp, worth having solid shoes as many parts of the city have very slippery tiles and easy to loose your footing.

*Respect the city and remove your hat when entering religious sites (it's signposted) but incredible how many tourists failed to show this courtesy.

*When coming out of the city, there are huge banks of taxis and touts shouting for your business. To avoid being ripped off, select your cab by confirming a meter arrangement and well presented car/driver. We found a lovely quiet gentleman (Linh) who ended up driving up for the rest of the afternoon."
"A good and interesting day trip to the Imperial City. Never know that Hue has an imperial city until my visit to Central Vietnam in December last year. An interesting site to learn and see the history of the Nguyen dynasty.
However, there are some renovations going on and one may not be able to see the whole city in one day."
"This is the main attraction in Hue. There is very little signage so if you are planning on visiting and don't like the idea of a guide then go prepared. I found a self guided tour of the citadel on line. It recommended 8 things to see and gave a little bit of info about each one. We followed this and it made the trip more enjoyable. Without it, I think we would have missed areas. It is a big place!"
"Good tourist place to go, there are a lot of tour groups in many different languages. Might be worth while joining one."
This place is very large and is a full day of walking and seeing the whole place. The place was badly damaged in the American war and is been re-build over time but well worth a visit
Impressive and beautiful! Well kept. I was pleasantly surprise to see how reasonable the prices in the curioshops were.
Allow plenty of time to visit this massive series of buildings and ornamental gardens. This was the third stop during an intensive day's sight-seeing around Hue and was by far the most impressive. My favourite part of the palace was the series of quiet gardens with rows of ponds and potted bonzai trees. These were lovely places to take a breath and reflect. The Imperial Palace is a must-see in Hue
Huge place and in various stages of deterioration and restoration. Actually quite good Seeing them carrying out the work while you are there. 150000 vnd on entry and it's quite a big place.
Otherwise just walk around and around and take pictures. There is some information on cards scattered about. Interesting info about various Vietnamese rulers. Lovely buildings in need of further restoration.
"You can feel the rich history of this area. We had a guide so we didn’t peruse the displays very much, but didn’t particularly notice many either. Not as grand as it once was, but you can get the feel for its importance."
"We were dropped off by our driver from the hotel at the main entrance, purchased our tickets and started exploring.

Wandering through the grounds and the buildings, allowed us to take in the history and culture of the time.

If you are being collected after the visit, ensure you coordinate with the person(s) on an exact meeting point, as the place is vast. Maybe exchange phone numbers to be safe!"
Hue is full of history and the Citadel is just one land mark. You really need a lot of time to see and fully understand the history of Nguyen dynasty. A guide or guide book is a must.
"The imperial city is certainly a must see in Hue and we enjoed our visit which covered about 1/2 day. Unfortunatey the attraction is somewhat marred by the unruly hordes of tourists who are bused in, race throught the compiund snapping photos, then leave without really knowing what they are seeing. Nevettheless it is certainly worth a visit."
"Halong Bay Tour agent booked us a full day tour that included a tour of the Citadel. Despite about half being in ruins and undergoing restoration, this is a fascinating and impressive historical site.. gardens within forbidden city...beautiful. The woodwork, pigments, unicorns, dragons, tigers... despite it pouring the day we visited this was wonderful.
Tip, wear shoes with grip if visiting in the wet. Choose your tour carefully as the one we were booked on rushed us through. Which was a pity. So if you can maybe book private driver so you can enjoy this at your leisure..."
"We decided to book a tour guide when buying our tickets, it wasn’t expensive. We had an excellent English speaking guide who was informative and helpful when answering any questions we had. She helped us understand Vietnam’s complex history. The citadel is peaceful and still shows pieces of a lost time in history. It’s really worth while visiting."
"We visited the Citadel on a very rainy day but it was still very beautiful and definitely worth the visit. If you follow the sites counter clockwise you end up at the front gate, from which you can not actually exit. Sort of weird planning but I gather they want you to visit the gift shop after. Beware of the li e up of taxi drivers wauting outside ready to overcharge you for a ride. Negotiate the price!"
"We did a Citadel Tour with Mr.Dee from Deluxe Group Tour in Hue and it was fantastic, really worthwhile getting a tour to learn more rather than just wandering around without a narration."
"A surprisingly large and reasonably intact citadel.

Dress to cover shoulders & knees as there are some places inside where western summer dress isn’t acceptable, although they appear pretty relaxed about this despite the clothing regulation signs.

Worth watching the short video near the entrance to help you understand the history.

Some excellent restoration work being undertaken.

Probably worth getting a guide to understand more although we didn’t bother & still enjoyed it."
"If you are in Hue, you have to see this place. This place is big and it’s beautiful. The entry fee is 150.000 vnd."
"If you want to learn about Vietnam history for the last thousand years, you need to visit this site. It is massive and was even larger in that time period. You do need to have a knowledgeable guide. Otherwise, you will miss a significant part of the meaning of various areas in the site."
"We visited on a very wet day and still had a lovely time. There's loads to see but you could cover the grounds in 1.5 hours ish if you're only passing through hue.

Definitely worth either finding an online guide or using the lonely Planet book to help you navigate the citadel as the signage is sparse and it seems super easy to wander off the path and find yourself lost! Really really sadly the citadel was extensively damaged in the wars and therefore there is ongoing works all over the site. Whilst this is fantastic that it's being repaired, it can make walking around even more confusing and tricky! Be patient and wear good shoes. Sometimes the paths disappear as your walking on them.

Overall, an absolute must whilst in hue! The gardens inside are so so beautiful and a peaceful escape."
The area of the Citadel is huge. One could walk for hours. Vietnam is undergoing a spate of renovation of many of its monuments and religious spaces. It is doing am excellent job.
"Loved our stay in Hue, especially the Imperial City. Allow 3 hours to visit this impressive site which is well worth your time. It is beautiful and there is much history."
"Closes at 5pm, costs 100,000VND. Beautiful place with some interesting history. We rented a motorbike to get here, but it is accessible by taxi or by foot. Must see in Hue."
"I really enjoyed our visit to The Citadel and we spent much longer there than I expected. All I can say is the place must have been very beautiful before it was attacked during Vietnam's various Colonial Wars. It remains a must see experience and I'm sure it will be even more interesting once more restoration has been undertaken. It was also great to walk around a site that didn't have motor scooter access, it was one of the few places I went in Vietnam that was truly safe to wander around."
This is a must see. The imperial palace is beautiful and this is its Majestic entrance to it. Surviverd 1968 and 1972 onslaught. Gives a good impression of what was inside and still is.
Very pretty and well taken. You see people working and everything is very clean. Ticket is 150000vnd.
"Tour needed to understand the efforts for restoration after war damage in some areas, beautiful situation, history, tranquility, just amazing"
"Duong, our tour guide for Buffalo Tours made our visit a wonder. The history and facts she knew of the area were remarkable. When we asked to visit Marble Mountain, she immediately made a call to the Buffalo Tours headquarters and between the two, our wishes and itinerary changes were seamlessly taken care of. They made this portion of our tour of Vietnam a charm. Sincerely"
We have been there and were a little disappointed.. we are since 4 months in south east asia and we saw a lot of pagodas or kings paalaces or oldtown cities and and and.. but this was not the highlight. Not even in the middle.. the entrance fee around 100’000 dong is also too much for what you get. But in hue a must do... yeah instead of that i would prefer other things in hue.. but go there and have a look..
Was an interesting place. Big history and good to know. I highly recommend it. Just don’t forget your drink bottle and you have to wear some covering your knees and shoulders also wear shoes that are easy to take off.
"I’ve travelled all over the world and seen hundreds of palaces, temples, pagodas etc.
The history of the Imperial and Forbidden City is impressive. Repeat “The history”!
In reality little of it survived the wars.
What remains is sadly run down, in very poor condition, poorly restored, and poorly presented by an uncaring, uninterested staff.
You have to go because it’s in the center of the town.
It’s a pleasant hours stroll unless your in the hot season!
Just don’t expect too much!
The most fun was feeding the koi carp!"
We have visited many pagodas and historical places in Vietnam but this was one of our favourites. Great place to wander around and read about the history and view artefacts. Plan for at least an hour as there is lots to see and it's a big place.
"Many people skip Hue when visiting Vietnam. What a shame! Its sites are amazing.

The citadel and imperial city are beautiful and what has been restored gorgeous. We spent about 4 hours and could have stayed longer were it not for tiredness and hunger!!

We were lucky to visit in the low season - so no throngs of visitors. But, it was still busy. My suggestion for high season would be to go very early or st the end of the day."
This place is very large. Interesting to see how the emperor lived. We had a guide so we had lots of interesting information that I wouldn't have known otherwise. We were there during the rain. Many of these buildings sustained major damage during the war.
"Deserves a visit, however it is not spectacular as described. We have been in many places in Asia, and definitely this place is not comparable at all at Ankor in Camodia or the Royal Palace in Bangkok. There are just a few buildings in the Citadel that are still intact, they date back to the beginning of 1800."
So much of ancient Vietnam was destroyed in the various wars but it was great to see so much of an ancient site still in tact
Well worth getting an experienced tour guide for this sight. We had Ruby show us around and she was excellent. So much information. Highly recommend.
"We did a tour of Hue and I was impressed with the Imperial City because of the history. Was just nice to be guided around with an english speaking tour guide to explain the ""this is and that is"" parts of the citadel."
"The citadel is a very large area, we spent 2hrs there but could have spent more time. It's interesting to see how the emperor's lived. Many of the buildings were destroyed during the war but they are slowly rebuilding. We had a guide which I would recommend as we received a lot of information."
"Be prepared for little information so a guide could be good!

Take your time wondering around as there is lots of ground to cover and lovely from all angles"
"We enjoyed our visit here, it's quite big but was really good to walk around and see all the different buildings. We were a little disappointed with the overall state of the place as the floors were exceptionally slippery and could do with wash to prevent accidents. The exterior artwork didn't appear to have been looked after either there was very weathered to say the least.
There are some really pretty gardens to look at and walk around and some interesting architecture."
This place would have been great in sunshine but we happened to be there at the tail end of the cyclone that just missed the Mekong Delta hence the rain! It was interesting and well worth a visit
"The citadel houses the majority of Hue’s top attractions and is a must to stroll around and see.

Allow a couple of hours and remember to dress appropriately!

A lovely way to spend some of your day in Hue"
A must see steeped in history I could of easily spent a day here unfortunately our visit was a little tight in time
"Built in the 17th century by the first Emperor of Vietnam. He was the first to unify the provincial areas under 1 government.
Hue was chosen as the capital because of its central location in this long narrow country."
"The Imperial City is amazingly beautifull, especially the Royal Theater. Nowadays there are a large restauration work on progress but eventhough, still plenty of wonderfull spot to see"
The Palace's design was modelled on China's Forbidden City in Beijing when Vietnam used to be closely related to China. The style of The Palace in both layout and appearance does show a degree of similarity to The Chinese Imperial Palace. But the details and quality of buildings are not even one tenth as good. The most disappointing thing is that the whole place is in a state of disrepair.
"Cannot compare with many monuments in other parts of Asia,but neverthless provides a glimpse into a shortlived but important dynasty and time in Vietnam. Remember that it was almost completely destroyed in the Vietnam war(the viet minh sheltered there and made a last stand after the tet offensive). So it is not as genuine as we would like."
Historical place. We spent almost 4 hours here. This place was quite impressive and helped me know more about Vietnamese history. The museum and the mausoleums was impressive...
"Fascinating place from the story of its building through to the partial destruction by humidity, flooding and conflicts. Restoration is ongoing but I hope they know when to stop as completely rebuilding a destroyed building is replacement. A must see location"
"This is a huge complex, with lots of walking (although some of the tour groups were using electric carts) in the hot sun. However, the buildings are beautiful, and the historic background is interesting – be sure to come with a guide! It’s hard to see everything in this expansive walled city, but for us, the highlights were the royal theater and the library, both fully restored."
"Although much of the Imperial City was destroyed in the French and American Wars, enough remains or is being restored/rebuilt to make this a very interesting place to visit."
"The Hue Imperial City gives a smaller scale taste of the famous Forbidden City of Beijing. Set over a wide area many building decorated in ornate patterns, giving insight into the life of the Emperors and Mandarins who ruled Vietnam over past centuries. The strong Chinese influence is visible as visitors wander the extensive grounds containing temples, palaces, family residences and manicured parks and gardens. The complex is surrounded by a series of high walls which are interspersed with elaborate gates. Visitors are free to wander and should allow at least half a day to cover the grounds. Signage is in Vietnamese, French and English. Snacks and toilet facilities are available; plenty of taxis are waiting to carry weary feet home after a busy day."
"The imperial cite is a must !
The place is very big , allow yourself some time to visit this amazing site
But most of the buildings need some restoration and refurbishment
But still a place to see in Vietnam"
"My wife and I visited this when I was recovering from
The flu and it was raining constantly in spite of the above this is an extraordinary site in an exquisite city"
"This is a good place to visit when in Huế to learn about Vietnam history during the Imperial Period. This was our second visit since 2004, and we decided to go without a tour guide. The exhibits have improved, including a video to quickly ramp up on the history. It seems that more buildings have been restored and open to the public compared to our last visit 13 years ago. I hope that the people of Vietnam will continue to restore the buildings and add more exhibits."
We spent around two hours here and still didn’t really give it the time it deserves. Worth a visit if you are interested in history or architecture.
"It was dark when we arrived at the Citadel so we are only able to see the exterior. Our guide mentioned Hue, the city where it is located, is home of the Forbidden Purple. He told us the place was bombed in the Tet Offensive of the Vietnam War and is slowly being restored to his original beauty. The Citadel is surrounded by walls and has 10 entrances. It its heyday it was the place where Emperors lived and conducted business of the city. There is a large parade area in front of the citadel. I did some research when I returned home and learned there were once 160 buildings within the walls but less than 12 survived the Tet Offensive"
"What an amazing place! We had a rickshaw ride around the old town first, which was great. The architecture is stunning."
"We entered the Palace at 15:00. It was very hot at first and we hid in the pavilions watching a movie about the Palace and reading information about Nguyen dynasty emperors. But at around 15:30 the air got cooler and the place got very peaceful, quiet and beautifully lit by the evening sun. There were hardly any visitors left and we really enjoyed walking around. I especially liked Dien Tho and Truong San residences in the northwestern part of the palace. We left after 5 p.m. and wished we had more time to leisurely walk around."
"If you're in Hue, you just can't miss this. It's a beautiful glimpse into what the ancient (and not so ancient!) Vietnam Imperial Court used to be, and a great piece of architecture. Unfortunately it has been heavily bombed and many of the buildings are not there anymore. I really hope the government will rebuild them somehow, to show what the full complex would have looked like."
"The Imperial city is worth a visit if you are in Hue just be aware that its not well kept. Except for the first hall, most of it is sadly destroyed but if you walk around you can find some nice little side temples and halls (with very little visitors) that give an idea about how grand it once was. I recommend hiring a guide or atleast pre-read about the Nguyen dynasty so you know a bit more what it is about."
Very interesting and must place to visit.very large. Wish there was a good map which we didn't find to navigate. Lot of history. Wear good comfortable shoes because you will walk a lot
The Citadel was huge with lots of interesting spots and things to explore. Thoroughly enjoyed the visit there. Highly recommend it.
"It is a very interesting place with loads of information about the history. It's lovely to walk around and very nice for photos. There isn't many options to hide from the sun though, so be prepared for quit an exhausting experience as it takes a long time to see it all."
"Interesting for a few hours! Take a guide book to learn more about where things used to be, but could be cheaper."
The king‘s town is a beautiful and lovely reconstructed. You could have a Walk through The several buildings. There are also Gift Shops and Hand craft shops ( painter). As always there are a Lot of tourists and if you are Interesses in architecture I would recommend to doc a Guide tour
Huge area with high diversity. I was impressed and found loads of photography moments. You can go almost everywhere. Direction signs for toilets and exit are very poor. Some options require additional fee and there are some souvenir shops in various buildings. Not a good choise for me. Value for money for me knowing it supports continuity and rebuild
"If you are around Hue it worth a visit to this place to see the beautiful buildings in Chinese style. Unfortunately most of the complex was destroyed during the war, however you can still make an idea of its magnificent."
We visited this site with a tour guide and unfortunately didn’t have enough time there. I would recommend visiting with guide and then going back again for a casual stroll through as there is much more to see.
"Must visit as part of a city tour of Hue. Steeped in history.
Recommend that you use a guide to explain the significance of the different parts of the palace.
Many opportunities for memorable photos."
"This is an amazing place to visit. I wished I had a tour guide to explain everything to me but I got bits and pieces from my cousin. The entrance fee is 150000VND which is quite steep but it was beautiful.

There's ruins that's being restored and if you enter the places where the king sits on the throne or where the King's mother sleeps, ensure you're not wearing shorts or a singlet since there's a dress code in there. The rest of the site doesn't have a dress code though.

Make sure you leave a couple of hours to explore because it is very big and I was in awe. Definitely recommend this attraction for those who love history and is interested where the king lived."
"The palace in Hue is lovely. There's the throne room which is impressive, and also gardens and other areas at the back which are very picturesque. Very tragic that so much of it was destroyed during the war, but some of the restoration has been really good."
"As the old seat of Imperial power in Vietnam, no trip to Hue is complete without spending and hour or two wandering around the open grounds of the citadel. beautiful architecture, and great contrast between restored and unrestored areas."
"I had never heard of this palace. The place is very large, with a lots of buildings.
It is worth visiting. The place will need a lot of work to show the previous splendor. There is restoration in progress, but the place is so big, it will take a long time and a lot of money to be restored."
"Excellent experience, one of the must to see in hue city, well maintained structures occupying a very big area"
"Well worth a visit if staying in Hue! Impressive and relaxing to walk around. Would highly recommend, even in the rain!"
Unbelievable place. Read up before you go and worth getting a guide and possibly an electric cart.Very large with a lot to take in. Warm with clouds and light rain the day we went......breathtaking.
We enjoyed our tour here. I think it helped to have a guide with us to explain the historical significance of the things we were seeing. We were here for a little over an hour. If you visit on a rainy day wear sturdy shoes as many of the stones/ tiles you walk on are quite slippery when wet.
"This is a pleasant historic site to spend a couple of hours walking around. The outer citadel walls, the size and moat is very impressive but the inner buildings are a little lack lustre. Worth a visit but there are more impressive historical sites elsewhere."
A visit to Hue must include the visit to Imperial city - at least 2 to 3 hours - or more as feasible.
"This is certainly a beautiful location and, if you know what you’re looking at, very interesting. The combo tickets are useful for also visiting the other main tombs (2 day limit on ticket including, day of purchase) we had to wait 20 minutes for tour guide, it didn’t bother us but two other families gave up and sort a refund. The guide spoke good English, very friendly but a bit rushed (tours only an hour) and I guess the rush back for more waiting folks.

The only thing I would say about guides was there wasn’t too much extra she told that we couldn’t have worked out for ourselves. The building are beautiful but very stained from the harsh Vietnamese climate (very wet and then very hot) we went on partially raining day which was fine... sadly probably 90% of buildings have been destroyed by French and later, America incursions.

They have fixed some smaller pavilions up but it’s going to be years before they eventually get any semblance of its former glory. That said there’s still plenty to see the grounds are beautiful but must take a lot of maintenance to keep up. Seeing the video with its digital recreation was very good (and sad for what’s gone) you do see bullet holes from the Wars. It would be great if they had printed MAPS with descriptions of where to go first, audio tours would also be useful.

The Purple Forbidden City is part of the site (and entry) theses really hardly anything left here but the renovated library (see pic of old and new tiles) with its porcelain inlays on the outside where stunning. The gold fish pond near here was also beautiful.

Easily 2 to 3 hours of wondering around,there is an electric bus for payment, for elderly and the footsore.

The Hue Museum of Royal fine Arts is a block from the exit of the Citadel, and had some stunning displayed china, jewellery, woodblocks, fashion and artefacts worth seeing. Separate ticket price"
"The Citadel is the main attraction in Hue - even though it isn't that old, it's architectural and cultural heritage is important. The photos in the citadel are interesting and the red and gold makes for great photographs. Beware of the tiles when it's raining."
"We enjoyed our visit to the Citadel and didn't go with a tour or guide. On the day we went it was raining very heavily and had been for some days so parts of the grounds were flooded. Strangely this was a great experience, the rain stopped shortly after we arrived and it was very pretty with the water around. The grounds are expansive so plan at least 2 hours to look around. The rain also deterred the tourists so we had the place pretty much to ourselves. I agree with other reviewers that there is no real information about the place. We got a reasonable history of the various buildings from the Lonely Planet guide book but more at the Citadel would be an improvement. Otherwise it was a really enjoyable and interesting walk around. I have included some photos of the part flooding, but recognize it would be impossible to plan a visit with the same conditions. I think my enjoyment of the place would have been less on another occasion with lots of people around."
This is probably one of the things people come to Hue to see - that goes without saying. A fantastic citadel and temple complex - can easily spend hours walking around to see everything. It’s great to see that they are restoring a lot of the structures. It’s about 6 USD entry. It may not be that interesting for those who aren’t into historic sites. Kids seemed to be having fun just being around the site. Take an umbrella if chance of rain as there isn’t much shelter from site to site.
The citadel and forbidden city exceeded our expectations. There are now many restored buildings. It is a beautiful and special place. Bring snacks of eat before or after.
"You surely have to visit the Imperial Palace once you are in Hue, however don't expect much. The place is quite big but really under-maintained and, in some places, literally falling into pieces which is a shame.

If you plan to spend more time in Hue and visit some of the tombs as well, consider buying a ticket combo which you can use to visit the Imperial Palace as well as 2 or 3 tombs - just FYI, the tombs are located a bit further from the city centre."
I know it's only 7 bucks but it's a pretty muusa bles place in the ra in... under construction nothing much to see.
The imperial city is huge & Hue is doing a good job in their restoration work. I would suggest complimentary guide services by audio so visitors can have a better understanding of Nguyen dynasty history & architecture.
A must see. Even with youngish kids there's enough for all ages to get a real feel for the history of the imperial times and the lifestyle of the emporium. Our day was raining and there was a power cut at the citidel but this did not affect our enjoyment. Its a fabulous destination which would be perfect on a full day of sunshine. You could wander around idylically for hours.
"The Imperial Palace is nice to visit, to see and understand the great history of Hué. But it's not blowing you mind away."
"Visited here with teenagers - got there by Cyclo. Lots to see, really interesting and extensive grounds. If you want you can dress up in old traditional dress and have photos taken. Enjoyed by whole family."
Although we went on a rainy day this was a most impressive place covering some large area - there were many interesting pictures and the buildings were lovely giving some sense of how it must have been - the entrance and reception buildings were quite impressive if you could imagine all the ceremony that went with it all.
"Of the original 160 buildings only 10 important ones remain after the 1968 Tet Offensive. But it is worth visiting. Very impressive entering gate. Around the compound, 2 by 2 km: fortified ramparts and a moat. Efforts are made to restore some buildings (they are doing a great job here). Others: only the foundations remain. Impressive throne hall, pavillions, garden of the imperial mother... plenty to see and admire."
Our day-tour was organised through our accommodation; The Orchid Hotel (wonderful!) and this was the first stop. I wasn't sure what to expect at the Citadel. It's huge and imposing from the outside and really impressive on the inside. Lots of different interesting areas. I particularly liked the gardens and ponds near the back - beautiful and tranquil. Well worth a visit if you have a couple of hours to wander around.
"It's beautiful but not it's not well maintained... the French signs doesn't always means something and you easily get lost and find it uninteresting if you doesn't have a guide book or a tour guide. There clearly need some lights when it closes, we had to walk very carefully because it was all wet and it slides. But it is very typical, and part of the history of Vietnam and Huê, it is the most important thing to see in the citadel"
"This was a fascinating place - having read much on the Vietnam War, it was very fulfilling to experience some connection to Tet, as well as the much deeper history of this ancient capital. Highly recommended."
It’s worth seeing I enjoyed what it had to offer. The architecture of course is beautiful and if you have a guide you’ll learn the history behind what you are looking at. If you don’t care about that then just take pretty pictures and read the small post they offer which is not much. If it’s warm weather they have a dress code so dress modestly. I recommend seeing this site.
The size of the Citadel is amazing and the remaining buildings and grounds are be refurbished which will take many years. Many are open to the public. Understanding the history and events is important to get the best out of your visit.
The huge palace tells a hundred years story of 13 kings and breathtaking story of Vietnam. We had a guide who introduced the story with all its highlights. Never miss it!
This is the best choice when you visit Hue city and know about the history of Nguyen Dynasty in Hue city.
"Not up to what one might have hoped - no glittering jewels, so sumptuous lifestyles of the rich and famous. Besides gilded throne hall, the place is red wood ad nauseum.
Well worth a visit for half a day or, at a run, two hours. It is large and spread out. I am grateful there was a brief English translation of pictures and documents on the walls. This made it more interesting to stroll and view what was once a noble empire.
As usual, one gets the feeling that the west was to blame for its rather bare look. Bombed by the French then the Americans (why bomb a palace I don't know), this is ignoring the looting that might have occurred.
Take 2-4 hours to stroll around. It was pouring with rain when we went but many of the paths between buildings are covered."
Well worth 2-3 hours to wander around and go back in time. Wish i had a few more hours here though! Particularly loved the long corridors and the exhibits.
"The Citadel is a huge complex that includes Hue's Forbidden City. While many structures are in ruins, some such as the throne room have been nicely restored. It could take you several hours to see all of it. We had 1 1/2 hours on our tour and I feel like we barely scratched the surface of everything there."
"Very nice and really huge. If you come to Hue is obligatory.
The price is fair. 150k dongs for adults. So like 6 euros"
"Very likely the one too thing to see in Hue. It’s easily accessed and is currently (ongoing) in renovation. The city has suffered through weather and wars and requires a substantial effort to be kept intact.

Entry price is affordable, and you can get guided tours as well. Some areas are not for photo taking, as it’s considered a holy place."
Amazing but a guide is necessary. So much history to absorb and considering I don’t like history I was fascinated .
"Although much of the buildings have been destroyed, as compared to Forbidden City, this place has its own charming character.. much small in scale, but decked out in its distinctive Hue yellow tones.

Much more work needs to be done to make this place majestic, but you do get a sense of the Nguyen emperors’ opulent lifestyle."
"We visited the imperial City as part of a guided tour of Hue highlights. For me this was the most impressive part of the day as the citadel has so much history and relaxing gardens.

Our day started with a boat trip down the Perfume river and after just over an hour we jumping off the boat at about 10:30 at the citadel and it was not remotely crowded so had a leisurely walk around. Our guide talked us through the history as we wandered through the ancient building.

Well a visit."
Very impressive. Best with a guide both for the ancient and modern history. Best bit of Hue. Good to bring water.
"Paid the 150,000₫ entrance fee. Dec.2017. The city is worth a visit. As you enter the one and only entrance, you are greeted by the view of the main palace, which had tarps draping down from it, not a great photo. Your not allowed to take photos inside the main buildings. The city is kind of split into three sections, the left, centre and right. To the right is mainly construction work, except for the garden towards the back of the right section. The centre section has some Koi Carp, then the palace, followed by some ruins and a few souvenir shops. To the left is some temples and some residences. My personal favourite was the Truong Sanh Residence, right at the back of the left section. It was very beautiful with little bridges, a moat and some nice buildings. You can also take photos inside of the golden thrown and chariot. In the main palace you can pay extra, I think is was about 180,000₫ and get dressed in period costumes and have your photo taken on a thrown in one of the side buildings. I spent about 3 hours wandering around."
We entered with expectations of a little more information but felt disappointed with the lack of information and all became bored very quickly. Perhaps an English speaking tour guide would be good here but for the already pricy entry for a family of 5 this could blow your costs. If history and architecture interests you then go for it but it was t for us. The fish feeding was our greatest highlight!?!
"If you love history this will be the perfect place for you.
There’s a lot of walking involved and climbing steps.
The unbelievable fact is that the building was destroyed by the typhoon but rebuilt again.
Would definitely recommend this place to a friend"
"Very good experience for young children who like history.
Lots of walking involved,but worth it.
Very educational and interesting about the Vietnam war."
"This place is a must see for every culture/history lover. Severely damaged during the 'American' war and the red revolution (which not many locals dare to admit), it still offers really nice insight to the life of Nguyen dynasty. It is definitely worth getting a guide (for 150k; speaks decent English)."
"I have watched so many shows about Chinese feudal dynasties and its architecture. Then when i was here i felt like i got lost in a Chinese citadel. Well yeah more than 1000 years being under domination of Chinese affected Vietnam architecture so that's why. But trust me you still feel something really Vietnamese here. Awww i love it. So fabulous <3 I love Hue, i love Vietnam, my amazing country"
It was my second visit to Hue and I loved it just as much as the first time. I don't think Hue gets as much hype as it should. The colors and buildings just pop out at you. Its a must go while in Vietnam!
Huge grounds that should be covered with assistance from a knowledgeable tour guide. Bring along water and umbrella so that you are not affected by the sun/rain or tiredness and can enjoy the visit.
"During the war, this area was heavily bombed so they are restoring some of the buildings. We were on a Hue City Day Tour with Hue Vacations and this was one of our stops. Our guide purchased a ticket that included entrance to the Citadel, Khai Dinh Tomb and Minh Mang tomb for 280,000 dong.

The complex is quite large, however, you can't enter any of the buildings so walking around will take about an hour to 1.5 hours."
This citadel is massive take your time to walk and visit all the main gates and gardens-a lot of destruction still not repaired from the Vietnam War when the Americans bombed the citadel as it was infiltrated with the NVA.
poor reno job patrolling by unfriendly guard . see it once and never come back again ..Must of the repair job was tacky and touristy
"we spent about 5 hours walking around, could have spent longer if it wasn't for the rain showers. beautiful & fascinating old buildings"
"The Ngo Mon gate is only for entrance. The tourists should be noticed about this when start visiting the Imperial City, so that we should easy find the way out after finishing our tours in it. Have a good time and enjoy it."
"This is a must see in Hue.
We spent almost 3 hours here.

Look out for the maps displays on site.
You can easily miss some of the temples and Buildings. (Well I did..but I found them eventually when I saw the map.might be just me..)

Well worth it."
"Although this is undoubtedly an impressive site, we visited when it was raining and we were very limited on what we could do. I would say this is ideal if it's a clear day or at least not raining as you can enjoy the surrounding grounds and really take in the architecture."
Not far from the town and very big area. It will be advantage if the information and sign inside the area had provided for visiter
"Coming to Hue, I had limited expectations of the Citadel based on the photos I saw on the internet. However the photos really don't do the place justice.

The Imperial City is absolutely gorgeous and I just wished the weather had been better. Otherwise it would have been perfect."
"This was amzing site to walk around. Although it was ruined alot during the war, but this will be amazing after being restored. We were lucky ti have local tour guide to learn a lot of things here."
"The place is much bigger than I though, almost like a labyrinth. You think you've finished seeing it all and then surprise, there is whole other section to cover! It is an interesting place full of history worth spending a couple of hours exploring. I only spent one day and one night in Hue so my only regret is that I didn't plan a longer visit (2-3 days) as it's definitely worth it!"
"We had a lovely time strolling around the grounds in the evening when we arrived in Hue. Beautiful citadel filled with history and amazing architecture, a must see in Hue!"
"Super large city, so much to explore that the tours do not go to. Spent a few hours hear reading history and looking at the ruins and buildings I would wear clothes that cover shoulders and knee."
This place was quite impressive. Coming here helped me know more about Vietnamese history. Walking around this place was interesting.
"The Imperial citadel is more a ruin at the moment. Much of the buildings has been destroyed and there are quite of lot of restoration going on. There are many photos/posters to depict the various emperor's rule and characteristics. It is a good place to learn about the history of Vietnam, though u will probably enjoy it more when the restoration is complete."
"We travelled to Hue on a day trip from Hoi An. There were great sights along the way particularly the views from Hai van pass....stunning.
On reaching Hue we were dropped off outside the Imperial City - we were advised not to take a trip with the guys outside...as they stay outside the City grounds itself...so only a lot of wall to be seen!
Inside the place is great to wander around and wonder at what life for the Kings, their wife's and families must have been like. Certainly well worth the trip to see."
"The imperial city is impressive from the start as you glide by the walled buildings of past emperors to the entrance.
Inside is a rich history about the way of life inside the citadel.
Expect to be there for an hour or two as you make your way around the grounds. Well worth a visit when in Hue."
"Worth a look-see. The site is quite expansive and very impressive even though much of it seems to be in disrepair. Worth touring around especially if you have a guide to explain the buildings, gateways, and history."
Thoroughly enjoyed our day here. We walked through the middle section and then hired an electric cart to see the outside areas.
It was a nice experience at least for me since I'm a huge history nerd. Might not be impressive after similar attractions in Asia but gives nice view to local culture.
"A wonderful place where to spend couples of hours. I suggest you to make a ride with a rickshaw around the city wall, and than make a tour inside the old citadel. You need a guide to being fully into this experience"
"This is one of the most important historic sites of ‘old’ Vietnam. Make sure you allow plenty of time to explore the various buildings and exhibits. Some people have commented on the state of repair - but there is just enough degradation to give you a true feeling of the age of the site, and all the important parts have been looked after and/or restored for visitors."
"The temples are boring and nothing special compared to others we have seen on our trip, like the King‘s palace in Bangkok. Avoid Hue, there are better places in Vietnam."
The Citadel gives a very good overview of an important part of Vietnam history. The museum and the mausoleums are impressive
"This palace/ city/ citadel gives a good view in the history of Vietnam, the way the royalties and people lives in those years."
"There's not a lot of shade here, so I would recommend visiting this either as early in the day as you can, or late in the day. If you go earlier, it will probably help you navigate around the tours pretty well, although a lot of them just kind of go around on the little tram so you kinda just have them around you for five minutes and they're gone again. It's a very nice place to walk around for a few hours and get some good pictures. The layout and stuff reminded me frequently of the Forbidden City in Beijing, though not quite the same scale/grandeur. It's definitely one of the main things to see in Hue, so if you're already there I would recommend visiting it. We didn't do a guided tour, we just walked around for a few hours and read the plaques/our guidebook for info."
"Wonderful to see, whether you just want to wander and admire or to read all about the history, with a wonderful display of photograghs from it Imperial past up to the renovations that are currently taking place , well worth a visit"
"Obviously amazing in its day and desperately sad that it was runined by the war.
The photos were interesting
The people on duty were unhelpful and you cant leave by the door in which you enterered and have to walk about a mile round to come back to the same place and there was hardly anyone there and so no need for crowd control. Really unhelpful."
"The citadel is HUGE.
I spent about 90 minutes here to just admire the expanse of the place.
There’s so much history behind how VietNam was formed and this is definitely *the* place to be at if you want to know more since Hue was the capital of Vietnam before HCMC became the capital.

I paid 150,000 VND for an entrance ticket and it was definitely worth it."
"We spent a few hours here and did not see it all, don’t rush it, take your time and read the plaques and take in the architecture"
"We visited the imperial city on a Princess Cruises tour and what a morning we had the site was magnificent. A spiritual and cultural experience not to be missed. Buildings steeped in history, our tour guide was fabulous and really helped to bring the place to life."
"Huge squares, beautiful buildings. You should read the review tables and have the opportunity to take a few hours to walk around."
"A really amazing citadel. It's a far bigger palace than any in south asia. I hope the govt spends more on the maintenance and introduce stuff like light and sound shows to make the experience better.
The city of Hue is lesser known than cities in Thailand and Myanmar but has richer history. A lot of the citadel was destroyed in war which is under restoration.
This is a must visit in Vietnam!!!"
"The area is 500 hectares! The grandeur and elaborateness of the decors of the temples is a must see. Some visitors don't show respect by wearing shirts and sleeveless tops. I'm surprised that being a communist country, the guards were not as strict."
"It was some nice buildings and good information where a lot were written in English. Unfortunately it looked like the area was not that well preserved. The grass was long, it was mud and car tracks on the lawn and a lot of buildings looked like they could need some restoration."
"Entry fee is high. Many tourists of course. But you can also be alone in some places. Nice to walk around and see the old buildings.
Unfortunately the exit is far away from the entrance as we had to walk even more."
"Visiting Imperial city you will travel back to past centuries during Empire and colonies and feel the scars of the last war, Hue having been border of South and North.
Buildings and gardens are fairly well preserved.
You might appreciate interiors as well.
Consider 2 Hours for the tour.
Guide is mandatory."
"Given that it is the most important attraction in Hue, we were expecting more. Ticket is 150 000 dong per person, but the place is not well kept, with construction and degradation everywhere. Lots of potential but needs much more maintenance."
Absolutely breath taking! The guide wasn't brilliant but worth paying for. Very peaceful and beautiful.
"This is an impressive site even with the level of ruination. There is a lot of renovation/restoration work in progress, for better or worse I'm not too sure! I would strongly advise that you take a guided tour to get the most out of a visit. As well as getting all the pertinent information, it could take a huge chunk of your day just wandering about on your own."
Plenty to see lot's of art work and information to read about. Unfortunately we came here when it was raining so the humidity and the dampness prevented us from exploring more of the area. Definitely would come back if we have more time and if the weather permits.
"Toured throughout the entire complex took about 1.5hrs, interesting info on the emperor's of vietnam and the damages from the vietnam war. Was raining but there are covered areas to walkthru and stay dry. There are even free electric cars to get you from one end to the other. The entire citadel is quite huge. Really enjoyed the visit. A must see when in Hue. Also enjoyed walking outside along the most area and park for some great picture spots"
"Loved this one, despite not being museum person. Great insight into feudal and Pre communist vietnam"
"This is a large site, entered via a gate, over a moat and it feels like a citadel. Several buildings to visit (although only 20 of the original 148 are left) so you get the full impression of what must once have been a great city in its own right. Several temples & pavilions still extant, with beautiful carvings & decorations. Ornate & photogenic. If you leave the site in the correct direction, there is a small compound of Vietnam War hardware including tanks & aircraft."
It's an amazing site to visit while in Hue. The buildings were seriously ruined and have been well maintained as it's so important to Vietnamese history. The grounds are vast and beautiful. Should visit while in Hue!
"Amazing place, teeming with ancient and recent history....if the stones could speak. Give yourself the whole day as there is a lot to fit in and wear comfortable footwear for walking as you'll cover a few kilometres"
"The citadel is enormous and very nice. Unfortunately we were there when it rained cats and dogs and the floors are very slippery then, so you will have to be careful while you are walking. Also inside the place, because there are several places where the roofs are leaking. But it sure is worthwhile to visit it"
"Worth a visit, a lot of history. Make sure you wear comfortable footwear and try to go on a sunny day as we had a little rain which made it difficult to get around the citadel."
"The Imperial Citadel Palace Complex is huge and requires much walking. A leisurely stroll within the palace grounds will take at least 1 and a half hours. The largest building where the throne is located has striking gold engravings and looks real grand befitting for an emperor. The rest of the complex has much photos and rather intricate architecture features. A lot to see and browse. There is a small section on Hue's crafts including royal tea, strong rice wines and lacquer as well as other village skills. Take your time and wonder around slowly to enjoy this sprawling complex. A must see destination."
I know that it's a must-see attraction and I would recommend visiting it to my friends but personally I was a little bit disappointed. Imperial city is like 200 years old but it is looking like ancient ruins. Humidity and rains does their job but for me it's just not well maintained.
A very historic location with photos from the early 1900s and an expansive range of buildings. Well worth a visit.
Really beautiful. A must see in hue. It would be a good idea to take a tour guide so you can learn more.
"The Citadel is an interesting place to visit to gain a glimpse of Royal Vietnam.
The size of the complex and the magnificence of the buildings & gardens from time past can be imagined from the remnants that remain.
Do some reading beforehand as signage is limited & the couple of media points are rather outdated.
There are several places to buy water but only a fairly basic cafe near the entry gate.
You can easily spend 2-3 hours here just walking through the entire area.
Watch out for slippery paths as there are many that have moss due to the climate in this region.
Restoration work is in progress so some areas may be closed off.
Definitely worth visiting if you enjoy history."
We really enjoyed this day. The city was mostly rebuilt but it is still really beautifull. It is definitely a place to visit when in Hue
"This is an extensive site with plenty to explore and look at. Unfortunately we arrived rather late with the light fading and so were not able to stay as long as we would have wished, so do make sure you allocate a good couple of hours - I don’t think you will regret it."
"A good review of a royal stance. Huge, massive. Peaceful area inside a busy city. Try to walk arround everywhere. There are hidden galleries you wouldn't miss. Go slow. Relax. Enjoy. Drink a vietnamise coffe outside and come back to your place with a smile."
"This is a must visit place in any trip to Hue ( pronounces “Hoy” from what we were told ). Great history related to the Kingdom of Vietnam - that is, before it became a republic. Covers a huge area and lots of buildings. We had a guide which was a positive. Rain was torrential and we walked, in parts, in about 6 cm of water - thank goodness for the waterproof plastic shoes we bought in Hoi An for $3US and our ponchos and umbrellas !"
We had private guides offered by Mountain Travel SOBEK and they were great . I would recommend seeing and visiting the Citadel for certain
"Visited here in April when it was hot hot hot. I spent about an hour sitting in the little air conditioned cafe in the city trying to get rehydrated after being sick. I spent about three or four hours walking around through the ruins. It was beautiful and amazing to see what the ruling class lived like back then. There descriptions or explanations were few and far in between although its not really a loss as you could tell they were basically google translated to english from Vietnamese. This place would benefit immensely from tour guides or more plaques or a guided audio tour. It was kind of cool you could just walk wherever you wanted, which definitely would not happen in American or European ruins. Still beautiful and worth going if you are in Hue."
"The Citadel is a 2 hour trip around the whole thing with its grand buildings and lovely gardens.

However the Citadel is not well signposted if at all around the site. We were confused as to where to buy tickets from to begin with and had to consult our Lonely Planet book and map throughout the visit.

150000vnd seemed like a steep price for the amount available to the public and although not helped by the rain, the visit was a bit underwhelming.

I would suggest saving this visit for a sunny day if possible."
This is reminiscent of the Forbidden City in Beijing but not as big and not as up together. A lot of the area was destroyed and there is renovation going on but at a slow pace. What would have made it better would have been a better exhibition of “how it was” there is some of that but I think could be improved. Nevertheless less a must see sight
"I love to visit the Citadel, Thien Mu Pagoda, the mausoleum of all the Nguyen Kings with different style of architecture."
If you’ve been to the Forbidden city in Beijing this will seem familiar to you though it is smaller and parts of it have suffered damage. Well worth the visit even in pouring rain.
"It was so hot and sunny outside. Lucky us, we brought some umbrellas, haha. This place is amazing, don't forget to take a lot of pictures. you also should visit every corner in this place. The ticket was somehow expensive, but I think it's reasonable."
"When in Hue, you would of course visit this site, but it does suffer somewhat from disrepair like so much of Nam. If they spruced it up it would be very grand indeed. Take time to visit the many gardens inside the complex, which are adjacent the temples and throne room. Even though the main area was quite crowded during our visit we discovered huge gardens that we had all to ourselves, so most people appear to miss them."
Worth a visit if in Hue. The buildings are amazing as are all the art work. A very interesting piece of history.
Arrived with a local tour and it was pouring. Can imagine how bad it was the sewage system...it flooded all around. The palace and buildings were still fine but you won’t be pleased by wet clothes sticking to your skin.
"The Hue Citadel and Imperial City is an amazing historic site full of Vietnamese treasures, even when toured in Ankle deep floodwaters after the November 4th Typhoon. Didn’t want to miss it so we waded through with able guide Mahn. Impressive and not to be missed!"
"This place is amazing. Great to lost, fantastic for contemplating. I really enjoyed even was raining. I wish to go back there."
"We took the whole family young kids,parents grandparents to the Citadel.It was beautiful & the kids enjoyed the sights as well as feeding the millions of fish.You should add this to your must see itinerary."
"I went here with a tour guide. The history of the palace, the emperors, concubines, eunuchs, servants were very interesting. The Palace itself is a little underwhelming. The throne room is pretty small. That isn’t the exhibit’s fault of course, but just keep that in mind. No pictures in the throne room because the flash previously ruined the paint. Pictures can be taken on the grounds and of the theatre. You have to dress conservatively or else they will not let you into the throne room."
"Expensive for this type of attraction, staff weren’t the most welcoming. Gets very very busy. Prices confusing when we first looked - some include tour guide. Be prepared to queue."
"A must in the city, great history for a great country.
Mr. Hoa from Hue Vacations totally was great, amazing place, incredible history."
"Maybe it was just the rain, but our tour around Imperial City was unpleasant and extremely slippery. Hard to concentrate on exhibits when ur focusing on not slipping over and breaking ur neck."
"$5 entry , amazing buildings you can really see how amazing it once was .We went in very heavy rain and it was still worthwhile. The photographs round the edge are very interesting . Too many tourist shops !"
Spend half a day in here with a guide and learn about the history of the Emperors and their wives and concubines and visit the forbidden city and learn about the power of purple and five and nine. Checkout ironwood columns and roof construction details. A must see if you are in Vietnam
Lots to see and read as you walk around this impressive royal residence. You can easily spend half a day here. About $7 entry
"The day we went it was very wet and many paths were flooded, we could still get around to see the beautiful buildings and grounds. We didn't have s guide and could learn by reading information ourselves as it was translated in English."
"The Hué impérial city is a smaller version of the Forbidden City in Bejing. It’s impressive, but in need of more rehabilitation. However, this is an amazing place with a great deal of information displayed on what went on there for 150 years. Really worth a trip"
"Wow this gorgeous citadel is huge, at 5.2km ensure you have good shoes, water and plenty of time to explore it. It’s 150,000, £5 entrance per adult. Lots of renovation and reconstruction has happened since war and natural disasters took their toll. For an extra few golf buggies will take you around the site, we preferred to walk and take it all in. The site is very peaceful and well worth taking time out in your travels to enjoy its relaxed and laid back feel.

They did have some tacky dressing up opportunities to sit on a fake throne etc, we thought this a little disrespectful in many ways so left it. Food and water are at hiked up prices!

Overall it’s a wonderful place and a must see while in Hue"
A good place to learn about the history and culture of Hue. Just walk around and take a lot of pictures.
"The Citadel of Hue definitely belongs to the thngs you should see when in Hue! It has 10 x 10 km circumference perpendicular to the Perfume River, has the flag tower in its front and the impressive noon gate and houses the imperial city and in there the forbidden city. Although many parts have collapsed or are currently under reconstruction, the district is very impressive and worth seeing; can be explored in about 2 hours. We drove by scooter to the entrance to the imperial city, which can only be accessed from the side of the river. It is worth to buy the combined ticket for this district and the imperial tombs and to see them in a day tour by scooter or taxi."
One of the most amazing places I have ever been! Everybody should come here! It’s pure magic. Every detail makes the difference
"Really interesting place. A great way to imagine the emperor's dynasty, especially seeing the old b&w photos of the musicians and elephants."
"This site is known as the Citadel or the Imperial City or the Hue Fortress. It is a large site surrounded by a wall about 2km by 2km. It dates back to about 1800.

When you walk into the complex, you see a large grassed and paved area inside the wall. High up on the wall is a giant flagpole with a national flag - red with a central yellow star. Then, inside the walls, the citadel buildings are surrounded by a mote.

We spent some time looking through the vast grounds and buildings. I'm sure you could spend all day here to try to take it all in. It's clear that they have gone to a lot of effort to restore this site to its original glory and they are still working on it.

It's a grand site in so many ways - impressive buildings, large plazas or parade grounds, ornate corridors etc. The carvings and artwork are fantastic."
"its a wonderful place to visit in Hue. Very large, you can spend at least 2 hrs to walk around. I really recommend to visit"
"Amazing experience! The best part was the option to dress up as an imperial royalty and pose for pictures on the replica of the throne and royal carriage. If you want an unique souvenir of your trip to Vietnam, this is it! Well worth the price and experience to “travel back in time.” Perfect personalized souvenir to remember your trip."
The Citadel is an impressive complex but to be honest it seemed to us to be surprisingly badly looked after. Just rather tired.
Got here on a rainy day so had large sections pretty much to myself. The Imperial City was a lot like what I’d pictured Vietnam might look like before I came out here. I didn’t really find much else to do in Hue but this definitely made it worth the trip. Signage is scarce but does a fairly good job of explaining what you’re looking at when you do find the odd one about. Spent quite a few hours of the morning and afternoon here and the further out you walk from the entrance area the less tourists you’ll find (and lots of really cool isolated dilapidated structures).
"Probably the major attraction in Hue. A huge sprawling complex as yet not fully restored. Unfortunately we ran out of time to see it properly, but would love to return"
We enjoyed the Citadel it was very interesting .some of it is closed to the public as it is having repairs but still plenty to see We stayed all morning. Take plenty of bottled water and a scarf to cover up. We took loads of photos here.
"A very imposing place to visit but once through the hard facade of the palace you start to see the real beauty of this impressive palace.
Unfortunately i didn't give myself the right amount of time to view this vast complex so didn't get to see the whole place- maybe think about adding more time to your itinerary.
Also i wish i'd had a tour guide as there wasn't a great deal of information to call upon when at the Palace."
"The architecture and all the surroundings were amazing. I am very glad we had a guide with us who was able to explain the significance of much of the art we saw, as well as the many different buildings on the grounds. It rained pretty steadily the whole time we were there, but it never dampened our visit. Even though there were many people there, it did not seem as crowded as some of the other places we visited."
It's an amazing site to visit and the buildings have been well maintained as it's so important to local history. The grounds are vast and beautiful - it was a very hot day and not much shade so I would recommend go early miss the rush
Just the sheer scale of this place is to be seen. Also it helps to have an awesome guide-Thank you Mr Hoa
Just stunning to see this historic site. Amazing architecture and gardens. The tiles are hard so take good soft walking shoes or you will get very tired.
"Great complex full of gardens, ponds and relaxing atmosphere while you visit the different buildings"
"THis is a great place to visit, and a must if you are staying in Hue for a night or two. Recommend a private driver if you a party of two or more."
"Interesting visit to learn the history of the Nguyen Dynasty. Worth the trip, one of the top 5 stops in Hue."
We had danny from hue vacations take us around imperial city informative and shared culture and history found it very enjoyable
"Took group tour. It is impressive from the entry with the giant red star flag of Vietnam to some interesting art, bullet holes left over from Tet offensive( I'm sorry for what my country did)...but what I've learned about Vietnam..it's not the heat but the humudity!😎"
"The Imperial city is really worth a visit. The structure and buildings are very Chinese style. There aren't many people and you can walk on your own and get lost in the several buildings and gardens. If you want to know more about what you see, I'd advice to take a guide or bring a guide book with you since most of the areas don't have signs nor descriptions. Bring comfortable and fresh clothes since most of the citadel is open air and the heat can be heavy."
Huge Citadel and very interesting. Some of it is in ruins from the Vietnam/American war but hey it’s history right. Was absolutely roasting the day we walked round. Take plenty of water!!
"Our visit to the imperial citadel was part of our half day Hue tour.
We visited on a day when the citadel was busy with lots of tours. Our guide did not keep our group together, nor give us much information. Unfortunately, this is not a great attraction without a guide, very easy to get lost. There is a gross lack of sign posts and the grounds are not well kept. This makes it extremely difficult to learn anything about this historically important ancient Vietnamese city.
Even a map leaflet for each ticket would make the tourist experience much more worth while!"
"Beautiful place steeped in history with beautiful buildings. It’s worth investing in a guide so you get the most out of the visit. Try to get there fairly early to miss the crowds as it does get very busy. Thee are some restrictions on photographs in some buildings, but understandable. No bare shoulders or short shorts."
"Despite the destruction, it is well worth a visit. Restorations are undertaken and it will take a while before the former glory is restored. Prepare to walk a little, if you are prepared for the humidity"
"Top must see sight of Hue. The imperial city is close to the banks of the Perfume River, within walking distance of the tourist quarter on the opposite side where most hotels and guesthouses are located. You need at least 2 hours to cover the entire complex- though, a half-day is a better option to really feel its beautiful past and sublime architecture. Put on your walking shoes, bring a large bottle of water, and enjoy."
"You could spend all day in the Citadel, there is so much to see. We were lucky that it wasn't too busy with tour groups. Well worth a visit and give yourself plenty of time. There's a nice coffee shop to have a break"
This is a must see when visiting Hue as it forms part of the history of this town. It is a good way to spend a couple of hours and although a large amount of the citadel was destroyed during the Vietnam war. There is restoration work going on and visitors help fund this important project. There is a great deal of information that explains the history of the place. Although information on their web site indicated they were open all day be aware that entrance to the site closes for lunch which is usually between 12 & 1:30pm.
"Came as part of tour with intrepid. Fantastic complex including temples, throne room and mutiple other rooms and statues. Lovely architecture. Need a half day to explore and ideally with lots of energy. Must do in hue."
We visited this spot as part of our tour. This was ruined a lot during war time but there are still somethings you can visit. Our tour guide was very informative to bring us back to centuries ago when he explained to us a lot a bout history of Vietnam and area. So nice to see things and know about it's life history. Would be nicer if we could have more time here. Recommended!
"This is a very large and impressive site.
We only stayed 2 hours on our tour but you could easily spend half a day to see more of the site and displays.
The buildings are grand and the displays are quite informative.
It's a large area so it takes some time and effort to get around though we did see some buggies taking people around.
Very good to visit."
we had vacation with my husband in Hue for 2 day.This place it was very old and very impresived with us.We went to forbiden city lovely contrustion from the monarchy.We ejoyed very much and will get back next time
Fascinating! Interesting revelation of the history of the Nguyen dynasty and Vietnam under imperial and French rule.
"Historical place of Vietnam, as it was the capital city earlier. The painting in the museum was really amazing, very artistic, which speak about the culture, heritage."
"Lovely private guided tour which was informative and relaxed. Guide was informed and informative, site was beautiful and for us not crowded."
We visited the place just after the typhoon and it was flooded with fish swimming on the sidewalks. Still we spent 2h there and enjoyed it.
"A very interesting tour showing the lavish and cultural side of the previous Kings.

The stone carvings, the layout and buildings are a fascinating glimpse into the country's Imperial heritage."
"Here you find some of the milestone of Vietnam history, it as here that the Vietnam Emperator gave up his power to the Viet Minh, tyhe place it is massive and beautiful, it will take more than half day to see it."
Excellent guide Danny for our city tour on Sunday 29th Oct. Fascinating tour of Imperial City followed by boat trips on Perfume River
"We signed up a 4hours tour with Bee bee travel. The guide ran through the entire citadel with fascinating stories about Vietnam's last dynasty, the Nguyen dynasty. The dynasty way of life reminded us of the chinese dynasty, having been ruled by them for over 1000 years. It's good to go with a tour as you'll get an informative dose of the overall picture but the tour is still too short to really savour the experience."
Aim to spend best part of a day wandering around this amazing place. Be warned not many places for food or drink once inside. Take your camera for some lovely photos.
"The Inner city (the Palace and government offices) was destroyed as high as 85% by bombs during Vietnam War, so the buildings are mostly renovated and reconstructed and mostly not complete yet. However, it still a must go and worth to go place. That is the purpose for most tourists coming to Hue. The buildings in the palace, were mixed in An Nan(Old name of Vietnam) style, southern China style, and Northern China Palace style-and of curse very nice. However, because of its' quantity and conditions, it is not the most magnificent to compare to some foremost traditional style architecture.
The things mostly attracting me were the writing on the Plaque by kings and mandarins. At traditional time, also like Chinese empire, the Vietnam king has to be extremely well educated, and many high status mandarins were not only powerful government officers but also the highly achieved and profiled artist and calligraphist in their education, competition and promotion background. These are magnificent.
I love all beautiful hand writing (traditional Chinese) on plaque by different generations. I think their writing can be recognized the highest level, spectacular and extremely beautiful in Chinese calligraphy. Actually, Vietnam kingdom until the last dynasty in1940s, (even many people may call it a French puppet) still kept very authorized and traditional Chinese format government institution and system, even later than China its self, which became the republic nation 40 year earlier than Vietnam. The calligraphist in Hue Palace was the top level of achievement, beautiful and meaningful even beat Chinese. Fortunately I can read through all the characters, sentence, and poem and understand and meaning, and make me to know more deep content."
Wonderful restaured after destruction in the vietnam war. Shows a lot of history. Used a local guide...
"This is a must visit in Hue. With 150vnd to enter per person. If you want to explore this citadel I would give yourself at least half a day and you better get a tour guide to explain about things. This world heritage site ruined a lot during 2 wars in Vietnam, but there is still plenty to enjoy. Inside the first main temple you can watch a short CGI film showing how the city once looked-amazing. We highly recommend to see this spot whilst in Hue."
"It's so peaceful to walk around this massive complex admiring the architecture, engaging with the history, and enjoying the sounds of nature. If you're visiting Hue, you really can't miss this awesome, central site, and with affordable entrance fees, there's absolutely no reason to. Just be sure to wear conservative clothing (no visible knees, cleavage, shoulders or stomachs) or bring a scarf that you can fashion into a shawl or skirt when entering certain buildings. We paid for a package ticket to the Royal Palace, the Khai Dinh Tomb, the Tu Duc Tomb, and the Minh Manh Tomb. As the final three destinations are quite a way out of Hue, one of the guards manning the Palace exit very kindly negotiated with a taxi driver on our behalf and arranged to have us transported to all three tombs and finally back to our accommodation at a very reasonable price. I'd definitely recommend visiting these tombs if you have time, because they're utterly spectacular! However, the Royal Palaces themselves were loaded with fascinating information, beautiful gardens, stunning architecture, and friendly staff, making them well worth a visit in their own right!"
"We were really excited to visit the imperial city, but we were disappointed. It was quite expensive to get in, and maybe these are much needed funds to restore the sites. The site, given it’s not that ‘old’ is fairly derelict, which, if there was signage explaining what happened, would’ve be a problem as you would have the history to explain it away and the lack of information made self-guided options difficult. I don’t agree with complete reconstruction of a site which is what they seem to be done by in part."
An interesting historic sight with great history. Some areas still need restoration to return it to its glory days.
"Over priced, not kept up, garbage laying around, places selling paintings etc. No pamphlet and minimal signage to guide or explain."
This place goes on and on ... It is huge! Our guide was excellent in giving us its history. Great use of time!
The conservation efforts to rebuild this site following the war have definitely made this a place that is worth seeing. A number of the structures are very well maintained and are open to the public to view. It provides a unique insight into how the Emperors lived and worked.
"If visiting Hue take the time to walk through the citadel. Beautiful garden and very historic. A great getaway from busy Vietnam, it is so peaceful."
"We weren't given a map or any information to walk around with so without Google we wouldn't know anything about the place.

It's pretty but needs looking after better. Lots of overgrown plants etc.

Worth a lot but don t expect to spend a long time here."
"Like the forbidden city in Bejing. But still lots to be restored. Take 1,5 hours. Bring some water. Best with a guide. Make sure to dress appropriately: Not too short shorts, shoulders covered"
"The trip to the imperial city begins with crossing by foot or by riksha/ motorbike the bridge from the side of the city where most the tourists live. For us it took about half an hour walk. So the first thing u see is the citadel, then u show ur ticket ( bought before ) and then ener the beatiful imperial city.
My mark is only 3 because not all the buildings are so amazing and nowadays 60% are under restauration or construction..... €njo¥;)"
"Hue and the Imperial Citadel are so amazingly beautiful I am so glad we took a day to explore this. We hired a car from our Hoi An hotel and explored the Citadel on our own. It was impressive! We made this into a day trip, from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm. We stopped at the Pagoda of the Celestial Lady and the royal tomb of Khai Dinh--both also unbelievably beautiful. We also stopped at Marble Mountain on the way there, which I thought was kind of weird with it's piped-in Mozart music. I would recommend skipping that part. But otherwise, the day trip to Hue was a really, really great day."
I have seen lots of pictures and read about the battle the US marines fought here. On visiting it was all I thought and more. It did not even hint at fighting. It beautifully covered the history of the palace and the influence of the French. The photos were great. Our guide did a very good job of filling in about all the bits. I liked the walls and moats. The whole place was mind blowing 👍👍👍
"The imperial palace in Hue is a lovely place to spend a few hours. 70% of it was destroyed during the war but , with the help of UNESCO, it's being renovated. It explains a lot about the Vietnamese Imperial family and gives the history."
"Expecting big things after reading some reviews, but not great to be honest. I struggle to see how people give this place 5 stars, ye it's a bit different - but nothing compared to other historical places in Italy for example.
Also a rip off at 150k for entry, even Sam Tarly wouldn't pay that to get into a Citadel"
"This is quite a big site if you want to cover all of it.
Work is still in progress restoring bits.
We winged it with a guide book as we like to go our own pace and tend to get bored by the guides who after all are doing this because it is their thing.
Visited with a combination tombs and citadel ticket which saves approx 100 vnd.
Pleased we did this on a separate day to the tombs, it made it more relaxed.
None of the sights in Hue are particularly old a couple of hundred years, shamed it got bombed to pieces in such a short time."
"Very interesting and so much to see. Worth the experience
We caught a taxi so we didn’t have an early start. For us it was the best way and missed the early rush"
Not the most interesting. It only dates back a couple of hundred years at most and much of it has been damaged or destroyed in the war. Its a tranquil spot and pleasant to wander around.
You need to be ready to walk in this vast imperial city but it is really worth it. It is very well preserved and maintained. A must-visit if you are around Hué.
"Was amazing seeing the 1800s fortifications of an Ancient City. Lots of history there, and alot to take in."
"Similar to most tourist attractions in Vietnam, it's set up to milk the money out from tourists. 150000 VND for entrance, 150000 VND for 30 mins tour guide, and 300000 VND/hour for electric car rental. No brochure/map was given to the tourists considering this is a large compound, it'll be good to look at a map when going around. Many places were closed for renovations with the signs just outside the buildings rather than at the entrance, so I walked pass the garden with tall grass & weeds, a few doors and long pathway, just to find that the building is closed.

If you have plenty of time in Vietnam, want to visit a historical place, and you are not far away, Hue is good. Will I recommend people to fly in from far away just for Hue? No."
"This is a really iconic Hue tourist attraction and I can see why. Just an amazing piece of history and so sad that it was such a victim of the Vietnamese/American war. Nice to see them doing restoration work even if it will take them a long time to get it back to what it was. Seems to be being done sympathetically.

Our guide made a real difference to the experience ensuring we saw all the main sites without having to spend hours and hours in here. You need nearly 2 hours to see this site properly even then."
"The buildings in the Imperial City were nearly all destroyed in 1968 during the Têt offensive, and the Vietnamese have been rebuilding ever since. They think it will take another 15 years to complete the task. Nevertheless, what has been renovated or rebuilt is true to the original design, and uses local artisans to do the work. The buildings are absolutely beautiful and deserve a visit. The grounds are huge, and one should plan at least three hours to visit. Highly recommended. Please, hire a guide, or join a small tour group, as the buildings without explanation lose their true meaning."
"It's fun to walk around the Citadel, but it has relatively little to offer that is old, authentic, or aesthetically pleasing. The most interesting items are the photos from 1900-1930, which do a better job than the ""museum"" of bring Imperial Vietnam to life."
"A shore excursion was arranged for our group of 400 persons to Hue and one of the places was the Imperial Palace at Hue. The outer perimeter wall which is 20 meters thick and 6 meters high is said to be around 10 kilometers long. Another two walls have to be crossed to enter the royal Pavillion.

The Royal Pavillion has been totally obliterated by American bombs because the Viet Cong used the palace grounds a hiding places during the height of the Vietnam war. The entire royal pavillion grounds has been left bare with only short grass covering the field where the palace once stood. Only ancient photographs of the place remain.

There is not much shopping to be done at this place and what little you can find are over priced. Same goes for the shops were tour buses were parked.

If you do a tour of the royal palace you have to commit to a bit of walking. The palace grounds is extensive so wear practical shoes. Be informed that the walking path is quite slippery during the rain as moss covered tiles could be treacherous.

You are not allowed to double back and exit through the entrance portal. The is one way traffic for tourists which is why you really need to be determined to walk. It pays to have a Tour Guide familiar with the history of this place.

Get a Tour Guide if possible."
A lot of new historical information for me. Great place to come in Hue. But some part of the citadel need to protect.
A great place and some wonderful sights and food. Well worth a visit! We only stayed a short time but 2 days would be well worth it.
This spot is huge to walk around and really good to learn about the history of Hue and Vietnam. But make sure you have a tour guide to explain about everythings.
Historical buildings which is of Chinese history with nothing much to see. Would be a great place to visit if have not visited China's Imperial City
Interesting insight with alot to see. Can be enjoyed leuisurely. Well worth a visit if you are have a morning or afternoon free. Easy to get to on foot or with a bike from the centre
"Even if u stay for one day, this trip is doable and u can learn a lot even without a guide. Most of the hotels are in walking distance of this tourist attraction which is a plus if u want to save some taxi money"
I have been to the Forbidden City in Beijing. The Citadel is a smaller version. You need to spend at least 2 hours here to see the sights. This is the do not miss place in Hue!
An interesting walk about with lots to absorb and see with official guide there is a theatre with re enactment of the entertainment that was done for the emperor and his concubines. Also gift shops art gallery and coffee shop with wifi to relax after viewing gardens and temples etc.
We spent a rainy morning wondering around the grounds. Some of the buildings have been restored while the work on others are still in progress. Someday this is really going to be a remarkable historical site
Worth having a guide to explain what you're seeing. Amazing decoration on the buildings & full of history.
"This site is extraordinary and worth a visit to Hue just for this. You will need more than a few hours, maybe days, to see and understand all.
It is a world heritage site, I think, if not it should be. Quite incredible!"
"We came here on our own, but would be nicer if with the tour guide to explain about the site. Anyway this is still a good place, where to know more about history of Vietnam."
Well preserved history of ancient Vietnamese kingdom. The imperial scriptures are vivid and all in Chinese. Be ready with a pair of good walking shoes. We spent about 1 hour and 40 minutes in the citadel but could only cover 2/3 of the whole area.
"The main gates and first pavilion are very impressive. The rest of the site is compounded with ruins and some restored royal houses.
We visited in October and the site was all ours with very little tourists (apart from the tour bus groups which come take pics and leave within minutes).
We recommend taking some time to watch the short video showing how the place once looked like before it was bombed in the 2 wars they had.
Overall, I was not much impressed despite some beautiful pavilions and fine architecture but it is part of your Hue trip."
"She glided into the hotel lobby, dressed in pink purple traditional Vietnamese outfit, silk flowing ‘ao dai’ elegantly set with
coordinating gold shoes & handbag - her name was Văn our Guide for the day. We walked to the side of our river hotel to board a boat which chugged us up the Perfume River. Van was informative, very historical knowledgeable & delightful to converse with. The Imperial City was awesome Van’s explanations of Vietnamese history illuminating. Two Imperial tombs mid blowing, beautiful & awesome. On this tour we enjoyed the best ‘day trip’ lunch, written separate Tip-advisor Review, ever experienced through my many travel years - it was a perfect day.
Organized by Buffalo Tours"
Five visits to Vietnam and this our first time to Hue. Can't believe we have been missing this. Visited Citadel and allowed 2 hours. Not enough time to take in this amazing place. Should have allowed three hours. Wonderful history and architecture.
"It may not be as spectacular as the forbidden city in Beijing, but this is a really nice way to get a glimpse at ancient Vietnam. We spent a couple of hours and felt like we saw everything we needed to. Make sure you wear appropriate clothing that covers your knees and shoulders."
"This is definitely the MUST SEE place in your trip but recently there are some updates about dressing. Like the photos below, you now have to prepare so you can enter some of the important palaces or temples in side. A new product is THE ROYAL PALACE BY NIGHT which is another effort to show tourists some activities happens in the past . The entrance fee is 150k, 50% of if you're already visit in the day time. The highlight programs are from 7 till 9p.m.."
"Was a short walk from our hotel across the bridge to the imperial city, cost $60,000 Đồng per person, was amazing seeing the walled palace and walking around taking photos, be sure to keep shoulders and knees covered and signed as you walk in, recommend it to anyone stay in hue for a few days"
"I was a bit disappointed it how touristy the Citadel is. You pay 150,000 VD (totally reasonable) to get in and view what was once an amazing city that has lasted thousands of years, but is barely standing after the war. There are lots of videos spread around with information about the different emperors and dynasties that ruled from there.

There is a noticeable lack of directional signage making it easy to get turned around. We had to really stop and think on how we had come in and where we walked in order to figure out how to reach the exit.

Definitely the best part for me was an artist selling his amazing paintings at one of the (MANY) gift shops. His work was great and very reasonable priced - we bought 2 pieces.

If you want to experience the history and learn more about the dynasties that built Vietnam, this is certainly a place to visit."
"Hue's Imperial City is vast, with lots of enticing, overgrown and atmospheric corners and gardens that you could happily spend hours exploring. Tourists congregate around the entrance, the 9 dynastic urns, and the living complex of the mothers of the emperors, but beyond those places you may well be by yourself pottering around some dilapidated temples of exquisitely maintained gardens.

It would be quite useful to have a guide as much of the complex was destroyed during the American War and only mysterious remnants remain, and there's little in the way of explanations available, so you may just end up taking in the faded grandeur and scale rather than coming away with a real understanding of imperial life in the 1800s...

If you're going to visit the Imperial Tombs to the south of the city (easily done on a half-day tour in a taxi or on a motorbike) then get yourself a combo ticket which includes the 3 most monumental mausoleums and the Imperial City and saves you a couple of bucks."
"We arrived in Hue after a day tour at around 3:30 and knew we were leaving early the next day to tour the caves but were determined to visit the Citadel. We ended up with xtra time here with it closing till 6 pm or so and it was getting to dark by then to fully appreciate. What an amazing spectacular place. Sorry we didn’t have more time but we did pretty well getting around about 3/4 in less than 2 hours. We took lots of Photos but nothing can replace being here in person. Be respectful and wear long pants that cover the knees or a long skirt, otherwise you may be restricted. We could not understand the comments about some of it being overgrown. The majority was either amazing or in the process of being restored and this is to be respected. Don’t miss this place. Make the most of any time you can spend. An added bonus in being late was that we could take lots of photos without a lot of tourists being in the way! There were very few people left which made it extra enjoyable."
My husband and I loved this- my kids a little less so- to be expected. Still- not to be missed when in Hue!
Excellent history here but with a good guide you will learn so much more. A smaller version of China’s forbidden city.
"We spent about an hour in The Citadel. It was pleasant & peaceful to walk around, with a strong sense of history. Our visit was during rainy season so it was relatively quiet. I had heard a lot about the place before the visit, but was a little underwhelmed by the experience."
A very large and complex monument/city. The structure is more or less symmetric but of course in different compartments.
"Went here with a tour group, learnt about thw ways of the kings ladies and how the queens mother has her own areas."
Seeped in history a place of calm and tranquility a must visit when in Hue . It ids worth every dong of the entrance fee.
"WE went here with a guide which I think is a must as there is so much you can learn about different places, although I think we were glazing over a little by the time she took us through the info on the last Emperor, but it was really hot that day as well.
The Emperors mother small temple where you can get a cool drink is very nice to sit and reflect.
It has an awful lot of history there and it is a shame that the US bombed so much of the place in the war.
Also seems a shame that the last Emperor sold out to the French and that is basically it no more Emperors. But worth a visit. the restoration work is really amazing and so much gone into it as well."
"This is a World Heritage site, equal in its way to Angkor Thom in Cambodia. But it doesn't make headlines - why? Much of the site was destroyed by a cyclone and two wars but what is left is being lovingly restored. The whole site is geometrically symmetrical and the throne room is just fantastic. If you came there yo meet the emperor, you would be in awe. It's not dripping in gold but the sturdy teak pillars, the variegated roof and the gold throne are very impressive. Don't miss the Korean video which shows how the buildings were constructed. Pity you e trance ticket doesn't include a map."
The Citadel is an icon of Vietnam. It is the palace of the Ngyuen emperors..complete with a forbidden city which used to house the concubines and eunochs who could never leave! Absolutely fascinating
150vnd to enter per person. If you want to explore this citadel I would give yourself at least half a day. The Vietnamese are slowly renovating this world heritage site but there is still plenty to enjoy. Inside the main temple you can watch a short CGI film reconstructing how the city once looked-amazing. A must see whilst in Hue.
"Thanks VM Travel for our plan trip, we feel great! The staff is also very friendly, especially Ms. Ngan, the service is very good, we will come again."
We joined a short city tour in the morning and visited the Citadel and tour guide was very helpful and explained the meanings of all attractions we visited. And this place is definitely one of the great parts of Vietnam's history
Absolutely amazing. A must do. Take your camera!!! Why the King was brave enough to have so many concubines beggars belief!:-) You could spend a whole day here if you liked....
"We visited the imperial citadel at around 7pm and came back the next day during daytime to compare pictures. The evening experience was, by far, much better! They held performances such as the imperial guards training and fire performance, musicians, singers, and even a theater show. The lights at the citadel add a great touch to the architecture. The ticket prices were the same (150,000 VND/pax). The ONLY issue was navigation. They have maps inside the citadel but they aren’t very clear nor strategically positioned by the entrance. Not to mention you can’t exit through the entrance. That being said... I’d recommend taking a picture of the map once you find it in order to be able to see all the performances at their schedule times, locations, and not volunteering to being a sequel of “Night at the museum” and be able to exit the citadel by closing time.

On the other hand, during daytime you get to see the lovely pond by the cafe at the Dien Tho Residence where you can feed the fish.

NOTE: they won’t let you go inside the palace with (short) shorts (women) or sleeveless shirts (both men and women). But you’re allowed everywhere else."
We did a guided tour inside the palace. Is very well maintained and big enough to expend couple of hours. 50mt out is the museum.
"Firstly, the only entrance is through the palace at a price of 150,000VND each, cover shoulder and legs if you want to go inside the temple. If on a moped best to leave by the guard, don't drive around the one way system is a nightmare!!! Once inside is very pretty to look at but can't spend much time there so price seems expensive. Guards on the doors are not the most friendly."
Lots to see around. Easy to spend few hours there. Have some cafes and you can buy water in a few places. Amazing historical site
"Beautiful experience walking and exploring the citadel. Amazing restoration work throughout the complex. Be prepared to walk - it's quite large and nice to take your time. Plenty of shops along the way to rest, have a drink and chat. Don't miss the Royal Theatre - stunning room."
"It was nice but we did not enjoy it much. However, our guide made us relax a bit with his untold strories of Kings and royal family."
Can highly recommend you include the imperial city of Hue in a private city tour. Wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot of walking involved.
We found the assistance of a local guide a real bonus for this visit. We learnt so much from him about the history and ongoing maintenance and restoration of the Imperial City. Well worth the investment in our view.
A not to be missed highlight. Beautiful architecture and so much history! Shame quite a bit was destroyed by the US in the late 60's.
"The Hue Imperial City is a place you must visit while visiting Hue. We spent half a day and enjoyed it very much, so much to see at such a big place. Very interesting!"
A long 2 hour tour in the heat to see not very much. The tour guide was very knowledgeable but having already seen the Forbidden City in Beijing it was all very much the same
"Amazing place. Great to just wander and look and see. We didn't have a guide and while we enjoyed the day, a guide would have been good to help explain exactly what was what. Thoroughly enjoyable experience in a fantastic city."
"Learned a lot about history and through it, we found out more about Vietnam and its people in this new century"
Went here for an afternoon walk. It just kept on giving. Large spaces. Quiet. Lovely architecture. Is in the long process of being restored with no end date in sight. But a must visit when in Hué.
"We visited this place while in Hue with a private tour guide and it's essential to understand everything about the history of this site.
A very beautiful piece of art of a site with good maintenance of the place.
A must."
This was my BFs first trip to Vietnam since he left 30+ years ago. We went to the Citadel to learn about the history of Vietnam and saw how the Vietnam war destroyed the grounds. They are trying to rebuild it back to the way it was before the war. It was neat to see the model of how it used to be vs how it is now. Some of the architecture still standing is beautiful.
"I came there with my friends on a sunny day in earlyof this september. I was a very nice tour. We got Thuy as our guide. She so informative and helpful. She explained all with big love of her city. The citadel is old, ruin but has lots to see. I also saw tombs of kings used to rule the whole country. They were really peaceful and green. Bun bo Hue's also excellent. Every is perfect."
If your in Hue you must visit the imperial city to understand the history and influence Hue had on Vietnam as a whole. It costs about 150vnd to enter for the day and is nice to walk around. Bring a hat and plenty of water if you are going mid day as there is little shade. Cool old buildings with a lot of restoration going on.
"Not much to see except a citadel and royal tombs, the Perfume River is the Yarra on a good day with very little to see.

From Danang it was 3 hours travel by road, save yourself the effort and spend an extra day in Hoi An or Danang.

Massively disappointing city!"
"Called the Citadel it is a Unesco World Heritage Site. It is a huge construction by the first emperor of the Nguyen dynasty. The temples, pavilions, walls, and gates were damaged first by the French in 1947, and then by the American forces in 1968. There is a melancholic air about the place, the lake and the deserted pavilions, the symbol of a lost and somehow forgotten world."
"Interesting, lots to see and learn about. Some of the buildings are newly built to replace those that got damaged in the war (ask your guide which these are).
Remember to wear clothes covering shoulders and knees."
"If you want to see an amazing historical Imperial City this is a must.
Grab a tour guide who knows the history and your jaw will drop.
We had no idea that this place existed and were totally in awe.
Can only imagine what it would of been like prior to the war when many buildings were destroyed.
Must see !!!!"
We opted for an private evening tour to avoid the daytime heat... definitely worth it! We were still able to get good pictures & the place was less crowded..only a few locals (it was a Sunday & most people were at a bar probably). We saw the guard exchange & multiple shows throughout the grounds. Our guide provided us with history & other information..but didn't drown us in a history lesson. A must-see in Hue.
"Hue Imperial City. There have many old building, Beautiful architecture. if u visited there it feel like u r in china but smaller. Fresh air and
peaceful. u don't missed when u go there."
"We had arranged our trip to visit the imperial city as part of our package in the U.K. so we knew that we would be waking around here, and we were glad to have visited. It does help to have an English speaking guide. Interesting place to visit and have the meanings of certain drawings and carvings explained to you. Can get hot when waking round so water and hats may be a good thing to take with you. Beautiful walkways and garden areas. This is pretty much the only big thing to do or see in Hue so once you have been round then that's that. Worth a visit, can take 3-4 hours to walk round to get the most out of the visit."
"I didn't go inside the Citadel (my friends did), but even from the outside it is very scenic and historic.

In the evening, I sat outside the Citadel and drank coffee (very strong) with a lady friend. It was very nice to see the Citadel from a local coffee shop.

My friends reported to me that the Citadel is huge inside."
"The place is nice and has a few really nice halls. But as most of its glory was destroyed, there is a lot of construction and restoration ongoing. Still glad we went there!"
"We found that place very nice for a visit. It's quiet and there are nice buildings to visit. From the outside, it looks like a military place but it's not quite the same inside. Some buildings have very nice colors. yellow and red is everywhere. Some green space separate them. The american war destroyed lots there; you can imagine here and there a bulding that didn't made it. Inside buildings, there's figurine and sometimes old pictures of the time. Being built after 1800, it's not that old. We spent 2 hours visiting the citadel. We took our time and it was worth it. When buying tickets for the visit, we could buy some for the emperor's tomb that are around the city. You'll spare money buying as a package."
"Not worth the 7.5 dollars they charge. Nice citadel but not worth a visit, go drink coffe instead....."
"Very good
Very nice
Very interesting
Very impressive
A must see
Don't do the short one hour tour because then you miss a lot we spent over three hours and needed the time."
"Spent half a day walking round exploring, so interesting and so beautiful.

Negatives:
- lack of info or signage inside.
- limited places to get water and food (which you need)
- ticket price is quite expensive given the above points."
We enjoyed a tour around the outside of the Citadel as we were aiming at the Vinh Moc Tunnels and return to Da nang in one day. This is an amazing structure and driving around the perimeter enabled us to have a speed view of it. The inside would be even more delightful. Aim at early in the day before it heats up too much. Was a good place to visit.
This place is massive and if you went there without any research you will got lost and walking around. It took long time for me to walked nearly all over the citadel and it was tiring because the weather was really hot. It's better to take a tour here so that you can only visit some main places and not waste time. Overall really good place to understand Vietnamese history.
Very interesting history of the old kings and ancient life. Beautiful old buildings. Lovely inlays of ceramics and carvings. Very hot in September.
"The Imperial Palace in Hue is a huge complex of palaces, ramparts and audience halls which gives a great insight into the time when Vietnam had its own empire."
"The Citadel is magnificent I highly recommend visiting in the evening when it is cooler, less crowded and under the beautiful lights"
Sweltering in the heat of late morning/early afternoon in September we still found this place amazing. No visit to Hue is complete without seeing this place. You need to allow at least a couple of hours to give it justice.
"My mother and I went in the day on our own. We took our own sweet time to explore the place and it is eye opening. We spent about 2.5 hours in the city.

I like how the ticket system work for the entrance. The entrance gate is magnificent, the restored work and some old walls allow us to be lost in time. The ancient architecture is impressive and the whole imperial city gives an insight of how well organized and systematic the dynasty was. It gives an overview of the culture of and the luxurious lifestyle of the dynasty.

Tips: 1. take a photo at the entrance as that was where the officials used to line up. 2. Allow yourself 1.5-2 hours to explore the place slowly. 3. Watch the 10min film at the Thai Hoa Palace, it is very informative. 4. Go to the Co Ha Garden and the north part of the city to see where the royals used to stroll and spent their free time. 5. Snap a photo of the map of the place right after the entrance to help navigating your way (I only saw two maps in the whole place, there might be more. They didn't provide a map pamphlet.)

Things to improve: 1. Include more maps if pamphlet is not given. 2. Include more description/history of the buildings or guards who can explain a little.

Overall it is a good visit and I find VND150k worth as it helps restore the place. I will recommend this!"
"It is a magnificent citadel, with great stories and an intriguing history. I would definitely suggest going with a guide that is well versed in the history. The Bonsai garden is magnificent!"
"Beautiful place with a lot of history behind it and significant meaning. However, if you don't go with a guide I can't imagine you'd learn very much! Let me know if you'd like the contact details of the cheap but briliant freelancer we used for a private tour!"
"It's worth going for a visit, bring your guidebook as it's a sprawling site.

Make sure you have enough water with you!"
"Great history. Try to get a good English speaking guide. Lots of walking involved. Better to go with registered guide, certified tag."
Historical home of the Nguyen Kings. Original capitol of the country. An easy walk on flat ground. Well worth a visit.
"We visited on our own, walking to citadel from the other side of town and using a guidebook, the placards, and an occaisional video on the premesis as our only interpretation. Many of the tours we investigated included the citadel, and we were really happy we didn't take one of those. We easily spent 3+ hours just wandering around the grounds. The history is interesting, and many of the buildings are quite beautiful. It might have been nice to pay for a tour guide for one sight (many were waiting out front), but we couldn't imagine trying to rush through the Citadel in order to see 5-8 other sights on the same day. I would definitely recommend seeing this separately from a Hue tour so that you can take as much or as little time as you please.

Finally, at the front gate you can buy tickets for the Citadel and 2 or 3 of the tombs all together for a discount (280,000-360,000 VND) and then visit them over 2 days, with or without a tour or a guide. This will save you on the entry fees if you plan to visit more than one place."
"An incredible place to visit and experience more Vietnamese history. We found the size quite extraordinary, the fact it had housed a small city. Some lovely buildings and quite another site to see the damage of bullets on the gates and walls from the last Vietnam War. This is a must to see in Hue."
The citadel is the jewell of the city and therefore a must see. Take a tour with a knowledgeable guide so your experience can be complete!
"Gradually restoring this Amazing piece of history, the final Nguyen Dynasty
amazing buildings, some in ruins, some restored, I was inspired by our guide on the history. A great afternoon soaking up the history and culture (a tad hot)"
"By no means this old imperial city is comparable to the one in China, but it has its own beauty and glamour. It was low season, so not many people around, and we were able to take pictures and enjoy the visit without the crowd.

If you're planning to visit the tombs, then there is an admission package of 280,000 dong/person that you can get for the 2 tombs and The Citadel. Otherwise, you can pay separately."
"I visited this location with some friends. Whilst I was fascinated by the Nguyen Dynasty history, I felt the entry fee was rather over priced for what it is."
"It was very hot when we looked around, this is probably better visited early in the morning or late afternoon. It must have been beautiful, but was virtually destroyed by bombing. The main hall has been reconstructed and gives an idea of its past splendour."
"Expected more splendor but the wars ruined it
Historically extremely important
The final Nguyen dynasty before Communist rule"
"Visited the citadel this week but was quite disappointed to find that it was not what I expected. A trishaw took us on a ride around the old city but the ride was quite disappointing with a couple of stops but nothing interesting.
The citadel itself was not well kept and some of the old walls are in the state of disrepair. The lawns was overgrown with tall grass."
"Really words are inadequate - around every corner there was just a stunning scene and our local guide was amazing in sharing the history and answering questions.
Highly recommend a visit perhaps with a small group or privately to hear as much (or little) history as you want.
Great for teens too as the contrasting scenes kept them interested!"
"There's lots to see here so be prepared for lots of walking!

The architecture is impressive and there are some good displays, but it can be difficult to navigate and some areas are currently closed for renovation. Beware that some of the signposted attractions are ruined so there's nothing to see.

Beware of getting taxis from outside."
"Even this citadel was destroyed during 70 years of war in Vietnam, but they renovated and sometimes rebuilt parts of it on a professional way. The entrance fee - if you buy a combined ticket which allows you to visit the Royal tombs as well - is 360.000 vnd. I spent there 6 hours, but there are still parts of it what I couldn't see because of the huge area. Unfortunately the houses of the king, the queen and the king's parents are dtotally destroyed, only their foundations remain. Around the citadel there are lots of scammers, so be careful."
"To understand more about Hue or Vietnam dynasty and king, this is the place that you need to visit. Though part of the palace were destroyed by the West foreigners in the past, however with Vietnam government effort, this palace are restored part by part. The design is surely different from China Forbidden City as certain parts had western influence and the architecture is build with Feng Shui and the 5 Elements - Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth. If you look closely you will notice that some building or fortress gate is painted with the five elements Green, Yellow, Blue, Red and White."
The city is worth viewing for the size alone - so impressive and amazing grounds. Great to go with a knowledgeable guide - fascinating history ( despite not being that old). Definitely worth a visit.
"Having been a bit tempted out if I am honest we went to the Forbidden City with mixed feelings but came out having had the best few hours ever. The place is vast, our guide was good but not boring and there was lots to see and learn about. Highly recommend this to anyone"
The citadel was nice to visit but very busy and very overpriced and the whole place is under reconstruction consider other places first but still worth a visit
"Most reviews on TripAdvisor mention that the Citadel is quite good 'but very large, and not original for a large part'.

While technically true, I feel like this doesn't matter, as long as you visit the Citadel with a good tour guide. Also, if you happen to visit Hue during the low season (September, start of October), definitely go there because it is that much better without the large crowds.

The area is huge and there is a lot to see. While about 80% of the Citadel was destroyed by the French and Americans, restauration works are continuously being performed with the help of UNESCO and several countries, and they are very precise and true to the original. The results are stunning.

The entire Citadel takes about 3 hours to visit with a good guide. We recommend Hóa Van Pham, a freelance guide who speaks English very well and charges a very fair price (150000 VND total in our case, during low season). Contact details: phamvanhoa28@gmail.com . Tickets cost 150000 per person."
"I really enjoyed a tour of this location, it was very informative (history of the kings) They are reconstructing areas that were destroyed but they are doing it well."
The Hue Imperial City if all rebuilt will be a fascinating place to visit. The insight that it provides of the last monarchy and its royal courts is rich and valuable for generations to come. Much needs to be done to restore the devastated remains. The stories to be told with a magnificient backdrop would be a definite plus to the people of Hue and its visitors. As is the relics are a good re-trace of Hue's spectacular past. The imperial museum next to it is another gem to preserve and showcase the treasures. Good for a 2-hr visit.
"This is the most important attraction of the city. It is a ""must see"" of this town and it is beautiful. Also historically it is vary valuable."
"We arrived in Hue in the afternoon and after we checked in, our hotel told us we should go visit the Citadel. We set of immediately as we didn't want to waste a minute on our trip. It was a 30 minute walk which was further than it felt as it was so hot!
We weren't even at the entrance before we saw some of the Citadel as there is the large flag tower out the front and stone gate you have to walk through.

We paid the fee, went through the entrance gate and after that point, I think I walked around with my mouth agape admiring the stunning buildings, walls, gates, temples and shrines. There is so much to see here. We spent over two hours just wandering around and taking a lot of photos. This would have to be my favourite place of our trip.

Now, I must add that the Citadel may not appeal to everyone. I love architecture and I like to see real and raw things. Also, because we walked around so much, we gave ourselves heat exhaustion, so make sure you watch your fluid intake!"
We visited the imperial city and the tombs of the emperors today and found it to be a very educational experience. Our guide Ha Thanh (Dylan) from Hue Booking Tour was great and very knowledgeable about the city and tombs. He was able to answer all our questions (and we had quite a few) and then took us to a local place to eat lunch the 'Banana & Mango' where we had a very tasty and enjoyable meal. Overall we had a fantastic day and throughly recommend a visit.
"This Massive City Complex is well worth a visit if you are in Hue.Take a Guided tour, watch the Video presentation and do not rush through the buildings.
Every Building has its characteristic Architecture.Restoration work is still continuing.
Be prepared for the Heat if you are visiting in Mid day."
"First time you visited Imperial (Dai Noi), it helps us more information about Nguyen Dynasty. If we have a chance we will come back here. Thanks"
We had a tour guide with active asia and he was very knowledgeable and the place is amazing. The must see of Hue.
"Beautiful and interesting. Need your walking shoes, bottled water and sun protection. We had a guided tour which I would highly recommend as her information was invaluable. If your in Hue you must visit!"
"Firstly you need to have umbrella / cap, water and comfortable shoes.
A lot of walking due to this place is big.
Incredibly historic place, a place like Forbidden City in China.
Spend at least 2-3 hours.
Get ready your camera, you can take pictures.
It opens everyday."
"This is one of the place that proves the continuity of Vietnamese people during the history. Here, all the buildings and garden remind about the fact that power had always something to be admired. This was that kind of experience for me."
"Incredibly historic and interesting, but a lot of it was destroyed during the American war. Definitely take a guide; they will tell you where things used to be, what they were for, and reconstruction efforts. As of right now though, it is worth a visit but there is not a ton of things to see."
"from some original, some rebuilt and some in a state of decay this is a interesting view of a time more glamorous perhaps...lots of walking required and lot of it in the sun, though also a lot of covered walkways have been rebuilt.... very interesting architecture and worth the effort..."
What a beautifull place. Just wonder around and enjoy. 😊There are still many buildings old and renovated. Bring water and you camera
"We went at night and luckily saw several traditional Vietnamese displays of music, martial arts and dancing. The central part of the citadel is well lit and looks really nice at night. The further out to the edges you go though the less well maintained / refurbished it is. There were very few people there when we visited as most tours take place during the day. Well worth a visit."
"No too many authentic places left around here - so much has been destroyed by bombings during the war. This palace is not much different - it has been almost completely destroyed and now being restored piece by piece. Seems to be influenced by Chinese architecture of the time. I enjoyed visiting this piece of Vietnamese history.
Men and women must take off their hats upon entering the palace building and women are required to wear long pants or skirts - below knee. Having a long scarf that you can tie around your waist is fine though.
Having an umbrella seems to work best to cover from sun. Water can be purchased in multiple gift shops around the palace. Rest rooms are in very good shape.
There is a very nice clean restroom in the theatre building. You have to remove your shoes to enter theatre. They give you house shoes to walk into the bathroom, but Bare feet is also ok - was clean enough."
"From April to 15 September the Citadel is open at night from 7pm to 9.30pm. Apparently its a new venture to get tourists in when the days are scorchers.
If you have been in during the day get a 50% off voucher from the Hien Nhom exit gate as you leave to present when you come back at night.
Some of the buildings are lit up and there are several performances repeated twice each night. Changing of the guard, musicians, fire twirling, orchestra and dance. The dance was totally lost in translation as there was much spoken, but delightful nevertheless.
Not very busy but well worth a visit."
Really impressive and in a great setting. Close to the city centre but apart and tranquil. You can imagine what it would have been like in its glory days
I only stayed in Hue a couple of days but it was impactful enough to know I will return and stay a lot longer. Probably a better city to stay at when in the Da Nang area. Very beautiful city with plenty to see and do and provides easy access to DMZ area for these day tours.
"Great site for both the imperial history of Hue and the destruction of the Vietnam War. Beautiful existing buildings and large open places where buildings had been but we're destroyed by bombing. I probably should've have gotten a guide because the signage is very limited, especially anything more than the name of a building or complex."
"Like a lot of attractions in Vietnam, this was amazing to see and spend time at (with few restrictions in where you can and cannot go) but you should ensure you go here with a tour guide. We did not and as such we found a lot of the experience did not have context required."
"From 7pm you can visit with everything lit up. Entry is around 150,000 dong per person. A tour would be useful if you want historical information, but we just wanted to see the architecture. It was beautiful, and not too busy with people. We listened to a musical performance & roamed the grounds."
tours arranged at the gate of this attraction should be avoided. The state run tour on entry is not thorough and speakers not able to answer questions. This is not helped by the guide or ticket office limited ability to understand English.
"We visited the Imperial city as part of a tour with a very informative guide. The history of the citadel was very interesting, as was learning about the lives of the Emporers who lived here. It is unfortunate that much of the original citadel has been so damaged by war. The rebuilding efforts are commendable. This offers a good insight into life in feudal Vietnam."
The imperial city was an impressive place that the family really enjoyed. Exploring the gardens and carp filled waterways and impressively preserved buildings on a sunny day was hard to beat. It really gives an insight into imperial life many centuries ago. Well worth a visit.
"The citadel is a must when in Hue. The price is 100k vnd, and if you visit after 7pm you have the chance to see some performance like martial arts training, fire show and instruments plays.
It's well maintained although the war destroyed many things."
We were short of time and wanted to know about the citadel so paid for a guide. What a difference she was so knowledgeable and interesting. Our guide gave us information that appealed to all of us including our teenagers which made the whole visit very enjoyable. An incredible place. We will be back to see the renovation work
"Visited in the noon on a very hot day with a 2 year old infant. As such did not walk the whole imperial city as much as i'd wished too, because the little one is getting hot tired and cranky, and we had a tour to catch

but the exterior is so beautiful! a moat surround the citadel which is protected by high walls. before u enter the gate, there is a large flag tower. u get a sense of patriotism even if you're not vietnamese.
as u walk through the gates of the citadel into the imperial city, its like walking into the inperial history of vietnam when they were ruled by the emperor, and getting an insight of their lifes. most of the inner grounds are still under restoration from the war period.

A must visit when in Hue for those into history and seeks to visually understand a cultural piece of vietnamese history!

personally i will visit again and walk the whole ground either on my own or once my kid grows older"
"Wonderful to see, especially now the government is putting money in to restore the whole 200 hectares of the old city. Wonderful sections with stunning ceremonial room where the King ruled, long corridors full of history stunning huge urns intricate work on roofs and gables you can just create and imagine the imperial court in your head."
Beautiful buildings largely quiet at night when lit up. Nice character and well worth visiting the city for a couple of days.
Lit up by beautiful lanterns the citadel not only looked more magical at night time but was easier to explore due to the cooler night air. Performances around the citadel were great 👍
We went on Independence Day so it was super busy but a great place to visit. We decided to go without a guide and there were enough English plaques to inform us about the citadel.
While in Hue you must see this beautiful historic site! The whole complex is massive and full of Vietnam history so you need to reserve at least few good hours to explore the grounds and read all the information. During the visit there was a rehearsal that added an extra visual touch to our trip.
"It si by far the most beautiful place to visit in Hue, it is a large citadel where you can visit almost a part of the sites (some of them where under restructuring), I suggest to take the electric cars available at the entrance because there is a lot to see and walk around. This place is La Mecca for photographers , every site has an interesting angle or view to shoot with a lot of colours and effects ... the temples and the houses are really stunning beautiful"
"I have been prepared to see this. I saw the citadel just just from exterior because I did not have enough time, just an half day for Hue during my staying în Vietnam. That's why, i did it just in the evening time. Huge hystorical area, located exactly on riverside, a lot of official buildings, green areas as well, the site it is very good preserved. Next time I will not miss to visit in The Day Light. From my Point of view, this is the main touristic interest point in the city of Hue."
"Enjoyed walking among the old buildings. Can see the influence that the chinese had in vietnam. Court officials, palace layout, dragons, cauldrons, gardens, walls..its practically a smaller version of the forbidden city in beijing."
"The Citadel takes some time to discover. You enter via the Ngo Mon gate and walk across the Golden Water bridge which leads to the Thai Hoa Palace which has a beautiful court room. However, once you've see the court room, you pretty much saw the palace. The courtyard and the hallways are pretty poor, showing poor reproductions and pictures of palace life and official documents. Real disappointment and can easily be skipped. But don't despair, the Tho Dien Palace and all its structures are actually much nicer than the Thai Hoa palace. The Truong Sanh residence behind the Tho Dien palace is also worthwhile. Count on spending at least 2 hours in the Citadel, taking the time to discover hidden corners."
"Spent about 3 hours wandering around the site in the midday heat, was not a problem as the citadel was beautiful and interesting. Shame about some of the reconstruction work as we couldn't enter some sites. Still well worth the reasonable entrance fee.
Bring water and prices are increased.
Women need to cover shoulders to enter sacred buildings.
You can experience the Citadel easily without a tour."
"Love the wood work in the main rooms. the red halls , the temples and well kept gardens. The Budha that looks like it is talking on a cell phone. great arches with ornaments and last the Pagoda that we saw on our way down to the boats."
"This place is wonderful, all the history of the various kings was very interesting. It is a shame so much of it was destroyed, bu they are slowly rebuilding. Worth a visit. A guide is well worth it as well."
"The grandness of the Vietnamese history becomes evident as soon as you step into the Citadel. Even on a rainy day, it's hard to miss the gorgeous ruins and the accompanying gardens. Strongly recommended to understand the history and culture of Vietnam."
I did one day trip from DaNang to Hue Imperial city. It took approx 2 hrs to reach Hue from DaNang. I liked this place as I like history. Minimum half day is required to explore the palace as its a vast complex. I visited this place with my son so I took open car ride to avoid excessive walking. You can find information board near most of the buildings. Have enough water bottles and protection from sun. I came to know that there is an evening show outside palace but I could not attend it.
"With cobbled paths and beautiful buildings, our guided tour of the 'Forbidden Purple City' was breathtaking (not just from the heat lol). The scale of the buildings built back in this period is amazing. So much history to learn about."
"This was definitely worth seeing. The gardens were stunning, not too many tourist hawkers and the history was fascinating."
"Interesting Architecture, impressive history it gives insides about the last emperors of Vietnam, very nice reading house and entrance gates."
We visited this place with a local guide which is quite good if you want to learn more about the history and the culture of Vietnam. It has many interesting things to see and learn from Vietnam.
"Special. Easy to visit. Better take a guide in order to really understand the place. If alone allow a couple of hours. Very hot in August, imperative to trink copiously!!"
"This place is really nice, the building are impressive and there is also video which tell you the story about it. I recommend to go there at night, where it's very well luminous!"
Great place to visit. Historical place. A must in Hue and Vietnam. Cultural place. Vietnam is incredible
"If you are interested in the history of Vietnamese History you have to see the palace.
Many different buildings and a lot of old photographies, which give a innersight of the ancient life."
"This is for sure the best thing you can see in Hue. It is very big, so count at least half day to visit it. There are three main parts to visit, a tour guide is strongly recommended"
Well worth the fee to visit. Was only a walk away along the river was very pleasant. Did not like getting asked all the time if we wanted a rickshaw or scooter though.
This site is massive and will take a big chunk of time to visit. However all accessible by foot. A must see in hue!
"Wish we had a cooler day to visit. It was so very hot and there is a lot of walking involved. Comfortable shoes and lots of water (and snack bars) a must!

Beautiful piece of history! A+++"
You will need a guide to fully appreciate the history behind this historic site. Some of the buildings are being restored but there is so much of interest there. I would avoid going in the middle of the day as there is lots of walking as the site is quite big and it can get really hot. If you are in Hue you really should visit here. Our guide was amazing.
"Was not impressed. 😬 The theatre was the nicest attraction. Other places were unkept or off limits. 150,000 entrance fee."
Definitely deserves a visit. The Vietnamese are still restoring the old buildings destroyed by US bombing raids during the war.
"Went there with girlfriend and 2 small children (infant and 3 year old) after dark (came around 7 pm) it was a really impressive experience. Everything is illuminated and the Staff puts on different kinds of shows. We wandered the area and Saw guards train with fire-staffs, a Concert and a play. The 3 year old loved it (We sold it AS a Ninjago Castle :)) didnt go home before then closed Down at 10 pm. I cant recommend going there after Dark enough. The temperature is Pleasant and the place is just beautiful. And Yes, most have been Rebuild after the war, but that doesnt take anything away from the overall experience."
"Very nice place to visit in Vietnam.
It looks a bit like the forbidden city of Beijing in much smaller scale, and much less touristy.
We have been disappointed by the official guide we had, who was not so friendly and made a minimum service."
"If you survive the heat you'll have an incredible view of the eras of the tong and Nguyen.

The best area is the meridian entrance."
I've been in 2 forbidden city and this is my favourite. I believe this because this is big but also well maintained. It worth the trip to Hue.
"Seeing the forbidden city is worth a visit - maybe not during noon (too hot) but you can easily get around looking at the fascinating history of this place

Entrance fee is fair priced (150 kD)

Entrance is in south side gate (exit east - just if you arrive with your own scooter). :-)"
It's a must see if you visit Hue. It is an touristic objective with great importance for vietnamese culture and history.
"From the beginning of the 19th century till the Vietnam war, you find all at this place. Full Vietnamese history. You would need a guide to understand everything. A must see in Hue!!"
"We came here with a guide through, getyourguide.com
Very nice and a lot of information can be found here. I would suggest to go early. Temp was really hot when we went. 39 degrees celcius."
When in Hue make sure you go to visit. The Imperial City gives you a glimpse into the lives of those who lived here and how they lived!
"The scale, history and the enormity of this site is astounding. How it has survived wars, suffered the bombings of the 'American War' and still offers so much in its former glory and grandeur. There is much restoration and one can imagine it's former glory. Not to be missed."
"The Citadel is a great example of traditions gone by. A really nice place to visit even in the extreme temperatures. Incredible place that would take hours to see all of. There are numerous documentary exhibits all around the cloisters which offer insights into the dynastic rule. A must visit on a trip to Hue city rightly has been the center of power and control till it was destroyed by the french.
We loved this site."
"We went here on a scorching day with high humidity and for some of our group the steps were a bit of a stretch, but all made it. The end result was worth it though, with some really interesting artifacts and items to see at the top. Well worth the climb and a brief visit.................."
Very amazing to see and there are some posters to read with information. But we really had no clue what we were doing. You need a guide to appreciate better what your seeing. There is water and snacks for sale inside but they are relatively more expensive.
Visited this site in a very hot day. But even that the place is still very interesting. A lots were ruined during wars and under restoration now. Will be beautiful after finishes.
The Citadel was very interesting. Lots of things to see with some impressive buildings. It was very hot so would recommend going as early as you can to try to get around without it being unbearably hot. Would definately use a guide - we had a guide as part of our tour but you could hire a guide at the entrance if you were venturing there by yourselves. It was defintaly worth someone talking through what we were actually seeing rather that trying to work it out.
"The citadel was bombed by the Americans during the north/south war, and some of the original buildings are gone while others are being restored.

A 15m video shows the digital reconstruction of the site and what it was like in the heyday.

There are also lots of black and white photographs taken of court life when it still operated as a palace.

We were also lucky to see the mandarins there in their finery for a video session and the emperor as well.

A must-see in Hue."
There is a lot to see here try and get in as early as possible to avoid the heat! We had our guide with us so hearing all of the history while we were inside was great! As this site has seen war there is a lot that is damaged and you can see bullet holes but they are restoring it.
I came here with my dad in August and we found it such a relaxing and interesting day. The grounds are beautiful and they just kept giving!! The gardens are a must see and the whole complex is well looked after and there are plenty of cafes and toilets dotted around. Leave a full day or afternoon. A must see!!
... only one third of this place is in good condition. Nice place. Awesome scenery and interesting. You can walk around for couple hours for only 150k VND
"historical place to visit, you should buy combo ticket to visit Khai Dinh tomb also (i think this is the best tomb to visit made by ceramics), and only 26th March every year is free here to visit (no ticket) because that day was victory day in past war 1975."
"Great experience but only managed 4 hours because of the heat, even though we arrrived at 8.30 a.m. -would have been better to arrive for earliest entry at 7.30. Avoid the unofficial tour guides who will approach you at the taxi stop off point; there are official guides at the main entrance after you buy your 300Dong entrance ticket. We regretted not actually using a guide, as this would have improved navigation around the very large site, and the knowledge would have enhanced what we're looking at. Used a couple of the drinks vendors for coconut, water and coffee- was surprised at the reasonable prices, given the captive and very thirsty audience!"
"This is a great place to get an idea about the last dynasty to rule Vietnam. Despite or perhaps because of not having actual power the kings spent on building a large citadel and within it palaces and gardens. While many were damaged during the wars, restoration work continues and large parts are open to the public."
"This old castle is a big one, too much thing to see. It's larger than we think, some thing new inside, just built for 2 -3 years, but it's good"
"I went Hue Citadel in 2000 and again in 2017. I expected it to change in the years in intervening and it had.. there are more tourists and some of the buildings have been cleaned up, refinished and some are in progress. None of what had been done seemed like it wasn't what should have been done.

Each time I have gone- I have wanted to see more of it. In 2000 we did it alone with a guide book. This time we had a guide, Thuy from Odyssey Tours. She was great. She stayed with us through Hoi An as well. I highly recommend Odyssey tours- they did our whole Southeast Asia trip and it made it worth it. I would have stayed longer at the citadel and explored it more but the time we spent (nearly two hours) was good with our two teenage boys.
I would go back to this again."
With half a day in Hue we only had an hour but could have easily spent two or three here - there was even plenty of shad from the summer heat in the palaces and other structures. Also recommend the video which shows models of original and story of the building and rebuilding. Like Ai much in Vietnam an international treasure.
"A beautiful set up inside three walls surrounded by a moat. Although part of it was destroyed during the wars, you can really get a feel of the life of the last dynasty. Many buildings are still standing and you can book a buggy to go around as it is an extensive complex.
Unfortunately the throne room was under renovation.
A must visit while in Hue"
"The grounds are large and this time around we didn't have time to see it all (nor could we, as parts were closed for maintenance). The reconstruction film that plays is very helpful for getting a sense of what was once there. Only 40 percent of the buildings remain after the war. There is also a model that helps orientate you to the grounds. The imperial palace gives insight to the Vietnamese monarchy (which is now no more) as well as culture. Worth having a guide but can also wander on your own as there is enough info there to get an idea of the place."
If in Hue this is a must see. Go early. As it gets really hot. Well it was when I was there( August).
"Friends didn't rave about Hue in the same way they spoke about other places in Vietnam, but the citadel made our stay there worth it.
This place is so vast, packed with history, spectacular buildings and surprises around every corner.
The complex is easily one of the most impressive places I've visited.
Stay hydrated as the summer heat is pretty intense."
Lots to see here. We took more than half a day going round imagining the life of the Imperial court. Much of the enclosure is ruined or lost but what remains is worth a visit.
"An interesting sight, like most antiquities in Vietnam there isn't that much to see but it's still worth a visit, quite extensive grounds so take your time and wear comfortable shoes, it was very hot when we were there so go early or late to avoid the heat and the crowds"
"Those who are interested in Historical visit must visit this place.
You can feel the history about this place but must take a guide to visit this place"
"Not overloaded with information but a nice insight and pleasant place to visit.
Hot hot hot so be prepared to take your time and stop at the many drinks places on the way round"
We spent most of an afternoon just wondering around. Lots of old photographs on display from when it was still occupied.
Hue imperial city is worth a visit. It's a beautiful area and it's nice to walk the grounds. Don't be fooled and think you need to book a tour to visit though. If you rent a bike you can visit this and lots of other cultural sights in one day and save yourself a lot of money.
"We visited during the day, and then decided to return enter at night (during the summer it opens at night too).
It was amazing! During the night the citadel comes to life with shows and games!
They had a change of the guards, martial arts show, music, fire show, performance in the theater, old time games, art and more! We kept feeling like we were missing things!

Defently worth it. Would consider entering only at night, it's half price compared to during the day..."
we spent an afternoon walking around the Imperial City: what a pretty sight! Take your time and walk around; you'll discover new old things around every corner!
"A bit boring in my opinion. The most of the buildings are destroyed. Im really interested in history but the Citadel was not very interesting. There was trash everywhere and it was not clear for me where I was walking. It's okay to see, but I'll not recommend it"
"For us the weather was to hot so we rushed the place. We liked it, but it wasn't a spectacular place imo. Nice to see, but nothing special!"
With so many photos and explanations the Citadel is a journey in the imperial times of Vietnam. Absolutely loved it. not cheap but worth it
"Nice place to visit! Impressive and interesting, specially last hour in the afternoon so you can see the sunset there and also stay until 19h when the open performances that take place. Very recommendable!"
"a Great visit - a MUST recommend - Don't miss this one !
Incredible historical sites . . . . . soo many ....
we came privately on a full 1 day trip from Danang ....
however would recommend a guided tour.
This 3 hours drive by itself is already fantastic and you can experience the great
country side and beaches. a an alternative you can use the train... but this will take longer..."
"we visited citadel just yesterday, but we cannot say it's one of the best places to visit!!
it cost a lot for what it offer.. it seems to be decadent..
there are many work in progress, so maybe in the future will be good, but actually the ground is plenty of big holes and it's not comfortable walking in.
we preferred the visit to the tombs!
very nices the gates of citadel and night show"
"I am myself a history teacher in England and my husband is a big fan of old civilizations. We have been visiting every single ruin in South East Asia and the Hue Imperial City definitely is one of place to be for your thrist for knowledge, an old palace with so much incredible values for Vietnamese people! We were lucky to be met up with our Thu from Beebee Travel and had a fruitful visit in the Imperial City. Her English is amazingly perfect and her knowledge is SO impressive. She told us so many interesting stories how 13 Emperors lived and how struggled it was for them when it came to French colonization and later on, the rise of the Communist Party. Our favorite lesson would be the LONGEVITY symbol. We have been seeing that symbol as decoration in many hotels and cafes but truly understood it when Thu explained to us in front of the Supreme Harmony Hall. Such a precious meaning that we would remmember for life! Thu later that night gave us a card that has the explaination for long life which impressed us very much at how passionate and dedicated she is to spread the true value of Hue and Vietnam to travelers. Highly recommend a place for people who love history. Make sure you get a guide to make it more meaningful."
This old city is truly beautiful. A little confusing to get into from the main parts of town but worth the visit.
"A worthy visit - spent a couple of hours wandering around the city, and there were some great coffee shops outside the gates to sit and shade from the midday sun as well. Would definitely recommend on a visit to Hue."
"With only 1 full day in Hue, this was the main focus of our visit there. There were a couple of other places nearby we wanted to check out (museums etc.), but nothing else was opened. I don't know what the rest of Vietnam is like, since this was our first visit and we only stayed in Hue & Hoi An, but there was a certain sense of decay and they are just in the process of putting things back together. Maybe in a few years things will be a bit more set up and operational. The Citadel is probably the most ""put together"" of all the main attractions in the city center. You will definitely want to come here for a sense of the history of the place. It is a UNESCO heritage site. You will want to be prepared for the heat though. Hue is HOT! Sunscreen, hat, umbrella, bottle of water. July 2017 was no joke.

To get your ticket, you have to go to the main entrance. Once you buy your ticket & enter you can't leave & come back in again. You should plan to be inside for a couple of hours to see everything. Either eat before going in or bring snacks in your bag. There is a cafe inside with some refreshments & food. But it's limited."
"We decided to do the Citadel ourselves and walked from our hotel. The size of it was incredible! So much to look at and there is so much information about the history of the place so it's a great way to learn what they all went through. There are some bullet/bomb holes around the walls which really makes you appreciate what they went through with the war as well.
Be sure to bring a sun hat and plenty of water in the summer - it was incredibly hot and the drinks inside are very overpriced. Definitely a must do in Hue."
Fantastic and very interesting. Despite the geat there was plenty of shade and lots of cool stuff to see
"Overall I was a little disappointed initially in the imperial city. At first all I saw was ruins of what once was, with little information of what went on here.

I was very disappointed that they seemed to have just let everything rot, even though they charge an entrance fee of 150,000 dong for tourists. This however is only the case on one side, the other is currently being restored, a little.

It's still not what it could be, it seems to just be a endless amount of buildings now filled with gift shops and restaurants that charge way over the norm.

I would recommend going, just don't have high hopes."
This palace resembles the forbidden city in Beijing. You can enjoy traditional vietnamese style architectures and gardens filled with lotus flower. 150K for admission.
We visited this site on a day trip from Hoi An and had sufficient time to see much of what is on offer but you could spend much longer wandering the grounds. Many people wandered on their own but our group of 6 came with a hired English speaking guide and he made the trip all that more special with is knowledge of the area. You will gain much more from your visit if you have a guide.
"Visited as part if a tour and was blown away by the cultural history, stunning architecture and beautiful scenery"
"We spent a leisurely 5 hours wandering with our guide book. We were able to see the ""must sees"" when they were emptier and found areas such as the Co Ha gardens nearly empty. Enjoyed 2 coffee stops. Then we came back for the night opening which was hardly promoted. A feast of cultural action with few other people. Beautiful lights with dance, music and theatre and a half price entry because we had been during the day. I would highly recommend this."
"This is a really interesting place to visit with a lot of history, there is renovation work going on and the cost of the ticket is put towards that renovation which is great. The renovated buildings are beautiful and really give you an idea of what the place looked like in its former glory. It was definitely a full days visit, but worth it, even in peak season because it is so big it doesn't feel busy."
"This is a great place to visit but take care to enter by the right gate as should you do what we did and try to enter via the exit, a long walk is then needed!

The heat was intense so take full advantage of the inside rooms to cool off but there is plenty to see and well worth the effort."
Well worth a visit. If your enjoy history this is a fascinating place to come. There is still work on reparations as many of the buildings were sadly destroyed through war. It was explained to us that they are rebuilding many of the old building and it goes a long way in understanding Vietnamese mentality of rebuilding everything piece by piece.
"It was a nice palace, but not really impressive or so. I also liked the reconstruction video Korea made. But it was a pity that the show in the theatre is so expensive!! (200k pp)"
"It took me 2-3 hours to go around but couldn't visit every place (it would probably cost me a whole day). Some parts were ruined, some were under reconstruction. Good place to go if you want to learn about Vietnamese history under Nguyen dynasty."
"The place seems a wonder for an adventure of exploring the old ruins - and you are going to have to, because the Vietnamese ticket offices will not be helping you. Maybe they were extra unhelpful the day we visited because of the unbearable heat, but still... lovely place but it for tourist it could be better."
"We found this a bit drab, but we went dueing the day and it was very hot. If going, i recommend foing in the evening"
"This is a large complex so be prepared for a long wander through history.
It is a compound built around the emperor of the time enclosing the purple city (the Royal quarters) within the citadel.
There are areas within areas and you will enjoy slowly wandering through the many varied buildings
This is a UNESCO site so restoration work is ""slowly"" in progress
Entry is roughly €5 which also gives you a ticket to two other sites during your stay
There are glorious long shuttered corridors linking one section to another with black and white photographs of the emperors at the turn of the century.
There is even a tennis court?!? Yup - the last emperor was apparently very handy with a racket
We walked to it from the centre of town but easily got a taxi back
Green taxis are best"
"You need a guide to ensure you get the full history of this amazing place. The history is amazing and very interesting.
We visited in 38 degree heat which was challenging, so make sure you have plenty of water. They have fans and at times a nice breeze.
Even though it was very hot and humid, we enjoyed visiting this attraction very much and learning about the local history and the changed in Vietnam over the centuries."
"In all fairness it was a stinking hot humid day which wasn't great.

The citadel is a really interesting partial ruin with some good artefacts and a reasonably good movie presentation. But there is scant information once you are within the walls. The purple/forbidden city has been destroyed in the French and American wars so you are left with the outer buildings."
"We opted to visit in the evening as the day was simply too hot.
I believe it's only a newish option from 7pm-10pm.
We had a really good time, whilst not all of the citadel is open to wander around it has a good many of the main buildings open to go, and what's more in the evenings there was a changing of the guards, some performances in the courtyard showing traditional dances to the rulers health.
There were also musicians and singers, again showing a representation of events that would've transpired.
As a complex it is interesting and whilst we went unguided there is a guide option, but with a book and reading the signs you understand its importance.
A nice touch is a 3D cad video showing the overview and different zones.
Sadly, as happens from time to time, renovation works taken and in this case the emperors throne was hidden"
This is a property where you should pack a picnic and go spend about 3 hours. We didn't even get to see half of the area. Great history.
"Hue Imperial City, a former capital of Vietnam, is an impressive palace complex inside citadel definitely worth visiting. Huge foreground leads to the entrance to the walled palace complex where you can see beautiful gardens and palace buildings filled with nostalgic history of Vietnamese Empire. When I visited the citadel, a group of young ladies in colorful Ao dai, traditional Vietnamese costume, enhanced the beauty of the palace complex. The citadel is a must see attraction in Hue."
"You can't miss the Citadel, easily Hue City's most important landmark. It's not too challenging to tackle, but here are a few tips from my wife and I's recent trip there a few days ago.

(1) Spend the 1-2 USD to take a cab there. There isn't a whole of cloud cover as you're exploring these ruins, so save your strength (especially during the dry season!) to get there.

(2) If you are in Hue City for more than 1 day, get a combination ticket (Citadel plus either 2 or 3 tombs close by). The Citadel itself is fascinating, but it was interesting to see the tombs as well to get a fuller picture of imperial life in Hue. There are many ways to get to the tombs - take a boat down the river, hire a company for a day tour, or just (as we did) do it the DIY way and have a cab take you to all the tombs outside the city (they are glad to wait for you, won't run the meter while waiting, and hitting both the tombs and the pagoda from the city center ran us just under 18 USD for the whole day).

(3) Hire a local guide. While the ruins speak for themselves, and most important signs are also in English and French, the guides at the Citadel and tombs can give you very helpful summaries of the basic histories of the Nguyen dynasty and the symbolism behind all the structures left.

(4) Make sure to hit the lesser known parts of the compound, like the empress residences in the NW corner, and all the western residences (including the urns). While the Forbidden City itself (into which you empty after going through the main southern gate) is sprawling, don't forget the rest.

(5) If the heat is really killing you, consider springing for the electric car, which can shuttle you between the major sights in the compound. We didn't take it, and we regretted it.

(6) Thankfully, each major spot in the compound has a WC and refreshments stops, ensuring you don't suffer of thirst for too long.

(7) All told, I think you can do the Citadel in about half a day. I'd highly recommend morning over afternoon (less sun, less amounts of large, annoying tourist groups)."
"Enjoyed visit appreciated seeing history but maybe more could be done with it
It was great to tour around and see all the parts but there was no using the culture of it to display in more depth to the unknowing tourist.
With hot weather had to buy additional water so plan ahead"
Trying hard to restore to former glory. The models of the different sections help to get a picture but a lot of work to do.
"I enjoyed this Citadel and Forbidden City very much, even in a hot day. It is built in the similar design and purpose, however being smaller and less crowds it is more intimate. Hue is a city worth visiting as is this Citadel regardless of seeing Forbidden City. You have to spend days to discover it. Interesting place."
"We spent a few hours wandering through the Imperial City and it was very impressive. Absolute must visit in Hue! The site lay out was confusing (even with maps), but getting a bit lost in beautiful old buildings is not a bad thing..."
"When you are coming to Hue, you should probably visit the Imperial City. In fact, it's one of the main sights in town. Compared to other historic sites in South East Asia such as Ayutthaya or Angkor, the Imperial City is a bit disappointing. Still, there are some nice spots to see. I particularly enjoyed the Dien Tho Residence with its lovely pavilion above a lily pond. You can sit down here in the shade and have a cold drink to soothe your dry throat."
"While a lot of work needs to be done to bring this back to life, I enjoyed wandering all the lesser visited sections and using my imagination. Its vast so plan at least a few hours! Also recommend climbing up on the exterior walls for great views."
"We spent half a day wandering around and enjoyed it, much was damaged in the war and a cyclone but they have renovated with care. Recommend the garden (name in the picture) on the east side, no one else there thousands of bonsai and a nice cafe."
This is a massive complex built in the 18th/19th century by the Royal family and was also the site of fierce fighting during the Tet offensive of the Vietnam war so this is of both older and more modern historical interest. The Vietnamese are doing a great job in restoration so you will not be disappointed in what you will see here.
"Amazing ruins from the recent 19th century, and they are being upgraded all the time. In some ways this city is the heart and soul of Vietnam and going there is key to understanding its history and spirit."
"Eat before you go as it's alot of walking, alot of renovations were happening so many buildings were closed off to the public. It is a 'must see' for history but there isn't actually that much to see and not that much history when wanting to go in depth."
It was very hot when we visited this incredible attraction. You can take as little or as long as you like to explore it is huge. There is an area to buy drinks etc. We chose to wander around on our own however there are tours if you prefer. So much to read and to take in. I suggest at the very least two hours but those who like to read all the information could take many many more. 150000 vnd to enter the site. You can get there by taxi or walk.. we got dropped off on our dragon boat 🚣 tour. Go and check it out it's worth your time it's fascinating. History at its best.
"The Imperial City also called the Forbidden City was an amazing place to visit. The architecture was very reminiscent of ancient China. It had amazing pagodas and long corridors was something to see.
While it was very hot the day I visited there was opportunities to relax in the Purple Forbidden City.
There were areas though that needed maintenance as time was taking its toll on the architecture."
"We got here on a really hot day and there isnt much shade, so that did influence our enjoyment. However it is somewhat the only thing really to see in the center of Hue.
Entrace fee is not cheap and well it was okay to see but we really didn't find it special.
Most of it is rebuilt after the war."
"After a couple of weeks in Cambodia and Asia we have started to become a little doubtful that attractions we visited would be as good as the hype but on this occasion we were pleasantly surprised. Entry fee was a reasonable 150,000VND for adults and 30,000 for our son. Other reviews we read had suggested that we should avoid the morning due to bus tours but we decided to go early anyway due to the heat later in the day. Arrived at 8am and ignored the usual flood of touts selling maps, cycle rides and maps and bought our tickets fairly easily. Once inside we enjoyed the delights of almost 3 hours UNinterrupted by someone trying to sell us something - true bliss. There were some large groups but this place is SO vast that they soon dissipate. Not too much signage but lots of photos as you walk along beautiful pagodas and you can just enjoy the beauty of the building - or watching the tour groups take selfies whilst their teenage children sit and check out their Facebook page. Took us a while to find the Co Ha gardens inside but SO worth it. They are beautiful and have the most reasonably priced food (very limited simple menu) and drinks in the complex. We sat and ate for almost half an hour looking out on to topiary gardens and probably only saw about 10 other people during that time. Overall we were amazed how much time had passed and what a pleasant time we had, had."
I visited with my eldest daughter and wife and allowed a whole afternoon as we had been told it would require a good few hours. The buildings that are still standing or have been restored are truly amazing. The site is huge and you need a good 3-4 hours to cover it all. The Queen mothers area is especially beautiful and tranquil. A real shame that it got bombed but that's not taking away from what is still a stunning site.
"Well worth the visit, a definite must see while visiting Hue. I recommend arranging a motor bike tour there and being dropped off. The Hue Imperial City tour will require a guide to understand the full importance of this site and"
We visited this place on a rainy afternoon. Super unfriendly staff but beautifull place. Checking out this part of history is a must for everyone who visits Hué. Not really interactive but go and visit!
"You can actually move from Da Nang city to Hue, through HaVan Pass that is an experience, Hue imperial city is an interesting place with ancient architecture (I think it is downgraded by time) as well. Valuable experience and understanding of the history of Viet Nam, participating in Imperial music Hue is an indispensable thing"
"Hue Imperial city and complex of hue monuments that so beautiful
It's chinese style and so many great!!!
Ticket charge 150 VND"
"I guess the only problem about my tour of this place was that the guide didn't speak very good English. Either that or she got her facts wrong because I was kinda confused. But that aside, I truly enjoyed just taking in the immensity of this place and looking at how heartbreakingly beautiful parts of the palace are in ruins because of the war. Let's not forget that UNESCO listed this as a world heritage site, and now I see why. Definitely worth a visit, and bring a towel if you're here in summer."
"A great tour with tour guide (but best to read up on a little history before). The guide was very helpful and the walk is pleasant and it was not too busy. After the guide says goodbye, go the far rear of the Citadel to escape the crowds and see other older buildings and a beautiful koy pond-very peaceful."
"Just visiting it is overwhelming. But hearing the stories about the emperors lives makes you imagine what placed this must have been. Due to the bombing, not all buildings are left, but overall it gives an excellent expression. Very large complex."
Definitely worth visiting. I'm by no means a history man but it was impressive and the shear scale of the site was amazing. Tip though - bring a hat and lots of water. I didn't and it got HOT with few places to buy refreshments from. You can spend hours here
"First of all, the admission fee for the Citadel is quite expensive, i.e. VND 450,000 (US$20) compared with that to the Forbidden City in Beijing (USD$10). Is it worth for its value? It depends on what you are looking for in Hue.

It was a historic capital of Nguyen dynasty (1802 to 1945), and was built with reference to the Forbidden City. It was thus highly influenced by Chinese culture, including the architectures, costumes, written characters, etc. It does provide an exploration to the Vietnamese history.

As a tourist from a Chinese community, I don't find this Citadel very impressive and worth paying a visit as the Forbidden City is much more magnificent."
Visiting with a 12 year old a historic building is always a challenge. But with our guid and the way he broth history alive even the generation z was impressed. Because of the high temperatures surging noon I recommend to plan the visit early in the morning
It's very hot. It's pretty but we couldn't bare the heat for very long. Easily accessible from city tho and nice walk over bridge.
We visited the Citadel with our private tour guide. She gave a lot of details about the Emperors of Vietnam. The buildings are beautiful. They have a long gallery of photographs which is neat to see too.
Really amazing citadel. Loads to see. I read the reviews and now disagree with a lot of them! I think it's only right locals don't have to pay so much. I didn't think the drinks and snacks were crazily priced. The entrance fees were also fine considering the scale of the refurbishments and how important it is to preserve this amazing citadel! It was cool! Don't be put off- it was a great few hours and my children loved it!
The imperial palace is nice to see. Take your time for a visit and try to visit early in the morning
"Give yourself plenty of time to wander the Citadel. I had 2 hours here, next time I'll spend the day. The grounds are extensive and having a guide who can assist with the history was beneficial."
"The Citadel is a must visit on any day tour of Hue. From the entrance gates to the moat and the extensive grounds, it is well worth a visit. Make sure you visit the beautiful elaborate theatre."
"The Citadel, imperial palace and forbidden city were great to explore on a very hot afternoon. Lots to see - it's smart to have a good guide to get all the scoop"
"Very cultural city and I like it. Maybe because I was born there. The last time I was at the imperial city I went during the day and it was really hot. I didn't enjoy it as much. This time around I went at night. Wow it was beautiful and of course a lot cooler temperature wise. There were shows ever 1/2. It was fun. One advise for those who want to visit. Do it! But remember that you can see and experience the whole city within two days, three at most. I have families there so I stay longer but it can get really boring if you stay too long."
"We visit the imperial city at Hue in July. The area spreads out far and it took us hours to walk through it. They are restoring it piece by piece back to its former glorious state and its quite beautiful. I read a little history of the city both about its imperial past and its war time role before I took the tour so it makes it more interesting.
If you prepare to come, bring hat, water, sunscreen and pair of comfortable shoes."
"A must see in Hue.
This place is very similar to the imperial city in Beijing with a twist of Vietnamese culture. The vegetation contributes to a pleasant visit.
The reconstruction and restoration efforts are commendable."
Interesting look at history. Explored the Imperial City on a cruise ship shore excursion and the guide was helpful in explaining the meaning of the site.
"My children had a chance to know about vietnam history, Nguyen dynasty. Cause of they were born and grew ups in Us. And thiss first time they come vietnam, it's my country."
"Yes, sometimes size is important and this Forbidden City wannabe has scale and bulk to suit the most oppressive Oriental despot of old.

Plenty of big buildings with red and gold decorations. And you can get round most of the site with the basic ticket.

We got the ""economy class"" palace ticket for D150,000 each. Not cheap but what's the point of visiting Hue of you don't see the palace?"
This Citadel was recommended to us as a 1 and a half hour visit. That was not nearly enough time-it is vast and needs at least 3 hours! It is spectacular and worth the visit!
"Awesome place. We went on a rainy day. Wear sandles and take an umbrella and rain coat and enjoy! 150,000 dong to get in. Well worth watching the video in the main part on entry. Don't know if it is worth getting a guide as we took ourselves around and read info on the way. We could then decide where we wanted to go. We covered most of it and ended with the royal gardens which were the highlight. Going on your own you can avoid the crowds and linger or rush through areas. Because it was raining it was much cooler to walk around."
"Great place for a wander. A must see when in Hue, you can easily spend a couple of hours wandering round with a quick break for a milkshake, coffee or to feed the huge fish."
"The best advise we were given - go early in the morning. Firstly it is much cooler and secondly less people.
We hired a golf cart. This is the best way to get around the Citadel as it is a large area. The guides stop where you want them to and also at places of interest."
"This very large complex took us 3 hours to visit and we did not go the museum. If you do not go with a guide at least have a guide book its big with a lot of buildings. Some buildings have been recently renovated, others are under renovation and I assume the rest are on the waiting list. Around the entrance area we found there were a lot of other tourists but the complex is so big once you get out into the complex you can often be visiting alone."
"Considering the damage that has been done to the citadel by numerous wars, you need 3 hours at least to see all the various temples and gates. There are plenty of reminders of the Tet Offensive (bullet holes everywhere) and the restoration work on some of the temples is nothing short of amazing. Well worth the money you pay."
We were impressed to begin with but thought there would be more to see here. After the first initial entrance and throne room there wasn't a lot of info to read just photos of the previous monarchy/dynasties. Ok but we didn't spend longer than 2 hours here.
The palace grounds were interesting to tour. I'd suggest going with a tour guide to learn about the buildings and grounds.
This is a large impressive compound with history through the ages. Loved touring the site and many different architectural features and beautiful grounds.
"We had a great walk round the Citadel. Amazing to see the history, great to see the restoration work, shame it was so badly damaged by war. It was seriously hot so we headed out early which allowed us to also get away from the crowds."
Perhaps it was the scorching heat or the crowds but i was frustrated with the lack of information. I couldn't really work out what was what.
Really interesting to hear all the history behind the emperors but if you don't book a tour you won't get to hear this the site will be a bit boring as it doesn't provide this info on site
"Really interesting collection of royal buildings. It gets really hot in the day, so be prepared for that."
Not as impressive as the Chinese Forbidden city but nevertheless spectacular. Being restored to former glory.
"I enjoyed this Citadel having been to Forbidden City, this is much smaller and easier to visit. It is built in the similar design and purpose, however being small and less crowds it is more intimate. Hue is a city worth visiting as is this Citadel regardless of seeing Forbidden City."
Interesting visit but buildings quite repetitive in decoration etc. Well worth a visit but can be miserable when its hot
"Excellent -Definitley worth a visit. Lots of history well presented. You will need plenty of time to see everything.
Absolutely amazing."
Visited the Citadel while on a small group tour. The entire complex is enormous and full of a rich history of Vietnam. Due to the size and amount of monuments it's worth visiting as part of an organized tour so you don't miss anything important
Really worth a look around the imperial place. The old buildings and how the royal family lived. There is a lot to see and walking around is very easy as it is very flat.
"It is definitely worth a visit, but do not expect too much. Walking around the Imperial City is amazing, but part of it is closed due to construction work."
"Such a great experience. We went at night which was cool. They had fire twirling and fighting displays. It was much cool and less tourists. Personally I wouldn't have been able to do it in the heat of the day. There's so much concrete and no wind it would of been awful, so take plenty of water.

It's quite expensive to get in but amazing to see and well worth it.

L+R"
"I have visited the Citadel many times but for the first time it has been opened at night. The heat is a problem in summer and walking around tombs or the citadel can be unpleasant in the searing heat. Luckily someone has come up with the idea of opening at night, sponsored by Vietnam Airlines. They have also added entertainment. Although night and day are totally different experiences, I loved the visit when it was a bit cooler at night. It is very dark in places but you can avoid those if you choose. You will pick up different sights during the daylight that you will miss at night but having visited in the day a number of times I loved the night sights for something different. I have posted the timetable below."
Very interesting history if you take the time to read the guides. Amazing architecture. Go early in the day to avoid the crowds.
Bring a lot of drinking water and some snack with you if you want to go on foot there. Very large complex with lot of tourists. Remember you can enter and exit only through stated places so plan your way well to avoid extra kilometers looking for exit.
"During summer time (June through August) the Forbidden City has extended opening hours. It still closes for day tours at 17:30, however opens up again at 19:00. This is a must see. The show starts with changing of the guards and continues until 21:00 in several different places of the places. I went there with my wife and three kids and all enjoyed the place and the various shows."
Worth seeing - but quite a lot of walking. Reading room very beautiful. If you go during day you get the light to take pictures but there is entertainment in the evening
"Large and lovely grounds to explore. Would go again, lots of interesting colors and buildings to see!"
"Trip to Hue is not complete without visiting the imperial city.

One of the must do things when visiting Hue. It's amazing how it was built and how much area it covered.

It's not near but walkable from the backpackers area, just make sure to get your sunblock on and also water. Be sure to get there as early as it opens to beat the hoards of tourist buses, I heard that it's less crowded in the afternoon too but I can imagine how hot it will be walking around the compound."
"The Citadel really gives you the picture of Vietnam, a country known for a war trying to rebuild but the signs are still visable!
Walking around you see restored palaces alongside gunshot archways and raised buildings. Well worth a visit even if it's just for a few hours as I had."
"Although we probably would have benefitted from having done a bit more reading up on the history of the Imperial City before we went (as we didn't go for a tour guide), exploring the Imperial City was a really interesting afternoon! The restored temples are really impressive and the grounds are stunning!"
"The Hue Citadel is only 200 years old but manages to blend distinct Vietnamese features with French influences. The complex is vast and not very well signed. So bring a couple of hours and go exploring. For a coffee, head to the park which houses an excellent collection of giant bonsai."
"This is a really beautiful place to spend large part of your day. It stays open quiet late so when all the tour busses have gone and the day begins to cool, the flood lights come on. The larger more important buildings close around 18.00 but the rest stay open. Even at busy time there are part that are hardly any visitors get to. Great value, full of interest and beauty. Important tip, pace yourself it is big and there is a night market nearby if you still have the energy."
"The citadel covers a large area of land so be prepared to walk plenty, however there are the little golf buggies to take you around if you need. Be prepared to take your shoes off and be appropriately dressed! All in all a lovely place with great architecture!"
"Nice visit. We regret not having a tour guide. Cab sirens 1-2 hours here.
Very interesting place to visit, a must when in Hue."
"Do your homework on this place's history as there isn't that much information available to read. It's a super big place to walk around so make sure you have lots of water and tons of sunscreen, hats, covers etc. Well worth visiting."
"Visited today with a local guide.

Wonderfully evocative place but surprisingly not as old as you might expect.

Only 150,000 VND so good value.

Worth having a knowledgeable guide to give context to the information within the citadel"
"Spent an hour here as part of a bigger tour. That is not enough time to fully explore but we went through the main parts of the City in the time we had. It was well presented and guided you with videos with english subtitles. This is a vast complex so if this is your thing take an afternoon (or morning to avoid the heat) to explore properly.

We spent 280,000 VND ($13 US) on a 3 attraction ticket including the Ming Mang Tomb and Khai Dinh Tomb. IF you get the chance to visit the Citadel at night it is lit up and well worth a visit. If you go during the day you can get a half price ticket to return at night."
Absolutely amazing...the scale is hard to fathom and yet this creates a sense of tranquility in the middle of the city. There is lots of walking and it was hot in June- so would suggest an early start. Our children dressed up for a photo too which was a bit of fun and a nice gift to take home. Not to be missed.
The emperor palace and citadel of the Forbidden City was a remarkable experience. It was so exciting to see and read about the city and what it has been through after the war. Beautiful buildings left and an unforgettable visit.
"Rich in history and a wonder for the eyes makes this top very worthwhile, if not staying in Hue it is only around 2 hours by car from Hoi Ann. There is such a diverse range of things to see and enjoy for the history buff."
"Thoroughly enjoyed our tour of the Imperial City. Can just visualise the emperors and their minders going about their day in this city. A good amount of walking, though all flat. Need to be careful of moss on the cobblestone flooring though, very slippery when wet. Lots of reading of the timeline and history of the emperors, though you can still get the feel if you don't wish to read."
We enjoyed seeing the Imperial City however maybe a tour would have made it a better experience. There was plenty to read but I feel like we would have learnt more on a tour as it's generally easier to listen to information than to read it.
"What a day! so very hot.....and lots of walking. This is truly an amazing place to visit....please go early before the sun is at its warmest and not as many people. So much to see with most buildings in magnificent condition considering the age. The grounds are beautifully kept with giant frangipani trees everywhere. The perfume was gorgeous. The area to be walked is quite extensive, so if you have any problems walking long distances, I would suggest you arrange for a 'golf like buggy' to transport you around. If you have the time I would recommend you take a couple of days to really explore the city to it's full extent..really worth the visit.."
"An absolute must visit in Hué - the Imperial City is an outstanding example of restorative work done with impeccable care and attention to bring back to life the most impressive of Vietnam's legacies. The entrance fee of 150,000 VND (approximately $6.50) might seem steep compared to other sights in Vietnam but it's money well spent and put to very good use, with restorative work continuing at a steady, dedicated pace. Each building within the complex is incredibly beautiful, and short films with English subtitles as well as miniature city models do an excellent job of explaining the history of the place. Every plaque and description has text in both English and French, and in Vietnamese of course, making this one of the most informative sights of the city, if not the country. I highly recommend the Imperial City even if that's the only thing you do in Hué."
"Well worth a visit, I'd recommend at night, it's cooler and beautifully lit.

We spent at least 90 minutes exploring the different rooms and studying the photos."
"I have visited the Royal citadel many times, I love this place, slowly walking to enjoy the atmosphere
Huế is the last capital of Vietnam feudal dynasty so the Royal citadel is the essence of Vietnam architecture.
But The most interesting activity here is sitting on the wall of citadel at Tu Phương Vo Su cafeteria to watch people and image about 200 years ago."
"It is most beautiful and very quiet there. Incredible hot on mite day even though we took the golf car in the heat.
You definitely have to see, but I recommend you go there in the morning. They open up at 7 am.
Enjoy 😊"
"If you like things lit up by later, do the 7:30 show. I'd probably go in daylight if I could do it again.

Beautiful grounds, but you don't get the same breathtaking awe of going to a pyramid. It's just very pretty, but so is a lake on a summer day.

The performance pieces were okay, but again, nothing special.

Great to do for an hour or two if you're in Hue, but I wouldn't be in tears if I missed it."
"A must-visit tourist attraction in Hue with the deep-rooted historical and spell-binding day and night views of the palace buildings and grounds within the Citadel.

The Hue Imperial City is a walled palace within the citadel of the city of Hue, the former Imperial Capital of Vietnam.

Best to book the Hue City Tour with the ever-friendly and English-speaking lady-riders (on motorbike) cum guides from ilovehuetour ."
I would definitely recommend visiting at night. It was beautifully lit up and a lot cooler and with far fewer people. We saw a few traditional vietnamese performances too.
Yes there must be lots of history here but not much to see - unless you're interested in old photos and photos of old documents
We enjoyed The Citadel by night. Not only did we escape the punishing heat but under lights it was absolutely beautiful. If you're visiting in the summer months I highly recommend a night visit.
"The structures are from the last couple of hundred years. This is no Siem Reap but still interesting recent history. This history of the Nguyen dynasty of a couple of hundred years before the French took over.Not much about war history but this was also the scene of the largest battles of the Tet offensive in 1968. The complex is huge and exhausting on a hot day. There is a cafe not far from front entrance for a cool drink. Can easily,spend,a few hours covering the area."
"Entrance fees is VD150000/pax. Need to spend about 2-3 hours in there as the place is huge. Will appreciate the history better when you also visit some of the Tombs such as Minh Mang, Tu Duc and Khai Dinh Tomb. Renovation still on-going....guess this will continue for manny more years. But theres already plenty to see."
"The Imperial City is an impressive illustration of the opulent lifestyle of 19th century royalty. The architecture is elaborate and the furnishings are beautiful. The royal theater is especially lovely. Part of the space is devoted to an interesting museum. In a few spots you can find signage that explains what you are looking at, but it is hit-or-miss. I recommend investing in a guide book to get the most out of your visit."
"Personally, this was the most beautiful temple and complex I've seen in Vietnam coming from the north. It is really wide and the condition of the first buildings are excellent. We entered around 11:00 and on most pictures there are no people giving a beautiful full of the area and the buildings.

The colors are in tact and there is much detail in all building elements.

Don't go to the pavilion for drinks or food in the south. Really bad service and expensive. Rest of the citadel complex can be highly recommended!"
"I have to say I didn't expect so much beauty 😉
First, I didn't really like the city at all, too noisy and you cannot walk one meter without someone trying to sell you something, which is really annoying.
But when you enter the Citadel, waow!!!
Try to get there soon in the morning because of the heat. There are toilets and places to eat and drink.
It really worthes to spend a day in Hue just for this. I did the whole tour walking and it took me 3 hours.
Don't miss the Co Ha Gardens, they are just the best part of it.
You can also do the tour with electric vehicles if you cannot walk that much."
We had a private tour guide who had a lot of information to share. we hired the buggy to travel around the site as it is quite large and we didn't have a lot of time.
"Went to this attraction as part or a tour we organised ourselves and even though it was over 100 degrees it was very interesting.
In some places you can see bullet holes in the walls from the war.
Beautiful old buildings just oozing the history of hundreds of years. Loved it."
"Impressing area and our good guide gave a lot of good history.... but went mad/agressive when we mentioned that the french Vaubin had been involved in design of the citadel/outer wall.....he taught us it was build only by vietnamese....
Very interesting place"
"Impressive and interesting. Also be sure to visit during the night when there is fire show.
Ticket price a bit steep"
"Good destination for finding out Vietnam history. We recommend this for my family and friends. It make me proud of our country - Vietnam. We really like this trip in Hue city at hotel, restaurant and destinations as well. See you on next time for coming back."
"It was really nice to see how the city once was. Parking for motorbikes isn't clear but you can ask the security. We paid 10,000. Entrance is 150,000 which we thought was pretty expensive. Once inside be prepared to be walking around for a couple of hours - you will get some nice pictures. Worth a visit if you are in to culture and history."
"Was impressed by the look of the palace. Was quite well preserved. We went there upon arrival on the same day and by the time we start exploring the place , the weather was extremely hot.

Overall is worth going to the historical palace where you will see the palace in those ancient time and what transpired in between the era."
"We visited Hue during a very hot May and decided to visit the Imperial City at night, it was very pleasant temperature, there was not many people, beside a few small groups, we had the place to ourselves.The Imperial City looked magical and had various groups performing eg: changing of the guards and groups of dancers. We found it easy to navigate around though only negatives were dim lighting on some exhibits and some uneven ground (not lit) between some buildings. Reasonable cost 150K. I was with friends aged between 45 - 75yrs of age."
"Hue is hot and the Imperial City is even hotter. Not a lot of shade unless you duck into one of the few renovated buildings. Just sad to think that it stood almost intact into the 1960-70's until the bombings of the French and American war pretty much destroyed it. The approach to it is quite impressive entering through the main gate and walking in into the throne room. Stop on the left and view the well-made film of the reconstruction of the city. Before continuing. Otherwise wander around the place across lots of rubble and pop in and out of partially rebuilt structures. There is one place to buy overpriced refreshments and a gift shop. The heat eventually drives you out. However, you can only enter on one side and exit on the opposite, so if you left a bike or motorcycle it's a bit of a walk back to either."
"Try and get here early ( opens at 7 I think) to avoid crowds and the heat!
We spent about 3 hours wandering around the place and found it quite interesting. Used our book for info rather than a guide - this is just one of many temples / palaces around Asia we are visiting so we only want a little info on each otherwise I think we'd drown in it.
You can buy a combo ticket for 360.000vnd and this gives you entrance to the 3 Tombs if you choose to do that tour on another day (and I would recommend them!). The combo gives you a 90000 discount individual entries."
"We enjoyed spending most of a day at this incredible historic treasure. Much of it has been preserved or restored, so you will see several complete buildings, each uniquely purposed -- all of it impressive and worth exploring. You will be able to discover and learn while basking in the detailed enormity of it all. Go with good walking shoes, water and the guide map, and try to see all of it if you can. There is a performance in one spot but you need to get there early to buy an extra ticket and there has to be sufficient people as an audience for them to perform. Your entrance to the place can be combined with two or more other historic sites, we chose two others and it was just great to see everything over 2 days."
Beautiful series of palace buildings in the usual nested/ walled citadel style of this part of the world. Really well preserved and restored. Fabulous grounds to stroll around although it was a hot and humid day so recommend leaving time at the end for a quick sit in the shade with a cold drink
"Very impressive edifice in the center of Hue. Lots of history. View of the citadel is grand and we get a glimpse of the history behind. The weather is too hot, will be good to visit in the cooler month. Buildings and grounds are beautifully. There are many photos taking opportunities. All information is available in Vietnamese and English"
I toured only the outside of the Citadel as part of my recent Hue by Night tour. We arrived just as a reenactment of guard changing was taking place at the front gates. Under the cover of darkness and lit up by various lights both the reenactment and the Citadel itself looked spectacular. The Citadel occupies an important part of Vietnam history and is worth seeing when in Hue.
Friendlier and more interesting than Beijing's Forbidden City. Allow yourself plenty of time. You'll want to sit and rest in the shade between areas of the complex. I carried an umbrella to shield me from the sun.
"There is so much to see here. Best thing I've seen in Vietnam so far.

We spent around 5 hours.
So beautiful."
"Amazing historic place. The assortment of buildings and various homes within... It is overwhelming.
Recommend motobike to tour citadel. Lots of walking if not, though can be done. Plan a day here and maybe return. Hue has tons of history and culture to absorb.
Awesome"
"Make sure you leave a few hours for this huge citadel! Beautiful buildings and lots of signs to tell you what's going on, with places to buy food/drink inside. Worth a visit."
"I enjoyed walking through the huge citadel complex. So much to see. There is a mix of ruins, restoration and original structure and is a fascinating look at life in the old city. Set aside 1-2 hours. Time goes quickly as there is a lot to look at."
"We had a chance to visit Hue in a special day when all of the people do some ritual, praying for something, after asking the local and they said that that the day of the defeat of the palace, we then decided to visit the place.

Mighty with full of historical stories, the place itself is crowded at night when all local and foreigner come to visit. Overall we have a good time.

You should definitely visit this place once in Hue"
The imperial citadel is of impressive proportions and the buildings have been well restored. Unfortunately the gardens have not had the same treatment and their are more gift shops than things to look at within the buildings.
"Nice place for a walk. It's a must see when you are in Hue...but not the most amazing attraction.

Good place to people watch."
"Even on a hot day, you'll forget the heat as you see the ancient arches in the citadel. Amazing to stroll through, even better with a local guide. For Westerners, it's just incredible how old these structures are and how intricate the details. Take your time to explore."
An centuries old Old Royal Imperial Palace strongly influenced previously by the Chinese imperial dynasty. Huge and masssive. Good to visit and spend some time
"We enjoyed a tour of this citadel but we chose a very hot day - 37-40C!

We travelled on a dragon boat from Hue central to visit the citadel and this was a great way to start the tour of this historic place

The place of Hue and this citadel in the history of Vietnam makes a visit essential if you want to better understand this wonderful country"
"This place is huge and you will be doing a lot of walking so come prepare, sunscreen, hat and plenty of water. Good way to get your excercise done for the day."
"This is unplanned trip. After breakfast, decided to take taxi from Da Nang to Hue and cost us VND 2,000,000 for round trip but I felt worth of paying and quite reasonable price.
We visited Hue Emperial City and personally, good for kids."
"Second visit - amazingly
Impressive but he destruction of
The royal residence and temple made
Me
Reflect on the senseless
Nature of vietnams history on being annexed and
Colonised -
The fight between north and
South is centuries old ... a beatific venue of a scale

"This is an impressive citadel which gives you a feel of the old Vietnam. However, be aware that it is quite a walk from the town and is very large when you arrive, so it was challenging to see in the heat. It was also poorly signposted so take a map/guide. Probably worth seeing if interested in Vietnamese architecture but otherwise probably wouldn't go back!"
"Much of this attraction is found outside - and it sounds a tad patronising but bring a rain coat.

Both we and a big group of tourists were semi stranded in the main building for an hour as we did not bring raincoats to explore the majority of the grounds (we soon found out that you can buy rain ponchos inside for around 20,000 each)

Overall the citadel is worth visiting but is certainly overpriced even at £5. Lots of old buildings and souvenir shops which spoil the interiors but it's a cultural must nevertheless. (Photos are banned inside the main palace building)"
"This reminded us much of the Forbidden City in China, although nowhere near as big, nor in such good condition and thankfully nowhere near the crowds.

It is clear that this has suffered the endless conflicts seen in this area but slowly, Piece by piece it is being put back together and will, in time be an amazing place once again. That is not to say that it isn't already as there are lots of the buildings still in excellent repair and available for viewing.

The day we were there it was very hot, but it didn't stop us from looking at most of the area.

Highly recommended for a visit"
"Take the trouble to hire a guide or go on a well organised tour. there are many points of interest in this complex of buildings and temples, so it pays to do a bit of research before you visit."
"This experience is a must in Hue. Despite traipsing through here in the peak of summer the exhaustion was worth it. The video near the start is worth watching to gain context of this landmark.

Visually this is incredibly impressive. We also took part in the dressing up and photos, which we wouldn't typically do. But if you're with the right people (friends ready for a LOL) this is a great activity."
"Nice place. Remembers on times where Hue was the CAPITEL OF VIETNAM. Remembers also the american war.
You need much time for visiting it.
Take a cyclo its more easy
Mr Hue and Mr.Hoa our cyclo divers are fantastic. They are near citadelle on highland Café. Ask for him. 😃"
If you like Vietnamese palaces this will probably be a pleasant visit. It was a very long walk through the park and between buildings that had pretty little to show for.
"We drove to Hue from Da Nang and back in a day so our time was limited. The drive there was ok, but not spectacular especially as you moved further from the coastline. The cost of entry to the palace is a bit steep, but I think I'm happy to pay it for the preservation of the place, but having said that always at the back of my mind was how much of this is original, for so much of it is reconstruction. The place is well set out and the artifacts nicely displayed with both English and Vietnamese information"
"Tip: be ready coz you will have to walk quite A LOT under the heat. Bring yourself a hat/ bottle of water, sunglasses... Or better visit there early in the day or later afternoon."
"Small 5 minute performances in full costume showing changing of the guard ! other types of ancient ceremonial performances.
Again all in costume.. Costs minimal amount.. Well worth visiting twice. IN day and in night.. Kinda sad some of the palaces were destroyed in 1968 during the battles between the NVA and the Americans. This is history!"
The Citadel is a sight to behold! I had never imagined that it would be so big! We had our guide book which had a good map that showed the main areas to visit however I would probably recommend taking a guided tour if you have limited time as you could spend hours there! There are beautiful gardens and the architecture is beautiful. I would get a taxi if you are staying further out as there is a lot of walking involved. A must see and top of the list of things to do in Hue!
"It's a very huge area. You can see a lot of temple and can walk 6 km in it. But that's all, no much activities. The price (200.000 dong) is very high in my opinion."
"Great day out, culturally very interesting we did it without a guide information boards where very informative along with lonely planet guide book.

Excellent place to soak up history about the Vietnamese royal family and associated traditions. It was also interesting to see some of the restoration work going on since the Tsunami and the destruction caused during the Tet offensive

Strongly advise to take large bottle of water and liberally apply sunscreen as the is limited shade in certain areas"
The citadel has some interesting history. The buildings are really beautiful. I walked around during the middle of a hot sunny day and had to take a few breaks in the shade. The large open spaces don't means you get a lot of sun while exploring but it's easy enough to find shady spots.
"After 1945 Vietnam was not longer having royal family so this is a unique place for you to learn about the life of kings, queens, princes and princesses.
This is fantastic attraction but I personally think it can be better with a better care from management team."
"As you walk in the main entrance, you are met with a very impressive building, but that's only the start.
The place is immense, iconic buildings/structures repeated again and again which are a delight to the scenses.
We had an Ice coffee in a quiet corner of the complex, surrounded by a lake and historic gardens, it was one of the best ever tried.
If you travel to Hue, it would be a crime to miss this attraction."
"I had some image in my mind of what ""the Citadel"" would be like. After spending a long morning (4 hrs) of walking that image is completely gone.

The Imperial City is much large than I imagined. The layout is intriguing with long stretches of open space and walkways connecting pavilions with gardens and ponds. Their are plenty of spots of immense quiet and beauty to balance out the crowds of tourists and Audio-visual presentations. Plenty of photos and representations of life while the royal family was in residence. Lots of restoration work going so you can see the high quality of work being done here.

Too many interesting spots to mention. If you are interested in gardens, architecture, art, city planning or Vietnamese culture you will find something here of interest. We plan on spending another day here to see the pavilions missed on the first visit."
"Very much worth visiting whilst in Hue to learn about the history of the Vietnamese Monarchy. Some of the citadel is still in ruins, after damage from the war. However, other parts are already refurbished back to their original glory. We enjoyed reading the large information signs along the outside corridors, very interesting and educational. It was worth visiting this attraction, it is a short walk from where the main hotels are located in Hue."
"The Imperial city was mostly destroyed during that nasty event that is best forgotten, but they are trying hard to restore what they can. Due to its size, you can wander around and not feel overwhelmed by people and heat. Despite the presence of more tangibly pretty internal structures, it is still worth visiting for what you CAN see."
"To be fair, 150.000 DONG was not worth the money. There's not lots of explanations so you don't know what it in that you're looking at."
A beatiful place of immense size it's hard to picture how it would have been before being bombarded relentlessly during the Vietnam war. Nevertheless the restoration done so far and ongoing makes this an unmissable venue when visiting this country.
It has lovely grounds very big unfortunately they did not give us a map which would have been helpful. Visit in afternoon when it cools down as lots of walking.
"We took a cyclo ride from our hotel to the Palace. So impressive as you ride up. The displays of the Kings and their families is extremely interesting. The video presentation is must, gives you an overview of the whole Palace. Lots of walking as there are 23 acres to cover. Allow at least 3 hours see most of the buildings."
"My friends and I waited until the afternoon to visit hoping it could cool down after lunch. It was still way too hot and big to walk around. We had no idea how big the imperial city is, I would 100% recommend the cyclo's! It was so much fun & definitely saved us from the sun! They took us to places we definitely wouldn't have seen had we walked. & we only paid 100VND an hour. Very beautiful buildings! A must see if you're going to Hue"
"We decided to try and do the Imperial City by ourselves, not too sure what to expect. When we arrived at the entrance we realised it was much bigger than we thought! It's an actual city with people living inside. We eventually decided to go by cyclos as it was too hot to walk that far. We agreed on a price of 100,000 Dong for 1 hour, and the tour ended up taking 2 hours. (Not a problem though- we were enjoying it!). The guys took us for a ride around some of the pagodas & lakes and stopped for us to take photos when we wanted. It was a really fun way to do it. They then dropped us off at the entrance to the Citadel, which we did by ourselves. There's no entrance fee to any part unless you want to go inside the actual Citadel. Great day & a good way to do it in the stinking heat!"
"I am updating my review because I my impression changed up-side-down when I spent more time for this place in the last trip. This time, I visited it with my mother who cannot go quickly as others. Therefore, we spent the whole day exploring Purple Forbidden City within the Imperial City. Not only been going straight through, we visited all the courts, temples, gardens and pavilions. Seeing and reading can give us quite a good imagination about the life of royal family in the past. We looked closely to the decoration patterns, the artworks and architecture. They are amazing and it's lucky that we're still keeping all of them."
"This place is seriously interesting. The price to get in at night (7pm-10pm) is 150. It closes from 5-7, something we didn't know FYI.
We got a tour guide at the front gate for 150k. She was good and told us some really interesting stories as she guided us around but then she started rushing us to the show that was starting and left. The performance was in Vietnamese so we did not understand what was happening at all. Usually they will give you a piece of paper translated so you can follow at other similar places but in this case, there was nothing so we had a hard time decoding it. It would have been great if our guide would have hung around to tell us what was going on- I would negotiate that if I ever went back. After the show, we tried to look around but the grounds were pretty dark so it was really hard to find our way around. Then certain areas started getting blocked off and this was 830-9pm, so it was not closing time. We finally found the entry we came in and it was closed. They told us we needed to find another exit so that was interesting, roaming around in the dark to try to find this haha... eventually we did find the way out but regretted not going to see this place in the day as I am sure it would be a much better experience."
Some very nice buildings and temples to check out. Also a few nice gardens you can check out ad well. Bring water and get ready to walk lots.
"This was the place where the last royal Vietnamese family stayed. Despite the destruction caused in the war, it's strangely beautiful to us.They are restoring this citadel so I hope it will be more beautiful next time we are back."
"this is a must visit place in Hue, the imperial city ancient capital. very historical and a lot of interesting facts and displays to see on the royal dynasty and wars."
"We loved this beautiful, ancient, history set of tombs, palaces, and places of worship. The intricacy and craftsmanship inside and outside was a wonder to behold, and it has a tranquil, thoughtful air that beget the hordes of Korean tourists who crowd the first spaces. I would highly recommend taking a local guide who speaks good English ($20) as there is not much information signposted in English."
There were many buildings and courtyards throughout the Imperial city but there were trees and flowers everywhere. A lot of walking and it was extremely hot and humid.
"Visited both during the day and at night. Bought a combined ticket for the tombs for 280,000VND and with the ticket you get 50% discount for the night entry which was 75,000VND.

The grounds are big, there is a mot of walking so bring water and a hat for the day heat and sun."
"A huge complex with a lot of buildings. Entrance fee is a bit steep at 150k without guide. Guide is recommended if you wanna know what you are looking at, since there are very few signs which explains in English."
"The citadel is the most visited site in Hue. It's a reminder of grand times when Hue was the capital of the Kingdom of Vietnam. While it is mainly a tourist attraction now, a knowing visitor can appreciate and marvel about its place in history. The citadel is a smaller model of the Forbidden City in Beijing, tracing Vietnam's close ties with China, and vice versa. One is reminded of just how complex and diverse Vietnam's cultural history is."
"Of historical significance. Covers a very large area so do not suggest you walk in a very hot day but use the transport available.

Generally flat and attractive areas where you can relax for a while. We went there on a warm but humid day, on a hotter day I imagine it would be quite a challenge for older people walking round it."
"The history of Hue is interesting worth a visit to understand it better, can see more than enough from the outside"
"Be prepared for a lot of walking, but it was a great experience. We had a tour guide with us which was great."
"This city was the centre of a major conflict during the Tet Offensive of the Vietnam War. The history of Hue itself is fascinating. The old facades are reminiscent of The Forbidden City in Beijing because the architect in China was Vietnamese. Emperors and Kings ruled from here for hundreds of years, even after the French colonised the country. Get a guide to share all that this wonderful city has to offer.
BTW - Ice used for cold drinks is safe as the govt. subsidises it."
A complex that reflected a complex society. An opportunity to appreciate the apex of societal living a couple of hundred years ago. Real shame what recent wars can do to a cultural icon. Worth going to - there is still more than enough to appreciate...particularly where the Mother of the King lived.
We had a wonderful guide named Van who made this tour very interesting for us. It was also a very pretty and tranquil place to visit
"The whole city is undergoing referbishment after damage during tet 1968 and a storm destroyed lots of buildings. Whilst rebuilding still a amazing place but rebuilding is not as good as should be for a unesco site ...sorry. but true all traces to tet incident is being covered up even the famous gate which showed stuggle of both side is cleaned and covered.
Above aside the place is defo worth a visit would have been amazing palace something for the vietnam people to be proud of. Take a guide .although everything has english transcript the story behind not written means more"
Allow at least half a day to explore this great piece of history. This is why you visit Hue. Very interesting.
"Cool complex and lots to see over a pretty large area. We skipped the guided tour and just went on our own, which seemed fine for us. I'm sure that did it a bit of a disservice but sometimes you want a quicker outing. Lots of cool photo ops around every corner."
Amazing place to see and learn so much about the history of the Nguyen Dynasty and all it's Emporers. A must see!! Quoc Ho was an informative and helpful tour guide with lots of knowledge
"Don't believe any forums that say it's 33,000vnd - it's now 150,000vnd to enter the Citadel. We walked around it for about 2.5 hours and covered about 7km. Nice to see if you have time but it's quite run down in places with renovation work ongoing. Perhaps if you went as part of a tour group - you would get more out of this??!!"
"The Citadel is a huuuge city. We were happy to have a guide to get some details about all those buildings, otherwise, you don't understand so much of the dynamic of the old city. Unfortunately, we had the impression to run a little bit: the site is so big that you could easily spend a whole day visiting all the sections, which obviously, we didn't do with a guide. Plan at least 2-3h to visit."
"The buildings that are still standing are very impressive and it is a massive site.
A good few hours could be spent here. They have toilets and refreshment stalls dotted about the whole site.
You need a guide as there are not a lot of info boards around and it is easy to miss whole sections. The flooring is uneven and there are steps so sensible footwear! I watched a woman in high heels almost break her ankle on the gravel."
"At the moment they are opening the imperial city of an evening and they advertise that if you come back the same evening it is half price for the evening session. However no information on how it works. It turns out you have to get the guy at the exit to stamp a card for you but he wasn't cooperative until some people from a nearby craft market convinced him to do it.
This place is huge. You could spend days in here, but I wouldn't want to. We trudged around the place for hours in the heat and didn't get everywhere.
In the evening there was supposed to be entertainment. A lot of it was either all at the same time or called off. Some ladies played some traditional music for us and then there was dancing in the back corner of the citadel. We then had Ronald a mad dash through the darkened citadel to get to the exit gate before it closed at 10pm, because I sure didn't want to spend a night in there.
If in Hue I would go, but I wouldn't plan my trip around it."
"This is a really impressive UNESCO World Heritage Site near the Perfume River in Hue and dates from the time of the monarchy. It is a massive site and it can be tiring, so take it slowly and take plenty of water and a hat. There is a Korean made video using computer imagery which is worth watching, and it is probably too much to see it all in one day with very young children. The areas on display are well presented, as are the cannon near the entrance. A good way to spend a couple of hours to learn more about the monarchy."
"This is a sprawling complex where emperors of old resided. Despite much damage being inflicted during the French skirmishes in 1947 and during the Vietnam war, this site is still worth visiting."
"My wife and I visited the place in a terribly hot day in April.

The place is very interesting, even if most of the buildings are being rebuilt/restored
Years of wars and a difficult climate took a hard tool on the place.

There is a lot to read and to visit, the imperial City is quite large. Be sure to have a good hat and a lot of water, because the heat can be terrible."
Walking tour but many things to see in the big compound. Can also rent buggies to go around inside the compound about 10-15 minutes but buggies did not stop even for the photo shoot. Shady and nice place to visit.
"My bf and I were really excited to visit the citadel but we're sadly completely unimpressed it.

At first the guard wasn't going to let me in because I wasn't covered up properly but after I saw he let another girl in, dressed the same as me, I had to argue my point with him. He eventually let me in.

There are some nice buildings around and a video on the history which was helpful to watch. The grounds were all in all a bit boring and not looked after at all; Some where construction sights. The most interesting part for us was visiting the theatre.

The whole experience was ridiculously overpriced at 150,000 dong per person."
Increfible to see this place and know the history behind it. Such a shame so much was destroyed in the war. The Chinese influence is striking. Definitely worth seeing.
"Very Interesting, Really Big and a lot of interesting history, great if you feel like a wander or want to discover more details about huē specifically"
"Incredible site. Spend 2 - 3 hours. Get a guide at the entry. The Citadel is so well preserved, it's incredibly interesting to see how Vietnamese royalty lived. Definitely worth your time. Highly recommended."
"Very interesting, great place to learn about Vietnamese culture.
Restorations are amazing, such detail being input."
"Instead of joining a city tour which bundles the Citadel together with the tombs, it should be done on its own. It is a smaller version of Beijing's Forbidden Palace, built in the Nguyen dynasty of 18th century. Much of it was destroyed by wars. Evidence can be seen as I walked around. I spent 3 hours there. Interesting find: go to the Museum of Royal Antiquities after you exit. There you will find the only air conditioned exhibit on Cham Kingdom in the whole museum complex. Also, a small collection of States from that period."
"If you happen to be in Hue this is a must see attraction. It took us about 5 hours to explore around. You need to buy a ticket (150.000 VND)
We walked around on foot but if you are short on time you can get around quicker in one of the electric car tours.
The whole complex has many different areas and the buildings are beautiful. They also have a video show in the place named Palace of Supreme Harmony that shows the history of the place."
"A huge complex that housed the courts, shrines and palaces of the Emperors' of the Nguyen Dynasty 1802-1945. As Vietnam has undergone 2 wars which partially destroyed some buildings within the Imperial City... the whole place has a load of restoration to be done. Entrance fee of VND150,000 for foreigners and VND120,000 for locals... goes toward helping in the restoration of this vast complex. One can just breeze through this attraction in just 30-40 minutes or can spent whole day exploring the many exhibits. Accorded UNESCO World Heritage Status... it is an attraction not to be missed."
"The Imperial City/Citadel was built in the 19th century. It is a combination of Beijing's Forbidden City and a European fortress. It has palaces, temples, moats, lakes, ramparts, gates and bridges. There is something for everyone.

The city covers six square miles and occupies land previously owned by eight villages. This is a sufficient area to house the emperor, his family, courtiers, bodyguards and servants.

Interesting exhibits are the nine bronze cannons cast from metal seized from revolutionaries in 1803. They have barrels five metres in length. On each cannon is carved its name, rank and firing instructions. An interesting afternoon visit."
"We explored the Citadel in one morning (2/3 hours maximum). The complex and buildings were beautiful and there weren't many people when we were there which made the place feel very peaceful. We felt that a nice morning walk before lunch was sufficient time to explore this place. We bought the combo ticket from the Citadel entrance (around 280,000 dong) which gave us entry into the Citadel itself (central Hue) and the 2 main tombs on the outskirts of town (Minh Mang and Khai Dinh). We rented a private car from a street side travel agent to get to the 2 tombs. For 350,000 dong we had a modern, air conditioned SUV and a friendly driver with great English who waited outside each tomb until we were done visiting each site (3 hours in total to cover both tombs and the ride there and back). The tombs are worth visiting and the combo ticket seemed like the most cost-effective option. Hoteliers may argue you need longer at each tomb but we disagree, they can be visited as quickly or as slowly as you like. Cars arranged through a hotel may be more expensive too. We found a travel agent around the corner from our hotel who gave us the same private car deal as the hotel but for $5 less."
"We did this as part of a private day tour, well worth the visit as the 2 hours spent walking around inside the citadel was enjoyable & gave a good insight into it's imperial history, it was a hot day so appreciated having plenty of water & hat/umbrella."
"A great tourist spot to be seen in hue. Easy walking, interesting history, great architecture all hidden away in the heat of hue. Buy the four pass ticket - cost saving and with a trip to the tombs as well. A good way to spend a couple of hours researching the recent history of the royal family of Vietnam."
"To fully appreciate, you need to read in advance about ancient Vietnamese history or have a good tour guide to lead you through the Citadel. You can take many wonderful photos here, but if you are not provided background information, this visit will be lacking. The lives of former emperors were interesting, especially their customs related to their many concubines (“it’s good to be the king!”). It is a very large area, so it is easy to get lost. Try to avoid mid-afternoon, as it gets very hot in the open air. Some areas have been destroyed by bombing during the war with the U.S. and fierce fighting took place here during the “Tet offensive”. Much of the area is in the process of being restored. This site is a must see when visiting Vietnam. Just be prepared to do a lot of walking."
"The historial seat of government in a finally unified Vietnam (late 18th century) Hue is worth a visit. It's not a grand or as old as other places you might visit in SE Asia (e.g., Angkor in Cambodia or Ayutthaya in Thailand) but given its historical significance it's well worth a visit. Just prepare yourself for incredible heat during the hotter times of the year."
"payed 150,000 vnd after we parked our bikes at the entrance. walked through the enormous kind of interesting palace(much better sights in the city for culture) and then noticed that all the locals were just going through back entrances for free. we don't know why we payed. at the end of experience we went to leave and we're told quite rudely that we had to walk all the way around the citadel to leave , nobody told us this when we parked our bikes at the entrance. terrible experience"
One doesn't understand Vietnam until visiting the Hue Imperial City to realize how deep and long the history of Vietnam has been.
"I felt compelled in my visit to Hue to visit the Citadel. Vietnamese are very proud of their history. The 18th century building did not excite me, however they do have great footage you can sit and watch for about 10 minutes once inside the walls, recommend you do for better understanding. I did like the colors they used in decorating the walls though."
"We had a wonderful time touring the Citadel with our guide, Man. There are so many great visuals as you tour the Citadel, and you will end up taking numerous photos. Of course, getting complete explanations about what we were seeing made it an even better experience.

For us, the Citadel and the three most popular imperial tombs were the highlights of our stay in Hue. We also recommend stopping at the Thien Mu Pagoda."
My expectations were very high and unfortunately our visit to the citadel couldn't fullfil these... far from actually!!
"We visited after lunch. The buildings were breath taking however we found it impossible to get information to support our tour and inform us what we were looking at. There are some information boards dotted around but they are inconsistent and tell you little of the place you stand and view. We could find no booklets to guide us, no tour guides and the buses that travelled the citadel had stopped or so we were told and we got there at 14:00hrs. So in summary a stunning area that left us frustrated."
"Visiting Hue without visiting the Imperial City is impossible. Though lots of the former imperial city were destroyed during the different wars, what is still left gives you at least an idea of the life of the former emperors. There's still a lot of renovation going on. Be sure to wear a cap or a sun hat, as it can get very hot in this place, where there 's little protection."
"This place is massive! You really do need a good few hours to look around properly. Try and remember how to get back to the exit as me and my friend ended up getting lost!

A good way to waste a few hours!"
"This was a quick motorbike ride from our hotel and was an obvious must do. We went during the day and walked around most of the complex. Wear a hat, the main road isn't very shaded."
"This place is probably why you've visited Hué and it doesn't disappoint. Wonderfully preserved Vietnamese architecture provides a wonderful backdrop within which you can spend hours walking around. I spent about 3 hours minimum in the Citadel looking round, taking pictures and relaxing, taking in my surroundings. Be aware though this isn't a museum, there isn't a lot of information about the buildings and the history of the Citadel. I walked around reading the history on my phone and that worked fine. If I remember rightly the entry fee is 150,000 Dong.

The Citadel is walkable from south of the river, if you're staying in a hostel in the City you can expect a 15 - 30 minute walked deepening on how far away you are. You will walk through a bus station on your way to the Citadel and there are a few restaurants serving extremely delicious food."
"Very impressive and amazing architecture; beautiful, ornated and intricate workmanship in temples and buildings. It's a peaceful and gorgeous place to visit. A must for anybody visiting Hué."
"Set aside the greater part of a day & take your time visiting this amazing, ancient citadel. The moat & outer wall, plus the ornate gateways are worth the visit alone. Once you get inside, there is a quiet magic to the Imperial City. As is the case everywhere in Vietnam, the spectre of the American War Of Aggression hangs over this historical site & a massive portion of the citadel was destroyed by American bombs, but you can still enjoy the areas that were untouched or have been restored. Make sure you stop at the Tea House & feed the Coy fish. This site is the main reason to visit Hue & a must see in my book."
Very impressive edifice in the center of Hue. Still in the process of being fully restored but the completed work is very well done. Lots to see and tons of information about the history of the city and the Imperial family. Makes for a great and informative walk.
"A moated palace called a Citadel, with the walls apparently designed by the French. But once inside, it looks pure Chinese to me. I could read most of the old signs and documents and my lovely local guide could not.
In terms of history, the Vietnamese acknowledge that the Chinese ruled over them in the first millenia AD. But this palace was built rather recently, 1800's so.....
Still, it is an interesting place in parklike setting, some covered paths, some tree lined boulevards. Most of the buildings were destroyed by the time of the American war so what we see are rebuilt and refurbished and exquisitely so!
The scale of the buildings is human, unlike the massive ones in Beijing's Forbidden City. Both have essentiilly the same floor plan, a square, a main gate in the south, then the throne room, then the Kings chambers and private quarters behding, a temple for ancestral worship to one side, rest and relax areas with miniatures or mountains and seas to ""rest your eyes upon"" - fascinating!
One unique feature is there are markers that look like tombstones - the guide said this was to help the mandarins line up in the courtyard to pay homage to the king! We see in movies how thousands of courtiers and soldiers lined up. But here, you look to your right and align yourself to the marker! ""Some of the darndest things remain"", I said to myself!
What I liked most were the large bronze cauldrons, original I'm told, so quite a piece of metlawork, beautifully finished!
I spent close to 2 hours here. I'm glad it drizzled so my visit was cool, and possibly less crowded.
I would suggest to the management that they sell tickets for those who cannot walk to much at the gate. Apparently you have to book 2 days in advance to ride the electric carts. Makes no sense to me why I can't pay for this added service at the gate!"
"Walked here from the south side of the city. It is a pleasant walk around the square in what is a historic area. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby. The entrance fee to the internal citadel is about 150,000dong/£5. It would be great if this wonderful place could have more information available to contextualise the history and the culture."
"One of the great sights in Southeast Asia, Hue's citadel is the cradle of Vietnam's history. Not as majestic as Beijing's Forbidden City, but possible modeled on it, this was the site from which Nguyen dynasty ruled the country. It is sprawling and if you want to do all of it properly, you may need more time, but a ""greatest hits"" version can be accomplished in just under two hours. Note that you will be walking a lot outdoors and it can get very hot, so dress appropriately."
"A pleasant centrally located Hotel with charming and helpful staff. Rooms capacious and comfortable, and clean, good pillows too. Restaurant area/bar comes alive with entertainment for all around 10pm. Happy hour fun."
"The temple complex is stunning at night and there are displays with fire.

Outside of the displays you can basically explore everything by yourself.

Takes a tripod for photos, or use the bridges to steady your camera for long exposures!"
"Very interesting. Lots of history. Heaps of photographs in the grounds. Option of small groups tour with a guide, but we decided to do our own thing. Allow a good hour for this place."
"Big scale, full of historical trace. I have known about 13th Nguyen dynasty...So beautiful place and this is a good destination to seek about historical prosess of Vietnam people!!!"
"Managed to get round most of this in an afternoon; it's great. The sections that haven't been restored after the US bombing are still interesting by their absence, but there are plenty of cool bits to look at still. The reading room and the tennis court are a few of the more hidden gems. The queen mother's palace is also great.

Don't forget sun cream; there are quite a few areas where there isn't much shade."
this is all within the citadel. the structure and architecture is worth the visit. you need to spend a bit of time to walk around and really enjoy this site. there is an entrance fees but its worth the visit.
Disappointed as bit run down & no maps to follow along with limited information boards through out site
"Stopped in Hue mainly to see this attraction as we travelled north. Went in the daytime.

Beautiful gardens and pagodas.
Especially the old corridor and the large residences were well kept.

Some buildings lovingly restored (and souvenir shops added)
Others are in disrepair and closed for entry, including the royal theatre when we went.

I understand there was damage during the war, however many buildings seem to have been re-built and painted but the inside and paintwork has again fallen into disrepair. It seemed we would walk a long hot way to see what looked like a forgotten holiday villa.

We didn't have a guide but many of the boards outside the buildings are translated into English.

Overall an enjoyable half day wander, but not a reason to stop in Hue if it's not in your plan!"
"Last night went to the Forbidden Purple Palace & Citadel 'Imperial City' recreation .

There was the changing of the guard ceremony, imperial martial arts demonstration with drum, imperial musicians performance, imperial games/ fire dance , and they also performed 'the Eight Immortals' dance & music performance.

Very much worth the 150,000 Dong!"
We visited the imperial citadel on a group tour. This is a smaller version of the Forbidden City in Beijing. It's impressive though and worth a vist. View of the citadel is grand and we get a glimpse of the history behind. The weather in May is however very hot and humid. Will be good to visit in a cooler month.
Make sure you have a guide with good english to explain the use of the buildings etc. 2.5sqkm so take a whole day and water as you'll need breaks. Still renovating and improving but the buildings are beautiful and the grounds very peaceful.
"The Imperial city, together with the forbidden city are a must see in Hue - get a combined ticket to see the tombs for the next day outside of the city; or if only one day for imperial sightseeing, the forbidden city and the three most important tombs - Tu Duc's, Kai Dinh's and Minh Mangs's can be visited in the morning and afternoon respectively. The imperial city is huge, however due to being almost completely destroyed during the war and currently still in reconstruction, little can be seen and learned about the life of the emperors, so a targeted visit of few buildings can save time and long walking between buildings from one end to the other. The Royal theatre is one of the buildings not to be missed. The evening show in the citadel including guard change, traditional dances and music performances and fighting is not to be missed; a day ticket for the citadel gives a 50% discount for the evening show ticket in the citadel. The evening show starts at about 19.30-20h; and the citadel closes at 18h.We wanted to go out of the citadel for dinner, however we chatted with some tourists who decided to stay in between the citadel walls, in the park, after closure and wait for the show - one of the guards told us in that case there will be no charge for an evening ticket."
"Hue is very humid & hot, so foolish tourists buy guided tours of this place in daytime. Recently, night entry is available for the same ticket price of VND150k... don't need a guide, just explore. Lighting is spectacular, there are performances in various locations, and hardly any visitors, so it was a magical experience, where i was alone in corridors, rooms, gardens!"
The citadel gives foreigners a peek into the physic of the Vietnamese people: Communist ideology and reverence for ancient history and adoration for emperors and ancestress become one in the citadel. Buildings and grounds are beautifully maintained. All information is available in Vietnamese and English.
"I am a history enthusiast. I found this site to be very interesting, as I walked all around the site. There are many picture taking opportunities."
"a fantastic place to go and see the historical capital of vietnam. You could spend hours walking through the acres of the Imperial City looking at everything from ancient temples, to the bullet pock marks, a remnant of the Vietnam War."
Amazing tour. We visited this as part of a full day tour and this was definitely a case of the best saved until last. The imperial city is impressive and is situated over a large are. Very pretty and Serene !
"If you come to Hue, you need to go to the Citadel. It's a run down version of the Forbidden City in Beijing.. Understandable because of all the bombs that it took in under the war. I recommend going super early (I was there at 7:30am). There was only another tour group (impressive how early they got there). They also have little performances here and there, make sure you get the schedule.
I bought the combo ticket because I wanted to visit the Royal Tombs the next day (the ticket last for 2 calendar days, not 48 hours as some reviews said).
You get 50% off the night entry ticket if you show them you bought the day ticket. So I also went at night where they have different performances and activities happening. (I went on the first week they open up at night, 4/22-28). I would recommend to go both day & night, they're different experiences. If you can only choose one, I would pick day so you can see the details of the buildings."
"This was a fascinating place to visit.
You need to have a tour guide to really appreciate the history of the citadel otherwise it is just a lot of buildings.
Our tour guide Hung from insider travel was excellent"
"It's well worth a visit while in Hue.

One thing to watch out for is the cyclo drivers offering an hour tour of the city. While this might sound tempting in the gruelling heat, they are not allowed into the Forbidden city/Imperial palace.

They also told us we were going the wrong direction and that it was closed when walking towards the official entrance, so don't believe everything you hear..."
"Strongly recommend to visit if you are in Vietnam. Exhibition tells a lot about history of royal family (Nguyen Dinasty). Try to visit in the early morning, as the visit requirs 3-4 hours walking inside the Citadel."
"we thought the place was a bit dreary, and did not really think they should be re building the buildings with new ones, rather should preserve the ruins better"
"We were staying in Da Nang and visited Hue on a private tour with hoi an private guide tour. The company and guide were brilliant and we had used them earlier in the week . Well worth the visit and a day trip is filled with the Citadel, 2 moseleums, lunch in Hue which was the best so far and so much more.local large Market- not to be missed😃"
It is an interesting place for a good understanding of the Vietnam dynasty as well as the cultural part of it.
"an amazing place, so much history and beauty behind these marvellous buildings . . . highly recommended 👍👍👍"
"This place is a must visit. It's near city center. Come at daylight to explore and at night to see some of performances, so you can feel both different experience.
Entrance fee 150.000 vnd.
Unfortunately when we came at night, it was crowded even though we visit on Tuesday night.
They have special line for tourist, so better to take this line to enter since it's less crowded."
"The Citadel is a spectacular monument which for size and beauty is comparable to the forbidden city in Beijing. The place is the center of town, across the river, and it is a massive structure with moats, gates, walls, pavilions and gardens stretching several blocks. You should plan at least half a day and an easily available guide would be helpful.
In spite of the recent heavy bombing and destruction, there are several glorious buildings intact."
We found the sites and history of the Citadel fascinating. I would recommend have a guide to explain the history of what you are seeing. It contains the Forbidden City must like you see in China.
"Very glad we went here, it's much larger and comprehensive than we imagined. We just wandered around on our own, signage is not great but easy enough to do. There are guides available at the main entrance where you buy your ticket but bless you want detailed history you should be okay on your own.

It's a huge site and you should allow at least two hours to wander around. Plenty of covered areas during peak sun periods to hide and many fans in the exhibition areas.

There are also many story boards dotted around to give an over view.

Try and take a map of the layout as it can be quite confusing.... and you could miss areas without a map quite easily.

Very glad we went here and would certainly recommend a visit."
"A Long Day, 3hrs each way by coach, but worth it. Few stops along the way, Marble Mountain, such beautiful scenery, amazing history."
"An amazing fortress, so much to see, but becomes tedious after a while as the site has similar monuments etc"
Unfortunately I just had two hours to visit the place as it was a one day tour from Hoi An. The place is amazing and tells a bit of history of Vietnam.
Why early? To avoid the heat and the tourists ! At 7:30 AM it was already 30C in May but we were almost alone. Fabulous! And take a guide who will save you time and lead you to the main points of interest as the place is really huge.
Incorporates the Emporer's history and the gardens of the wives and concubines. Truly well worth the visit.
"This place is very large. There were a few map boards around but not quite enough. Take a picture of the map when you see it to make your day easier.

Some parts were under construction May of 2017.

Going in the morning is a good idea as it gets really hot and most of the waking you'll do is outside.

It's worth seeing but the experience can be long and ""dry"". I bet hiring a guide that speaks your language would make it more interesting."
"Felt like this was a waste of time.
Most of the buildings are gone due to the wars so it's a lot of empty fields with random things in place .
Few corridors that survived with picture paintings on them. That's a bout it , real waste of time ."
Really interesting place to visit. Take the time to watch the video in the room behind the throne room. There is a fan if you need a break from the heat and it is really great to see the before and after shots of the palace and surrounds. Amazing work being done by everyone involved. Absolutely worth the ticket price.
"This is a very interesting place and worth the 150,000 vdn to get in. I would recommend printing off some information at the citadel or getting the guide book at the kiosk.
Wear comfortable shoes as it is a lot of walking."
The citadel was amazing however a lot of walking we had an amazing tour guide Mr Hoa so informative and patient with all the questions great tour.
"This was an unexpectedly great experience for us. All buildings are lit up beautifully while you can enjoy several performances (martial arts training, music,...). The execution is still far from perfect as this ""by night"" thing is relatively new, but charming nonetheless."
We found the the video interesting. But our favourite part was the chance to sit in the shade for a cold drink in the former pleasure pavilion on the lake!
"An amazing site and well worth visiting. TIP: on the way back through, you can walk around the side along the banks of the river running through - pretty and different setting (also slightly more shade!)"
"Amazing place, every corner filled with history. Although much was damaged in the wars, there is still plenty to see. We were there for two hours as part of our tour but we could have stayed there longer. You get a real feel of what is must have been like when the kings lived there,. If you go in the evenig there is music and lights and so should be very pretty. You can buy some food to feed the carp which are huge. The frangipani are flowering at the moment and the scent is very nice."
I have great time inside imperial city. I staying at my city (of course Hue city) longtime ago but this is first time i walk inside citadel at night. So many light and program for explore. We haved knowledge better about culture and kingdoms Nguyen.
"We got two Cycle guys to take us which was fun and worth it otherwise it's a bit of a walk. They have a screen that shows you a digital reconstruction of how it used to look (most buildings got destroyed in the war) but you still get to see some of the beautiful temples / halls. We got a buggy for 40,000 dong each and it was fab as they take you round and let you have time to look inside the buildings. Some let you take photos but there is the odd one that doesn't (we took pics of the grounds and inside) worth reading about it all in advance too!"
"We were really surprised because some forums dislike this place. It's fantastic, part of the history of Vietnam. Even if there are still too many works, the principal buildings are really well renovated. We loved it"
"A must for Hue. Tickets are 120k vnd/person. you can keep the tickets and bring it back to get in at night for half the price. At night, they have shows."
"Amazing history from the early 1800s. Built by 10,000 workers. Still in fantastic condition. Well worth a visit. Restoration work has been carried out since the damage that took place from 1947 and 1968 wars."
"The price for entry appears a bit steep for the sights inside, which seemed limited. There are timings to enter so check that out (closes by 5 PM and re-opens at 7 PM or something like that). You can buy a morning ticket and get an entry at night for half the price. Seeing it at night is worth it though. It's resplendent. About the only thing to do in Hue anyway."
"We engaged VM travel in Hue for three different tours and had Bingo for this tour.
He was just great to us. It was very hot and we needed frequent rests. His knowledge of the palace was extensive and helped us understand the importance of this place. A dragon boat ride back to the center of Hue was underwhelming to say the least.
If using VM travel and I recommend that you do, please ask for Bin."
"The citadel was well worth it but could do with better signage. The introduction video in the first building was very informative. Our guidebook luckily had a whole section on the citadel that we used to navigate. Wear comfortable shoes & sunscreen and allow a couple of hours for it. There are a couple of cafes within the grounds for cold drinks & icecreams. Our favourite places were the temple area, the gardens near the theatre & the area where the emperors mother used to reside."
We were most fortunate in that our tour guide was able to impart such interesting facts about the history and construction of this incredible site .This site requires more time than most tours allow .I thoroughly enjoyed every moment .A real step back in time and a place not to be missed .Remember a hat and plenty of water ....
"Light misting rain was the perfect backdrop to explore the Citadel the Imperial City in Hue, a map, a guide that speaks your language will enrich your experience. If, you get the opportunity go in a small group & share the guide. Do try and avoid the large tour groups with megaphones, so that you can soak up the atmosphere and imagine the courtiers of the past scurrying across the cobble stones to attend to important matters. Pause a few moments for the perfect selfie or group shot unless you an ancient city architectual art history professor who would prefer a crowd free photo. Do allow yourself at least 2 hours to explore, however you could easily spend longer for a less hurried experience. Oh, yes you can go alone just buy an entrance ticket and wander at whim !"
"Seems pointless for a first visit to Hue not to see this historic site. Lots of old buildings with lots of old photos of the emperor dynasty days. We did not her a guide so may have missed some significant stuff but we enjoyed a couple of hours wandering through. To see the whole place would take a day and a lot of walking in heat. Be careful of venders at the entrance. ..One tried to take a 500,000 dong note as a 50,000 thinking we tourists may be confused by the money. Only place this has happened us in vietnam."
"Very pleasant to walk around and enjoy the environment. Better take your time and enjoy a half day there, no need to rush :)"
This place is massive. We spent a good 2-3 hours here and only just skimmed the surface. You could easily spend twice as long.
"The citadel is very expansive, have to time your visits to the sites and temples to miss the crowds as some are quite small. There is lots of walking involved unless you hire a cart to go around. It is however not well signed and even some of the signs are quite decieving, so If you can get your hands on a map it is good to do so. Would come back again."
Once in Hue you can not miss this splendid place. The architecture and the history of this place is very interesting.
"It now opens from 7pm, the whole place is lit up amazingly, it was a wonderful evening! There were lots of cultural performances too, fire dancing, traditional music, dancing and acting.
After seeing lots of Chinese temples, it was great to experience a different atmosphere by viewing it at night!"
Quite a large old citadel. Best spots still unrestored. The old theatre was also quite well done. Intro film good
"Battled the mad public holiday crowds today and survived. Once inside the main gate we took a left away from the bus loades of tourists and it was very quiet. Absolutely stinking hot there today, even at 8am. My hubby was looking closely at the walls and lo and behold found a live unexploded mortor shell...i managed to convince him that yes that would be considered an explosive and no he could not bring it home on the plane. So back in the walk it went. This will be his biggest regret in life no doubt!!"
A large historic site still being repaired after US devastation. Varies from ruins to fully restored temples. There is a lot of walking so make sure you have adequate sun protection.
"Would definitely come back, amazing tour. Me and my friend had such a good time. Thank you so much team"
"This beautiful citadel and palac structures are so gorgeous and rich with history. Sadly as you may know , a lot of the buildings have been destroyed because of war. Never the less they are restoring it and in 15 years will have it back to its former glory."
"This is large complex and you really need at least half a day to see everything. Just when you think you have seen everything, you walk through an archway or door and there is another courtyard and buildings to explore.

You could not go to Hue without going to The Citadel.

Wear sunscreen...its hot and there is not a lot of shade!"
"We had one night only in Hue and naturally the plane was delayed so by the time we got to the citadel we had one hour before closing.

Granted we walked very quickly but in my opinion, had we more time we still would have only been 2 hours max.

It was very pretty to look at in terms of the grounds and building structures. Not a whole host of information but worth a few hours on the itinerary. You can easily imagine how grand it would have been back in the day.

Also they now open the citadel by night but I believe it is more performance based (changing of the guards etc). It's open 7-10pm."
"Huge complex, lots to see, allow 4 hours, go early to avoid the heat. The traditional costume guards are colourful and novelty"
"I did not know what to expect, but found the citadel a very impressive place. Had no idea the grounds were so big you could imagine how grand it must have been. Really enjoyed the trip and would recommend it to everyone."
"The imperial City was a nice place with old architecture, Unfortunately it was not the most informative if you decide to do your own tour. Signs was only what was necessary without much elaboration. If you ate big into history would suggest you get a tour guide"
"We visited this as part of a full day tour and this was definitely a case of the best saved until last. We have wanted to visit Hue w
For a few years now and this dis NOT disappoint. Well worth the visit and our guide from Hue Private Excursions was so informative it made the day so much more interesting."
"This is a really fascinating place.
We visited as part of a wider city tour with a guide and I think we got a lot more out of the visit with the information the guide provided than we ever could have done if we had visited on our own.
Its a very big site with a lot of historical significance, some of it has been lost due to various wars, with some walls still showing signs of bullet holes, but a lot of it remains intact.
I suspect we were probably there for around 3 hours and I don't think you could do it justice in much less.
Recommended."
"We went for the special opening of the citadel at night which included some interesting local dance and music. The place opened at 7 and was very busy mainly with locals. The entrance is quite expensive at 150k dong per person. The entertainment was enjoyable and gave a taste of local culture. The citadel itself was average, the lighting at night was poorly done so you could not really see most of the buildings and some buildings are being renovated."
"A most unbelievable experience to walk thru these extremely old buildings,if only the walls could talk,so much history and such a short time to see some of it."
"We visited in the daytime - can't comment on the night (I think it is a bit more spectacular)!

It was good to see - I am personally more a fan of ancient buildings and ruins, so it wasn't my favourite! It's 150,000 fir a ticket, and extremely hot during the day!

The interior is impressing, very gold!
Some of the gardens are lovely!"
"We were only in Hue for one night on a stop over between Hanoi and Hoi-an.
We asked our hotel what to see in Hue and they advised us that the Imperial Palace was being opened to the public for the first time in many years.
The Emperor had vacated the palace nearly 70 years ago and covering over 75 acres the estate had fallen into disrepair. Whilst the government has made great strides in getting the estate to a point where it is open to the public once more there is still a lot of work yet to be carried out.
Being the first night opening, getting in was like being at an old fashioned football match. At one point I was literally lifted off my feet whilst the crowd surged through the tiny entrances."
"We have visited citadel taking a cyclo from our hotel. At least two hours is the time you need to explore it. Its good to have a detailed map with you. The cyclo was outside waiting for us, don't worry they will find you, but be sure and say the price before not after the trip!"
The Imperial city is impressive and is situated over a large area..good to set aside 2 hours to see everything and to read the stories of each building.
"Reserve at least 3 hours to see the Imperial city. It has wonderful architecture, excellent presentations to put it in historical context, and beautiful mosaics (some of them made, if you look closely, out of broken, beautifully painted ceramic pots and plates.)"
"The citadel and the Royal Palace where very nice.
The Pagoda was also nice.
We visited the Toumb Ming Mang.
Beautiful surrounding and a good information made it complete.
You should visit Hue and surroundings.
At least 2 days you will need to do this program."
"The Citadel is remarkable, but without a guide I missed a lot of the historical context. I'd strongly recommend getting one. Even without a guide its still impressive and beautiful. Its a bit crowded, but that's too be expected for one of the top attractions in the city. The gardens are beautiful and were largely empty when we went, which was nice and serene."
"A must visit in Hué. It’s a big complex although it used to be much bigger. Very pretty and serene, do take some time to vistit here."
"Visited the citadel this morning. Buying tickets is a little confusing (or at least it was for us!). If you want to visit the citadel and two or three tombs later then it's cheaper to buy one of the combined tickets as tickets for individual tombs er 100,000 each if you buy them later. Citadel is huge and easy to lose your bearings but fine if you have downloaded a Google map of Hue... Allow a couple of hours."
Many pagoda in this place. But the weather is so hot. Summer is burning. Humidity is very low. It is very big Imperial and need to renovate a bit from government
"An amazing place to visit at anytime day or night, the sheer scale and history will blow you away. Number one attraction in Hue. We stayed in a hotel within the citadel but the local town is a cheap taxi ride away."
"Amazing lights, sights and atmosphere. Felt very magical by night - especially when beautiful walks led to full musical performances amongst the trees."
Interesting look back at history & former glory of this Imperial city. Lovely gardens. Ornate architecture.
"First impression: it's a really big place, if I'm in the royal family, I'm gonna be so sick walking around the area.

As I explore further, I realized I should probably engage a tour guide so that he/she can fill me in with all the buildings and heritage of the citadel. Honestly speaking, I think the citadel is so much nicer than Gyeongbukgong in Seoul, Korea (I haven been to the forbidden palace in Beijing so I can only compare this two), I just wished they would put more effort in the restoration of the palace. Even though the citadel is old, I guess the degradation and damage can be put to a halt or slow down given the fact that the entrance ticket is pricier than the rest of the attractions."
"Take your time and really look around. We really loved seeing the buildings that were still there, either original or rebuilt. Unfortunately Hue was a pretty long and fierce battle as we found out by researching in over the free WiFi at the cafe. If you look around you can still see bullet holes in some walls. The 9 Dynastic Urns still bear scars from the bullets. We look forward to returning at a later date to see what has been rebuilt. Make sure you take the time to explore the gardens to relax and enjoy the peace"
"If you come to Hue, this place is the must. You'd better get tour guide. The signs in the palace is not good for selt-touring."
Just a wonderful sight to visit. Not to be missed! We went around noon though and it was too hot and humid. Better if you do it late afternoon. But it is such a beautiful place to spend time at.
"We spent 4 hours here and still did not see everything. I highly recommend booking a tour guide (from the building on the right just in front of the main entrance, beyond the ticket office) Our guide was enthusiastic and knowledgeable and definitely enhanced our visit."
"A must to visit if you are in Hue. Beautiful place, gives a good idea of how history was made around Hue. We were suprised how much we enjoyed it. The information around is well presented with specific details of the imperial city, well worth a visit!"
Great place to walk around and get lost in. It's huge so you really feel like you are having your own adventure. May secret gardens and rooms to visit. I'm sure we didn't see it all but had a great afternoon
"Great day out, we didn't think it would be so good.
100 characters?
What more do they need than a great day out"
"This apparently is Hu'e no1 tourist attra tion. What remains is impressive but it appears it has suffered from degradation and damage during the Vietnam war. It is spread over 25 acres but I would say there is only about 25% of the buildings remaining although they are replacing the damaged ones but it will take years. Cost to get in to the area is 150,000vd."
"Just 3 minutes walk from Hue bus station which is the central drop off/pick up point, you think it's going to be crowded. But this is a huge sprawling city and once past the main South gate, the crowds quickly disperse. There were lots of local visitors, wedding couple and school kids taking picture along the avenue, very entertaining slice of local life.

Laid out in a grid, you won't get lost, but tons of different tombs, temples and palaces to explore in peace. Wear walking shoes, you'll easily traverse 4-5Km on cobbled pavements. Note everyone exits via the West gate past the museum where there's a little cafe so it's good meeting point should you split up."
"For about $AU10 the Imperial City was interesting but not a must see. Most of the original buildings are long gone due to bombings and natural disasters, so a lot of the buildings remaining are 18-19 century."
"The Imperial City is fantastic. Make sure you wear your walking shoes and allow plenty of time, it's massive. Photographers dream location."
But we definitely expected to see more. We have to admit that we visited this place on our own but due to the heat we did not want to spend 3 hours with our kids. The place is nice but the there are very limited buildings to see.
"This is a must see when in Hue. It is a source of major pride of the people of this region, make sure you take water as it was very hot when we were there."
"Hue has become a great landscape and architectural site. Hue' royal complex has been officially recognized by the UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. This is a massive area and takes alot of time to see. We spent around 3 hours there. Best is to take a tour guide. The grounds of the Imperial City are protected by fortified ramparts 2 kilometers by 2 kilometers, and ringed by a moat. This enclosure is the citadel. Inside the citadel is the Imperial City, with a perimeter wall some 2.5 kilometers in length."
There isn't much to see in terms of buildings as so much was destroyed But I enjoyed wandering round on my own to get a sense of the history of the place. I did my own research beforehand to understand the significance of the place.. It is slowly being restored. There is not much in terms of information boards.
"From a family's perspective, this is a great place to visit. Kids have lots of space to roam without feeling unsafe.

There's obviously a lot of history on this site, but don't expect it to be on the scale of comparable palaces in places like Europe or china. Unfortunately a few parts of it are derelict, either from ?bombing or poor maintenance. If they had the means for proper restoration, this could live up to its UNESCO status."
This is a major attraction of Hue. There are tour guides who speak English who are available at the entrance on an official basis.
"The Imperial City is really a place worth the visit if you come to Hué, it is just pure history. A MUST defenetly."
"A well planned and memorable experience - our guide was informative and knowledgable, the cyclos were great fun getting there and the tour itself was amazing!"
"Heard a lot about it but a bit disappointed. It locates in the huge place and is very good sightseeing but most of the most historical monument has gone, like Tu Cam Thanh,...I did expect to see them."
"Get ready to spend 3-4hours walking when you get there.The entire place is quiet imposing. Covers huge ground. On a hot day, it could be bit of struggle. Keep sunscreen and lots of water handy. The construction, culture and heritage value is quiet remarkable and worth the time. A must do for all ages.
PS - Need reasonable time and fitness level to soak in and enjoy the ambience."
We spent a few hours exploring the imperial city and loved it. The history is amazing. Very large site that seems never ending. Definitely a must see place in Hue.
"Of course one of the main tourist sights, but for 150.000 vnd entry not too much to see, finished it for nice picture taking in 1 hour.

If you want/need a guide to inform you more it takes about 2hours."
"One of the main attractions in Hue and easy walking distance from the town. It costs 150,000vnd to get into just the citadel, but there are combination tickets available if you also plan on doing the tombs. We bought a ticket for the citadel and 2 tombs for 280,000vnd each and went to the tombs the next day as they are valid for 2 days (entry for each tomb is 100,000vnd so bit of a saving). The citadel itself is nice to walk around for a few hours, although there is not much explanation in english so would recommend taking a guidebook with you or reading up beforehand. There are a few cafes inside which are a bit pricey, and stands where you can buy water. The gardens and moat at the back of the complex are nice."
If you are in Hue you must go to the imperial city as its very beautiful. A lot of it has been destroyed by the war but they are doing a very nice work re building lots of structures. The only thing i do not recommend is getting a guide from the ticket office. As they are not informative and all time wanting to end the tour. We had a better time on our own and there is written information every place you go.
"If it is hot (like every day), this tour can be very intense and you need to be of good health.
Besides that, the""city"" is very interesting - a professional tour guide is strongly recommended, you get lots of insider information."
The main attraction in Hue it covers a large area. Plenty of tourists here and there is a lot to see. There is some splendid architecture and there is of course a temple or two. Dome of the buildings were destroyed in the Vietnamese war but overall a good place to see. Take a package deal that includes all the tombs and the pagoda.
"My wife, sister and I visited the site with our guide Peter. It is beautiful and give one a real sense of the pageantry and grandness of the rulers. A very memorable visit we highly recommend."
"I really enjoyed my visit to the palace. It's a real shame the place fell victim to war. We spent between 2 to 3 hours here looking through the different buildings, reading info poster and looking at info dvds. There plenty to see with restoration efforts in full flight. Be sure to check out the display of old war machines and planes close by which entry is included in the admission for the palace."
A large central complex with palaces and pagodas to visit. Lots of lovely information at museums and places to drink and buy souvenirs or art work. Quiet and tranquil.
"A tour guide is essential to understand the layout and the significance of the palace and the buildings.

We spent hours there. It is definitely worth seeing, but it’s more important to know the history because the majesty is long gone. The area is massive but many of the buildings are shells.
It has a special significance nevertheless."
Well worth a visit as the buildings and gates are beautiful. Take a stroll in the gardens and enjoy the atmosphere.
"Worth the visit. Antiquity. But, take a sunbrella because it is hot! Take dong as once you get north of Hoi An dollars are not accepted everywhere.
The area where the emperors family lived was damaged during the war and is not yet rebuilt."
It was absolutely amazing!!!!!! I'm so glad to have made it here! I got to see the sunset as well which was gorgeous! We headed there at 4h30pm so it was perfect time for it.But we did not know it was closed at 6ish so we were pretty rush checking out in here. Wish we had had more time to just chill in the citadel! Its a must to visit if you are in Hue!!
"Spent few hours here. It is definitely worthy to see, but don't expect something majestic. The area is massive but most of the buildings are ruins and only the layout is preserved."
"We spend our entire afternoon walking around the citadel. It has been destroyed during the war but has been renovated quite nicely. With the tombs around Hue, a definitively must do to understand Vietnam 18-19 and beginning of the 20th century."
A MUST to visit if you are in Hue. Beautiful place. Kind of botanic garden mixed with historical buildings.
"This is a very large complex similar in size to the one in Beijing. One could spend the better part of a day here, but we were here slightly more than an hour. Be prepared to do a lot of walking and bring some cold water with you. Best seen with a guide."
It was a sweltering 40 C when we went. We also decided against a guide as the cost we already 150.000 dong each. The site is large but not exceptionally beautiful. There is very little information posted around the site for those not taking the guides tours. Very underwhelming. Maybe with a tour it would be better.
This is the main attraction in Hue.. gives a good idea of how history was made around this era. The information around is well presented with specific details of the imperial city
"This was a very nice place to visit. We were surprised how much we enjoyed it. It's quite large and makes for a great walk.
Go early to avoid the crowds!"
"Different, seen many types around Asia, this is good it is being kept tourist and traffic friendly. If never seen before this style, is a worthwhile visit."
Entertaining and informative English speaking student tour guide. Learned so much VN history and culture. Great teaching style and fast-paced city tour with market shopping and lunch with locals. Excellent value
"A must do on a visit to Hue. The history and extent of the attraction, including how it fits in Vietnamese culture, was interesting. Would greatly recommend doing this with one of the guides. Booking the guide at the same time as ticket purchase and then following directions at the entrance was easy.
Thanks to our guide Anh, she provided great information over an hour and we were then able to explore further at our leisure. We found that this style of information provision suited us well."
"Make sure you have your walking shoes as this place is huge. Set on 3 1/2 hectares the citadel stretches forever but is steeped in the history of the Vietnamese emperors. It's such a shame the communist government let it crumble and it was damaged in the Vietnam war, but there is restoration going on. Give yourself at least an 1-2 hours to take it all in. Don't leave Hue without seeing this place."
"Really interesting, we enjoyed it more than the forbidden city in Beijing. It took about 2.5 hours to walk around. We had our own guide book but guides were available. There are places to buy water and souvenirs....one necessary the other not intruding on the general ambiance! Well worth a visit."
This is an extensive walking tour and a good guide makes this an amazing site to visit. War damage is evident by the number of buildings destroyed. Although restoration is funded by Unesco progress is slow.
"This UNESCO World Heritage site is a good stop to make, where you can spend a much time as you want, depending on your interests. Once the home of the Imperial family, the Citadel took a beating during the Vietnam War but much remains to give you a sense of the early days of the palace and life behind its walls.

There's lots to explore in terms of gateways, gardens and courtyards. After late April, there's also additional things to see and do - photo of the listing is included."
"We made the mistake of leaving our visit to the Citadel until late in the afternoon trying to avoid the heat of the day. The area is not well signed so it took ages to find the entrance and ended up only having an hour to enjoy what deserved much more than a power walk albeit it in complete awe. Take note the gates close at 5pm.

In true Vietnamese style there are few rules and barriers so you can actually get in and immerse yourself in this piece of history. It is also a cool and breezy part of what can otherwise be a fairly oppressively hot town. There is no point trying to describe its beauty or even post pictures it won't do it justice. Go take water and give yourself time."
"Unique insight in to a vanished world
A lot of restoration work being carried out but this detract from an enjoyable visit .
You can't come to Hue and not see it"
"We walked around the imperial city for about an hour which was enough time to get an appreciation for its history and architecture.

The buildings have been mostly restored and there are some great photos of imperial times.

Avoid the cafe !! The food is terrible and the service chaotic."
"We spent a half day on 1 April 2017 visiting the Imperial City, which was a fascinating start to our trip around Vietnam and definitely not to be missed. It is also essential to see the mausoleums and tombs around Huê to really benefit a stay in the area."
"This magnificent old capital of Vietnam is very special, the ruins are truly great it is a shame that so much of it was destroyed during the fighting in 1968. The ruins give an insight to the original capital and the very early rulers of Vietnam"
"The first thing you'll visit if you decide to go to Hue. It took me 2,5 hours to go around the Imperial City. The Entrance fee is higher, but it worth for the price. The complex is partly renovated so you'll also see some ruins. The complex has 5 parts. I like the style, however, I didn't feel the ""wow"" effect. But it is definitely must go place. :)"
We greatly enjoyed our visit to this fascinating city. It is necessary to use one's imagination to visualise the grandeur of the city but great efforts have been made to restore it after the ravages of war. We liked the Hien Lam Pavilion and the Dynastic Urns in front of it. It is well worth a visit.
"We spent a really interesting four hours here. Lots to see and explore. Best to research it before you go, or carry a good travel guide round with you."
"I enjoyed walking around the Citadel, it was somewhat busy in parts but an interesting place to go to learn some of vietnams ancient history. Mid April I think it is open after dark too which would be a good time to go I think."
We paid 150D each to go in but decided against a guide. I think we would have enjoyed it more with a guide which you can get on site for another 150D but as it's was about 40 degrees we didn't think we would be able to stay very long. The complex is huge and still so beautiful despite the Damage and reconstruction have begun. It's very easy to get lost but there is lots of shade. Bring water as they charge a ridiculous 25D per bottle inside and ice creams and 50! If you are going to spend all day there then go for the guides option :)
A must do for Hue. We had a great time and learned a lot about the Nguyen dynasty. Very important and beautiful.
"We enjoyed our tour of the Imperial City. While most of it was destroyed in the war and is in the process of being rebuilt, they show videos so that you can see what it looked like back in the days of the kings. It provides great insight into the history of the country. A must see while in Hue."
"We visited on a hot day in March- arrived and bought tickets at the booth- we also purchased a ticket for a guide ,however when we went to the guide pick up area only to discover an English speaking guide wasn't available.The staff weren't awfully helpful and couldn't tell us when one would be available.-- This meant returning to the outside booth and waiting ages for a refund.
We decided to visit without a guide and spent about 2-3 hours-- really worth visiting- able to gather enough to make this an interesting visit..There is a short video which explains the basics.The buildings on the left are more interesting."
"Hue Imperial City is almost an identical mini copy of the Forbidden City in Beijing but mostly in ruins. Worth the visit, but if you have been to Beijing it does not compare as to it is mostly falling down or destroyed"
"Very impressive fortifications, palaces and gardens. Large gold coloured dragon in rear gardens. Very hot so bring plenty cold water or buy onsite. Get transport back to main city across river as it's really too far to walk in the heat, despite what the hotel might say! Buy fish food as you enter to feed the hungriest fish I've ever seen!"
"We had a great tour, but be prepared for rain in Hue- it does rain a lot.
Interesting and worthwhile trip which helps in the understanding of Vietnam's history"
"Must visit. Really nice and interesting place to visit and discover history of the country. Great palaces, temples, architecture, landscape. Walking for about 3 hours and it was not enough. Most interesting objects are on the left side."
"I was impressed by the tranquility of the vast space, despite all the tour groups milling around. Do it on your own and take your time; you will get much more value out of the experience.
Although not fully restored like the Forbidden City in Beijing, the Imperial City at Hue offers its own charm."
"If you are in Hue, don't skip on visiting the Citadel. Ensure you have a local guide to so you have some insight into the history and cultural understanding of the site. Some buildings are being still being restored or rebuilt after being destroyed during the Vietnam war. Quite an impressive complex of architecture, canals and gardens. Allow a good half day to fully appreciate this place."
"What has been restored of the citadel is nice and they have some interesting picture gallery displays but very little information to tell you what anything is. There is a 5-10 minute info video and a few English signs but very little else - for the cost 150,000 it was a shame."
"The Citadel is the most significant attraction in Hue and covers a large area so you need to allocate a minimum of 4 hours to do it justice. The style looks very old but it was constructed at the start of the 1800s. Parts of the city have been badly damaged as a result of the Vietnam war and some areas have crumbled due to lack of maintenance which is a real shame. The site comprises small villages, temples, palaces, gardens and lakes.
It has been home to the emperors so there is a throne room, an area where emperors lived, other residences for emperors wives and relations. There is so much to see here but it's best tackled with a good guide."
"This is a 200 yr old smaller version of the forbidden city in Beijing that is under restoration. We enjoyed wandering around, and in fact enjoyed the unrestored bits more than the shiny new bits. There's a fair amount of information in English, but luckily we had someone with us who also knew a lot of the history to complement it. No amount of money could get us a tour ride in a motorised cart, but we survived walking. The cicadas are the loudest we've ever heard! An interesting stop."
"This is a fascinating place, full of culture from many eras. The grounds are beautiful with gardens and canals."
"This is a must-see if you’re in Hue. We arranged an all-day tour of Hue via our hotel. The tour guide did an excellent job, but one could spend an entire day at the Citadel. It's big, with a variety of beautiful sights."
"Excellent tour around the citadel and Purple Forbidden City. Tour guide knowledgable and helpful, plenty of buildings in good condition to give good insight into it's former state."
"Lots of people told us to skip Hue and spend more time at the beach. Don't skip Hue it's amazing and the Citadel is the jewel in its crown. Beautiful and impressive, sad that so much was destroyed during the war but still there's so much to see there. Their ancient architecture is stunning. Not to be missed !"
"On a very hot day we visited the imperial city of Hue. This is a must see in Hue. Since we had the time, we took the time. At a very slow pace we strolled around the area. After 2,5 hours we still hadn't see the whole place.
Make sure to take a lot of water, sun hats, sunblock on hot days. We didn't take a guide, but I guess you might want to do this when you want to know more about the history of this place.
The kids loved it as well. Every now and then we escaped the sun and hide in a temple.
Great day out!"
"It was breezy when we were there. Brought stroller along for our 2.5yrs old as we read there will be lots of walking. Not too much of a hassle despite no segregated wheelchair or stroller access. Had to carry it over steps, which wasn't too bad.

Attractions are old palaces and temple, courtyard and gardens. There's a small cafe for drinks and ice cream. There's also buggy service for a minimal fee, which we didn't manage to get one as it was all taken. My father-in-law (80+) decided to walk and it was ok for him. At the end of the palace tour, we took a boat ride across Perfume River, arranged by Tour From Hue (Chong Anh). Overall it was a good 2-3hours for us."
"This was a fascinating place to visit, 150,000 VND entrance was well worth it. We spent hours wandering around, there were lots of photos and explanations in English. Some beautiful architecture, such a shame most of the buildings were subjected to bombing and lost. Well worth the visit - don't go to Hue and miss out on this.

Take plenty of water to drink it can get very hot!"
Despite the negative reviews of Hue we had an amazing day sightseeing. The Citadel is well worth spending time exploring. If sunny bring plenty of water.
"Definitely a must see on your visit to Hue. Although we did this in the late afternoon (after 4pm) after a city tour, it ended up working out well as it was cooler and it was less crowded. Also, although their entry gates close we were able to wander freely until we left at around 5:30pm."
The Citadel is well a maintained site. All visitors to Hue must see this place considering that it was the original capital of Vietnam.
"The Imperial City is a walled palace within the citadel in the city of Hue, the former imperial capital of Vietnam. Built in 1362, it is considered a symbol of wealth and power. Although this is an amazing facility and we enjoyed our tour through it, we had already toured the Forbidden City and Summer Palace of China which have been beautifully restored. The Imperial City in Hue is still in disrepair, much of it left over from the War, scars still visible. It appears they are working on restoration, but for the most part it is sad to see it has not been fully restored. Still worth a visit though ..."
"Beautiful grounds with many structures restored or preserved from over 200 years ago. A great way to learn about Vietnam's history (their 13 kings and all the ensuing drama!).

Would highly recommend using one of their guides (150k vnd/hr)."
"I arrived in Hue not really knowing what to expect, but when I visited the imperial Citadel I was blown away. The scale was much grander that I thought, almost similar to Beijing's Forbidden City. Made me appreciate more the rich culture and history of Vietnam."
"I loved this citadel, even though we only visited the outside of some of the wall, the front of the imperial city, and the forbidden city. It is really beautiful, but inside some of the buildings, you cannot take pictures because of ruining the lacquer on the walls. I really learned a lot whilst going to this fabulous place, and you can too."
"An amazing space - really large - most of which is outside and quite a challenge with younger kids in the heat. Having a guide helps!

Pretty busy but not as busy as Hanoi or Ha Long."
"I reccomend planning about 2-3 hours here, there is a lot to look at and alot of good info to learn about but it all boils down to a similar theme to be honest.

That being said it is all very interesting and an essential part of Hue and Vietnam.

Enjoy but don't spend a whole day here like some reviews suggest."
"Spent 4 hours here as there is so much to see! The place is huge and has a few shops inside for snacks, drinks plus the gifts.
A lot of people had tour guides but unfortunately we never got one due to being on a budget. You can learn a lot from the information boards but you get detailed knowledge from the tour guides. It's 150,000dong. Roughly £5 and it's totally worth the visit."
Disappointing. Although it is worth a look if you havent seen Chinese architecture previously. The whole place needs to be restored.
"The Citadel sits across the Perfume River from the major market area of Hue. The tower and massive Vietnamese flag are visible from most of Hue, even on an overcast day. The UNESCO site once served as the seat of government for the Nguyen Dynasty, serving as the fortified home of the emperor.

There is quite a bit to see once you cross the small river (moat?) that surrounds the outer fortification. This moat is drawn from the nearby Perfume River by the use of sluice gates. The Citadel is no small fortress. The outer walls cover a two kilometer square area. We gathered at a small monument with several large cannons before crossing the moat and passing through the massive stone archway.

There are plenty of things to see once you enter the Citadel, to include an abundance of Temples. The central feature is the Purple Forbidden City, which, like its Chinese counterpart, was reserved for the imperial family. We navigated through the Imperial City and Purple Forbidden City with our guide, who imparted quite a bit of history on our tour. Having grown up at the tail end of the Vietnam era, and having served in the Marine Corps just a few years after that war ended, I was very familiar with the battle that happened in Hue. The pockmarked walls were a constant reminder of that conflict as we learned the history of the 13 Emperors who resided here.

This history is rich. We learned that the first emperor didn't like western women because they had ugly teeth (Vietnamese women dyed their teeth black, which was more to his liking. The second emperor was a playboy. The fourth emperor was the younger son, which created chaos...he was also impotent, leaving no heir. His adopted son ruled for three days, was deposed and replaced with his own son. And so on through the twelfth emperor, who built the gaudiest tomb in Vietnam and whose own son was believed to be fathered by someone else. The last emperor abdicated.

The grounds are not perfectly maintained and the damage of weather and wars are visible everywhere. From the war damaged walls to the ornate temples whose mosaic tiles are time worn, it is evident that the Citadel has seen better days. But there are restoration projects under way. So visitors currently can see both the damaged parts of the citadel as well as getting a perspective of what this magnificent fortress once looked like.

It is definitely worth the time to visit. You can spend an entire day here if you wanted to, particularly with a guide to explain to you what you are seeing. We spent half a day with our guide and only saw the highlights."
"Without a tour guide the Citadel is difficult to appreciate. There aren't many signs in English to give foreign tourists information. The grounds themselves were a little overgrown and several buildings were under renovation. Also, the entrance ticket was 150,000 dong per person, which seemed a bit much for what it was."
"150,000VND per person (30,000VND for children) grants access to this incredible place. A visit to Hué wouldn't be complete without a visit here. In my opinion, it is the main attraction. The Imperial Citadel in Hanoi doesn't even compare to its bigger brother in Hué!

A vast site that requires a lot of time. At least half a day would probably suffice. Any less and you'd be really pushing it for time. It's all flat but does require a lot of walking between buildings. There are steps here and there, however.

I strongly advise that you get a map from the internet and screenshot it to your phone before you go. A visit in an ANTI-CLOCKWISE direction (after going straight ahead to the central area) is probably the best route in order to take-in the whole site without retracing steps. Take a backpack with some bottled water. There is a very reasonable cafe on site but it serves pretty basic things. There are free toilets too."
"You enter the citadel through the main gate, and to start with it feels like a regular tourist attraction, plenty of people, lovely buildings, etc.... BUT the real beauty of this place comes as you start to explore ... don't take the electric carts (unless of course you have to) but just start to wander... and you will be rewarded, for round every corner lies a gorgeous building or a lovely pool with reflections just wanting to be photographed ... walk the paths and you will miss it.

You kind of forget the horns and mots whizzing by whilst you meander...."
"Spent four hours enjoying the Citadel and museum and we were not ready to leave when it was time to go. So many nooks and crannies to explore with a great job being done on ongoing restorations. How anyone can do this justice in an hour as part of a day tour is beyond me. Do yourself a favour and allow several hours to really immerse yourself. And don't miss the antiquities museum outside, included in the price and tons of fascinating pieces from the past couple of centuries."
"This place is huge. Allow at least a day- even though you could spend a week , one day will be enough as it all gets a little of the same same.It is a work in progress and the effort that is being spent to restore this is nothing short of amazing. Most areas consist of intricate tiling with intricate patterns which workers are painstakingly doing by hand. So much has already been done but from what I can see it will take years and years to complete. The info tablets positioned around the extensive grounds paint a realistic picture of by gone days ."
"The Citadel is the main historical landmark in Hue and should be at the top of your to do list. We visited on a day tour from Hoi An.There is so much to see like the Imperial City, the Forbidden Purple City and the Emperor's Private Residence. The setting amd buildings are all stunning. Don't forget your camera."
They have done a lot of work here. 10 years ago it was a little more rustic and I can't say that all the new buildings have added more appeal. It was very real and you thought about how it in would have looked in years past. Now they have built buildings in the old style and it is still impressive but it is to me more touristy than before. It had elephants in the grounds and you could walk around this really big area which gave you a sense of how big it was and now you can't do that. So even though it is still worth seeing I was disappointed.
"Worth visiting to learn more about Hue's ancient and more recent history, although it was a little disappointing to learn just how much of the site had been (or will soon be) totally restored - there's not much of the original buildings left."
"is interesting to know that the imperial city was that unique.
how they have built it..the feng shui
worth to visit.."
"After reading great reviews of the place I was bitterly disappointed walking in. For a heritage listed place it seems that the locals have let it fall into disrepair and are not taking enough care to keep it the way it is or restore it is some of its former glory. The information contained in the portraits hanging is limited and you need to know history about imperial Vietnam before entering. The entry price of 150.000VND is well over priced. Is the place a must see? Maybe because you are in the town of Hue, but if you dont come to Hue, I wouldn't go out of my way to see it."
We visited here last year & We did enjoy a lot. It's the history site for who want to know about Nguyen's Dynasty.
"We were in time to see the changing of the guards happens only once a day., pipe blowing drums banging very good. Lot of it was demolished during the 1970s war but they have plans to rebuild it all which will take many years and an awful lot of money. Very interesteing"
"This is in a large citadel complex and carries the most amazing history . Having a guide was really helpful as we lived the story through his words. What a disgrace that the Americans bombed such an historical worthy place of high religious significance . There is so much to see and a lot of walking to see everything.
Throughly enjoyed this experience and would strongly recommend this a place to visit. Easy to walk to from the main street in Hue by crossing the bridge opposite Saigon Morin hotel and turning left - you cannot miss it."
"A bit over priced for what you get.
It's cool yes but I feel you should be paying more like 50 k at most for it."
Quite and relaxing atmosphere inside the old citadel. Great views for photography. You can spend half of your day there walking and imagine how the ancient king was leaving.
One of the best culture things to do in Vietnam. You learn a lot about the kings and how Vietnam over the years. The place and the tombs are in a good shape and amazing in the detail that the people put in to them. Easiest way to do all in one day is by scooter. Ticket for all 4 places costs 360000 dong only the place 150000
"Interesting place to walk around. I almost didn't go but glad I did. It took 2-3 hours and I enjoyed the quietness. Except (in spots) the loudest cicada bugs I've ever heard- that was fascinating on its own (not complaining).
I climbed around on top of the entrance towers which was fun and got good city views. This is before and after the ticket entrance so you don't have to have tickets for this or if you just want to walk around the avenues and moats on the outside."
The Citadel is a vast compound of the Royal family from days gone by. Lots of beautiful buildings to see that are not congruent with the bleak fortified walls that were built around it by the French. The grounds and the temples were lovely. The throne room with it's teak pillars was impressive. A must see when visiting Hue.
The history of Hue and Nyugen Dynasty really come into focus as one tours the Citadel and the Forbidden Purple City. If you like history and architecture you will want to see this.
"We had our own guide and she really explained every detail about the Ngoyen dynasty, the last Emperors and their hundreds of concubines and hundreds of children and thousands of servants living in the forbidden city part of the citadel. Pity the French forces destroyed most of it"
One of the must-see places once you plan to Hue. The citadel itself is huge with many ancient artifacts. There are enough instruction in few foreign languages but you do need a professional guide if you are keen on understanding everything.
"This was actually of the highlight of our visit to Imperial City. It is a beautiful space with intricate details. The grounds are quite large, so be prepared to spend a bit of time there. It has a very imposing entrance with lots to see inside. Amazing building and gardens. You can see scrumb sections of the inner walls riddled with bullet holes. Beautiful architecture and interesting history in contained location."
"Stunned by the size of the grounds of the Imperial City. It takes some imagination to envision the full glory as the buildings/grounds are still a work in progress in terms of restoration. But well worth a visit. Take a guided tour (inexpensive for one hour of history, your way). Walk the main grounds and then after you exit, take another ""tour"" with one of the bicycle rickshaws. Our driver was quite chatty and happy to make a diversion or stop if we saw something we found interesting."
"The Imperial City was apparently pretty well damaged during the war and due to weather and has only partially been restored. The area is large and it was helpful that we had a guide to explain the highlights to us. It also helped that we were there when there were not a lot of crowds, even if the weather was a bit cool."
Great place to visit to learn more about the history of Vietnam. The best way is to come here as early as you can since it can get really hot after 11am. Don't forget to use a guide. It's worth it.
"This place is huge. The grounds are really extensive, lots of buildings so recommend going with a tour company. If you go on your own, be sure to bring your own information to read as there is not much in way of posted descriptions. Also comfortable shoes, be prepared to walk a lot, but it is all very easy and flat. One can only begin to imagine how spectacular it must have been when people actually lived here."
"There are so many facets to this historical site. You could spend a day here no trouble. To go though buildings and walk on paths that people were using so long ago. Everything is of huge proportions, including the moat. Words can't do it justice, it has to be seen to be believed."
This is the main site in Hue and it is a great piece of history and culture. The buildings need a lot of renovation to really bring them back to how they used to be and the information was a bit all over the place and uninspiring.
"We, family of four, parents and two high-school age daughters, had a great day visiting the Citadel. Enjoyed the history, the buildings and a live musical performance."
Big place with lots of ground to cover. We hit the highlights reading small English descriptions where available. We were in town for new moon. Lots of extra locals and girls in traditional dress which was neat.
"Fascinating visit to the Citadel, insight into the history of the last dynasty. Sympathetic restoration following the ravages of war and weather during the last century. Worth a visit."
"I went here on my own, without guide. Large grounds with lots of different and very beautiful houses. It is hard to get a good overview and there are not many signs showing you where to go or what is significant. Some of the signs are illegible due to wear and tear from weather. It is probably worth hiring a guide just to get more backstory.
Much was destroyed in the war but that in itself is worth seeing, and remembering. The entrance fee may seem somewhat steep at 150k dong, but worth it."
Great visit here. Loads to see. Go with a guide to explain everything. Take a hat !! Well worth a visit
I don't think I would buy the ticket again if I were to re-do my trip to Hue. I would rather have spent my money on the tombs instead. Its pretty but not worth it in my opinion (since I'm a budget traveller).
This is a must do whilst in Hue. Incredible place with so much history. It's a pity so much was destroyed in the war but why is left is staggering
"Very large complex, only partially restored after the war, possibly not always phylologically.
A very nice place, if not crowded.
To be enjoyed, it requires a knowledgeable guide"
"To start with this place is Huge. It's like walking inside a 13th century city. The ticket for foreigners were on the expensive side at 150,000 VND for a unguided tour. Definitely not backpacker friendly. There aren't a lot of things to see inside except for the ruins and old stuffs. To walk all over this citadel you need atleast 2 hours in hand. The place is soulful. There is a museum inside which does have some unique artifacts and pottery collection. It was a good place but definitely overpriced for foreigners. The place was extremely slippery when it was raining and many people were falling down in floor. But then that's the fun."
I really enjoyed our tour of Hue Imperial City although it was cloudy and drizzly. Beautiful grounds and the original residence was something to behold.
"There are a history treasure of Vietnam for 200 year with 13 King Dynasty. Highly recommend for everyone would learn about Vietnamese History and cultural. A huge resident palace which its size more than 10ha make you so curious about millions of stories of 13 kings of Vietnam.
Would highly recommend ! Will visit again with my family members again."
"This wonderful ancient capitol is extensive and impressive. Such a strange combination of all that was a magnificent kingdom with the flag of the new Vietnam flying high. A good guide will make this an enhanced experience--stories of the imperial family and the days before the capital moved to Hanoi. A lot of interesting photographs, artifacts and the still-standing buildings are wonderful to explore. There is a great deal of restoration underway, which will only make it a more exciting experience."
"This was the most outstanding cultural site of our 16 day trip around all major centers of Vietnam. it is a large, impressive complex, especially for a small country. It has good exhibition of artifacts. I was glad to see that substantial restoration has taken place since the war."
We spended here half day and it was very nice! This place is very clean and calm. Definitely recommened ! :-) it isnt possible to entry from another entry part of citadel - only from main entry where you can buy a ticket.
"This is a nice option for a half day trip. There's lots of walking involved if you want to get around all there is to see. Most of the structures and gardens are in a state of disrepair. Some have been bombed out completely. This history here doesn't go back too far. I've lived in homes that were built before this palace. There was nothing here that made me say ""wow."""
We enjoyed our tour of the Imperial City (the Citadel). It is beautiful and so impressive. Do not miss it!
"Massive complex in the heart of the city with a mix of fortifications and palace buildings. While some areas were destroyed with the bombings, there are enough still standing/been renovated to get a real feel of the place. Well worth a visit to understand the life of the Emperors"
"Very interesting how this was built in the same manner of the Imperial City in Beijing. Hardly anyone here, and much renovation needs to be done. Be sure to see the reading room and the theater."
"Took a tour of The Citadel which was very good and interesting, well worth a look. The guide was excellent"
This complex is indeed large. You can spend a good amount of time wandering around these spacious grounds. I appreciated the photographs depicting what life was like for the ruling class. Buildings are being refurbished but that does not take away from the enjoyment of the other rooms and grounds.
"We visited the Imperial City and were very disappointed. Within the walls it is mainly ruins and very little information. We stayed around an hour and that was dragging it out.

Wouldn't recommend."
"Very impressive to see although great a map somewhere as this isn't something that's offered in the place. The one on the back of your ticket doesn't read well!!
A must in hue!!"
"Hue imperial city is really the place to visit when in Hue, amazing and interesting to see, especially with the good tour guide like we had (Hang :)"
"I wasn't quite sure what to expect and the citadel is truly enormous. You walk through one part, then find another and another. We visited late morning and it was quite quiet. I liked the photographs which showed what live was like . Our guide described life there with concubines and servants who became literally prisoners in this immense palace. The gardens were lovely and there is restoration taking place but I'm never sure it isn't better to leave things as they are."
A very interesting place to visit and learn about the history. There is restoration work still going on.
"I joined a wonderful small full day city tour of Hue with freelance guide Hoa, who was so friendly and knowledgeable :)"
"We visited in the morning and we're glad to do so, because on our way to the exit at 10am one big queue of people walked slowly through the side. In Summer it is exhaustingly hot, bring enough water.
The photographs of the emperors time were impressive and gave an good idea of this time."
"The palace is quite amazing! To spend a day walking its quiet and beautiful grounds is fulfilling and tranquil. Its best to avoid the super hot days though. There are two coffeeshops located in the palace, one in the garden and the other behind the throne room."
"We visited the Imperial City on the wettest day! But it was still a great visit. I would love to go back in the sunshine one day. As it's such a large site, be prepared for a walk, though the underfoot terrain is not a problem. It feels solemn but also intimate and it was very interesting to find out about the Nguyen dynasty. As with so many historical sites in Vietnam this was badly damaged in the Vietnam War, but is being slowly restored and there is still plenty to see."
We visited Hue's Imperial enclosure with two kids aged 5 and 7 and ended up spending around 5 hours in there. In spite of a few complaints about the long walks the kids - as well as ourselves - had a great day exploring the huge enclosure where there is so much to see. There are a few places inside the enclosure where you can buy something for lunch.
"We spend a long time here taking a gander at all the structures, gardens and perusing things. We didn't have a guide however had our visit books and handouts from the inn and felt learned. It regards see that they are reestablishing it and attempting to safeguard it for what's to come."
Again most was distroyed in the war and slowly being rebuilt. Just the history of this place is impressive and how people cut themselves off from their families to work for emperor but in return the poor family got money. Leave a few hours if you want a really good look around this place.
"So glad we did it this way. A ticket for 4 sites (Imperial City + 3 tombs) cost 360k p.p. Each tomb is 100k & the Imperial City is more, so you save a bit by getting the multi ticket. But BEWARE, it is only valid for the day you buy & the next day for one visit to each site. The Imperial City, surrounded by the high-walled citadel is a massive complex of gates, gardens, royal residences & places of worship. We did not hear of any tour that allows you to fully appreciate all the different areas. Most will only show you the highlights in an hour or so. Well worth taking the time to immerse yourself in the wonder of this place. We did a Hué city tour next day that included the tombs & Thien Mu Pagoda. This was good as the tombs are a bit widespread. The pagoda was surprisingly impressive but I did not feel that the tombs offered a great deal more to the experience of the Imperial City, although there was some different & interesting architecture. (And of course a different history) Overall, if you're time-poor, at least don't miss the Imperial City - you should get a good enough dose in half a day."
Must see. Thus place is a must. To understand the thinking of the people and the power of the King as well as the life inside a palace.
"This was damaged during the war, but there is still a lot to see. I recommend taking an hour or so to walk through it."
Hue is a very mediocre city to visit in Vietnam. The Citadel can also be described as mediocre. Dont go with high expectations or just skip it completely.
"We spent five hours in the citadel and explored everything thoroughly. However, we took a long time to find the gardens but they're worth finding. The NLF took over the citadel during the Tet Offensive in 1968 and to dislodge them a lot of buildings were destroyed. (In order to save the village we had to destroy it sounds familiar). I would have liked to visit before this happened."
"Maybe that's spectacular to western people, it's not that interesting to a Hongkongese. It's just a small palace you could find in any ancient Chinese capital."
I admit that I was totally caught by surprise at the size of this place. I did not expect it to be so big. This is a must visit site. It's size is smaller than the Forbidden City in Beijing but still very big.
"Unique craftsmanship of Vietnamese culture presented in an once prestigious location. Restoration works was in progress over the years and many structures can now be admired and imagined how it was once were living quarters for the Royals.

Almost Chinese but uniquely Vietnamese motifs and writing are found everywhere. Nostalgic photos on display to help visitors relate on how these buildings were occupied by the royalties and how they conducted their lives.

Intricate and lavished crafts were presented on building roofs, doors and altar tables. This absolutely worth a trip a few more times. Behind the citadels are the various tombs belonging to a few emperors. To cover all tombs required a couple of days. Be sure to make time for it if you like to do that."
"Had to go and after hearing stories of other semi-elderly tourists and their fatigue and signage issues we hired a private guide to put a tour together including a boat trip to the Thien Pagoda, taxi to a lunch spot and then the Citadel. Still wore us out, but the history was explained most clearly and we saw so much of the wonderful architecture that we were very pleased."
Situated on a large site it's well worth spending plenty of time here. Not as opulent as some places we have visited but the scale and the history of the place is extremely impressive and well worth a visit. We were lucky to have a very informative guide.
"We went to Hue Imperial City 2 weeks ago. Nice place with beautiful library and imposant Citadel. If you plan to visit more sightseeing I recommend you to buy combine ticket, you will save your money."
"We spent a morning walking through the imperial city. A lot of restoration work has been done and still needs doing to recreate fully what this would have looked like. Plenty of interesting and attractive buildings/gates etc. Worth noting that this place is huge. If it's a very hot day, walking round will be tiring so bring plenty of water."
"This place is huge, and well worth a few hours to explore. There are a mixture of ruins and beautiful restored buildings, along with some nice garden areas. I suggest going earlier rather than later to avoid crowds, but the area is big enough that you can usually find some less crowded feature to explore.

The day I visited I was delayed by a visit from the Emperor of Japan, but the mood was festive while we waited for the citadel to re-open. Parking was at a premium, but there was a motorcycle lot a couple hundred meters/yards from the entrance."
"when you visit old citadel, you shoud by ticket about 150000d, but you can by combo ticket for 3 or 4 places to save money for you"
"The Citadel is filled with history and so much beauty, the buildings are breathtaking and the gardens lovely."
"All about the emperors who lived here, its also very large, 2 or 3 hours on a tour. They could really improve the information flow for tourists, not enough signs or maps showing layout when it was thriving so its difficult to visualise as so much ground to cover.
Without a guide or book won't get the most out of your trip."
"This place is so huge, I would recommend either hiring a guide or finding a good written guide and planning ahead. It is very easy to just wander around not really knowing what you are seeing. Quite interesting and was within walking distance of our hotel. Well worth seeing!"
"It's a peaceful place to wander around the ruins but if I'm honest, nothing special. Sure it was fabulous before the war... It will be great when it's fully restored. Overpriced ticket at 150k VND per adult but I guess that pays for the restoration. Worth a look - make sure you walk beyond the 30 feet the tourist groups occupy. It's huge."
There is a lot to see so take your time to really enjoy the citadel. Very good English information about the emperors who lived here but nothing about the vast battle during the war so read up about this before you visit.
"The imperial city was part of a guided tour by scooter. Our enlish speaking guide + 2 scooter drivers. We visited the market in Hué, the grandchild (82 years old) of a Mandarin, a traditional hat maker and finally the imperial city. I highly recommend to take a guide beacuse there are so many details that you could miss. every stone, every colour, every piece of decoration has a specific meaning and is important to understand in dive into the vietnamese culture."
"A large complex, & a very relaxing few hours wandering round.
150,000d to get in (£5-6) & lots to see.
Many of the outer buildings destroyed by bombing, but the remainder still have lots of amtosphere & dripping with history.
Surprisingly not too busy either (though we went at 10am), & lots of different photo opps too.
Well worth a visit"
"Large walled compound that was the home of the Nguyen dynasty. Restored after the American war it encompasses the Royal Palace and a small assortment of other buildings, The entrance and grounds have beautiful landscaping, Recommend, Hope this helps."
We spent over 2hrs here. Really enjoyed all the ancient history. Lovely and peaceful to walk around. A must visit if in Hue.
"If there is no time to visit many of the sites in Hue, make sure not to miss the Citadel. It was built in 1804 by Emperor Gia Long. It was partly destroyed during the American war, but is now slowly being restored."
The Citadel is a beautiful historic location. the park grounds are lovely. Great opportunity for lovely photos of restored architecture. Our guide was knowledgeable and answered many questions so we could really appreciate the importance of the Citadel in Vietnamese history and culture. Highly recommended
Amazing place to visit!!! We spent 2 and a half hours walking around gob smacked at the shear vastness of the place
"We were not expecting much as we had heard it was heavily damaged in the war but was pleasantly surprised. Make sure you get off the main path as the gems are off to the sides especially the south western corner (if the main gate is considered the south entrance).
Of course it doesn't compare to the Forbidden City or Angkor Wat but then we didn't expect it to.
We spent about 3 hours walking around and there was plenty of information at the major stops."
Had the afternoon. To kill following the bus ride up from hoi an. Made a point to go here. Found myself in a dragon boat. Cost 5 bucks. Didn't feel like haggling people whose boat is also their home. Citadel was a good walk about. Get a tour guide. History always fun to listen too while also seeing the sights. Was a fine way to pass a few hrs.
This is a must see in Vietnam and in particular if in Hue. Make sure you use an English speaking local guide so you get a full appreciation of the culture and history of this place and Vietnam in general.
"The whole area is like a nice park but it is honestly a bit boring. Of course the citadel had hard time during the last centuries especially the American War and only a small portion of it remained intact or has been renovated.

There are quite a few photos and texts but usually they are the opposite of interesting. I expected more stories from a 143 years dinasty during which the country became French colony.

Anyway it could be visited if you are in Hue and you have a few hours spare time."
"The Citadel is a photographers paradise. The restored buildings, the gardens, even the tea house are eye candy begging to be recorded. I planned my tour with my guide in the early morning to avoid the afternoon heat. Do not miss this historical site."
"Many people are complaining about paying 150k to get in. We bought the 2-day pass with 3 attractions, which meant that we could go to the imperial city and 2 of the tombs for 280k. The main gate and the canal outside is wonderful. When you get in, you have the main building with the emperors throne and the building is in a really nice condition. The rest of the imperial city is a combination of ruins and damaged buildings, some under renovation and reconstruction. I was a bit disappointed that a huge part of the forbidden city was gone, but the ruins created a special atmosphere. We walked about the entire imperial city, walked through the lovely gardens and explored all of the remaining buildings and wonderful corridors."
"This is one of Vietnams 7 UNESCO world Heritage Sites. We had a guide but unfortunately English was her third language and French her 2nd ....
We had a good idea of which areas we wanted to see In this ancient city which is laid out in a perfect square, which has a 10 kilometres wall around it and a moat.
There was no need to see everything so it was just The Citadel, The Palace and at the back of the Palace the Forbidden Purple City.... A which all took a few hours to get around.
It's worthwhile reading up on the history of this special area."
We spent the better part of a morning touring this complex. We were really glad that we had a guide with us as she was able to give us great amounts of information.
"This is of course a must see in Hue.
Unfortunately our guide was not very good and his english was really poor but you don't really need a guide. You can visit this site on your own without any problems."
"If youre a history buff this place is cool. However, it sprawls out and takes most of the day walking in the heat to visit all the sites. Mostly architecture and living areas, not much in terms of dress, weaponry, and international influence. The steep price brings it down to a three for me. Not quite worth that much."
"The Citadel is an impressive place to visit. With its large footprint, the Citadel is a reminder of historical times, when fortresses and grandeur went hand in hand. While it has seen better days, and with sections damaged by bombing, the complex is still good to view. Learning about the leaders, their families and the mandarins is important in understanding Vietnamese history."
"Do not do what we did. We wanted a guide so that we would learn more about the site and not be rushed through on a group tour. So we hired one of the guides just outside the entrance gate to the right. One of the ladies in the pretty Vietnamese colorful dress pants outfits. What a disappointment. It was1500 doing and she rushed us through everything, showing us less than half the sites, talking to her friends and on the phone. One hour and she was done. A waste. I'm guessing there must be another way to get a knowledgeable guide that will not rush you. It may cost more but if you are interested it would be we worth it.

The site is very interesting but without understanding what you are seeing it loses some of its meaning. Still we enjoyed it and would highly recommend it"
The imperial palace is one of the main attractions in Hue but if you have the chance to visit the tombs around the city you will you will have the chance to experience more authentic places hidden in the forest.
"Not everything is restored yet, but you really feel like going back in time when you are inside. You will need at least 3 hours to see all buildings and gardens, but if you take your time you can walk here for a day.

Entrance fee Feb 2017: 150.000 dong"
"it is the main attraction of Hue; beautifull gardens, many buildings have been restored and a lesson of ancient and modern history"
Visited this incredible historical site as part of a small group tour today. Absolutely loved it. Definitely better with a guide who can share the history with you. Leave plenty of time
"I have visited the HUE IMPERIAL CITADEL previously but this time went with a guide from BeeBee Travel and it made all the difference. Ted was a fantastic guide, a wealth of information who made the tour entertaining as well as informative. We finished at the MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES which most people miss. It is well worth a visit but if you really want to appreciate it get a guide from BeeBee Travel or huefreetour.com"
"Probably not much more to be said on this than other reviews. Does get very hot and parts wide in the open so dress appropriately, bring water and put sunscreen on."
"This is an interesting place to see. From the outside, it has the feel of a moated walled citadel enclosing a royal palace -- somewhat like a smaller version of the Forbidden City in Beijing. The layout (both outside around the moat, and inside the walls) looks a bit like Beijing too, with broad avenues turning in 90-degree angles. It is sad to see that historical events had let the place down. Many houses within the palace are gone, replaced by grass --- not sure whether out of neglect during the French colonial era or out of shelling & bombings during the American war. So the visitor does see quite a bit of wide open space within the walls.

But in terms of the buildings which remain (and there are a few mostly clustered in the southern end of the complex ; there are new builds which the custodians or others may have built up to serve as offices on other spots) they are very impressive. Somewhat different from Beijing, there is a noticeable European influence to the palace. One hall, for instance, had flooring which looked very much like the Portuguese blue-and-white (azulejo) tiles one would see half-way across the world. (See picture.) In other areas, there is a direct parallel to the Chinese imperial model -- down to the shape of the dragons on the roof of the main throne hall, something which Chinese emperors of old would not have looked kindly upon (what?!? the Vietnamese tributary is using a design exclusively reserved for the Middle Kingdom?!? how presumptuous of them...).

The present-day palace exhibitors had also put up photographs of costumed mandarins ostensibly from the time of the the Nguyen dynasty (2/3 of which was spent increasingly under the thumb of the French), and if the captions didn't say these were from the Nguyen dynasty, the visitor may have justifiably mistaken the costume as Chinese period costumes from the Ming and Song dynasties several centuries earlier. (By the time of the Nguyen in Vietnam, China itself had long come under the control of the Manchus and had enforced the shaved foreheads and pigtails on almost all the men.) Some of these exhibits would have been good for history-minded visitors.

Visitors who want to play costumed role-play can also dress up as the emperor and sit on a (not the real one) throne in a side chamber to the (real) throne hall. If memory serves, it was around 150,000 VND to dress up and it's closer to 200,000 VND to dress up plus have 2 servants around you. There was a price-list put up somewhere... Kids or the young-at-heart may enjoy this stuff. For visitors not inclined to role-play, there is a gift store also selling canned beverage & ice cream next to the imitation throne role-play chamber. They have seats there too for visitors who want to sit down and eat or drink.

Note that entry is from the south gate, and exit is from the east gate."
"What an amazing place. You could easily spend a day here looking around and reading all the information on offer. Even though it's a tourist spot because of it's size, you don't really get any crowds of people."
the Hue imperial city is amazing. a must see if you are in Hue City. the history is breathtaking the traditional musicians were wonderful.
"Would love to see this when it is finally restored but it is well worth a half day's viewing. We had a guide and it really made a difference as we got a lot of the story as we meandered along. It is a huge place and takes time. Why anyone would want to bomb it is beyond comprehension. It portrays another era, like a fairy tale."
"Joined a day tour with VM Travel. The guide is very knowledgeable and have passion to guide us along the whole trip. With the explanation and information provided by the guide, i found the palace is much more interesting."
"Only the massive walls are original, most buildings do not exist anymore, one has been reconstructed after the war. Animation on a large TV screen show what once was there."
"We stayed about twenty minutes walk away on the opposite side of the water, so a few hairy moments crossing traffic and we were inside the Ancient Town for the price you get so much for your money, we started by walking one half of the perimeter wall, through the centre and then the other perimeter wall to the exit. We took our time investigating various gardens with barely another tourist or even an organized tour in sight, exploring the various courtyards which detailed the history of the citadel in several languages. There are plenty of places to sit and rest, snack shops and also toilet facilities, kept in a clean condition. I would highly recommend a visit and frankly you haven't experienced Hue without a visit, excellent value for money."
"We spend quite a while here looking at all the buildings, gardens and reading things. We didn't have a guide but had our tour books and leaflets from the hotel and felt knowledgeable. It is good to see that they are restoring it and trying to preserve it for the future."
Visiting the Citadel and Imperial City was like stepping back in time. A great place to just walk and explore for a few hours.
"We did this a bit rushed the morning before we checked out of our hotel, but I was very glad we did. Would have been a real shame to miss this. Enjoyed walking around the complex at our own pace, very large area. Found it interesting, beautiful and relaxing (even when strapped for time!), although would likely have gotten more out of it with a guide. This site was involved with the Vietnam War, so many parts were destroyed, but that unfortunate fact also adds to its history. It is of course hot here but there are many buildings to go into for shade."
"This imperial city is nice to visit, but make sure the weather is good. We went while it was raining, and while it was certainly interesting, the experience would have been much more enjoyable if we could enjoy the gardens in the sunshine."
"Admittedly, I didn't pay...I accidentally entered via the exit gate I found out at the end but, I would have been disappointed if I had. Yes, some lovely buildings etc etc but, not very good upkeep which is a shame. Plus the gardens have been let go a bit too. Nice to walk around it's surrounding streets though and the park on the way there"
"Amazing to learn that Vietnam's emporer sat in his own secluded city till 1945!
Sad that so little is left but still interesting to see.

Ok to see in 1-1 1/2 hour - there were some good old photos with English text about the royal family from late 1800 to 1930ies but may be worthwhile to hire a guide..

Buy a combination ticket to see also 2 tombs - 280.000 Dong instead of 350.000 :-)"
"This complex is huge and 3 hours wasn't time to do it justice even with a guide.
There are many building missing due to various wars.It is a wonderful place to realise the extent of the Emperor's life all those years ago. I was amazed at the huge bronze cauldrons. There is so much to see in regard to antique furniture. The ancient living conditions of the royal families indicated how privileged they were in regard to how their subjects survived. Well worth the effort on a warm day"
Had a great day wandering round all of the buildings and ruins in the Citadel. Great for a chilled day away from all of the madness. A must see in Hue.
this was part of the multiple stop day tour of hue. generally very interesting place to visit. nice grounds. would have preferred longer to wander around (2-3 hrs would have been great). photographs hung around are fantastic.
"An easy walk from the Century Riverside Hotel to The Citadel which was interesting and great to see street life as you walked down the road.
The Citadel is amazing steeped in history and Vietnamese culture with ongoing restoration which doesn't distract the casual visitor.
Great photographic opportunities to take unique photo images.
Well worth the visit to this iconic location."
"If you like old building, you will love this place. It was a little expencive, but the palace is huge and you can spend all day there."
"We attended here with a guide and unfortunately, due to the group's size, were not able to spend more time here. This is a worthwhile stop and is the highlight of Hue.

The history of the building of the citadel and the history surrounding the site that followed including the Tet Offensive certainly make this an interesting visit."
"Great site to visit, and not to be missed while in Hue. Tremendous history here - something for everyone ranging from the more recent military siege and assault to the days of the monarchy and its royal lineage"
We spent the afternoon here and were not disappointed. It wasn't overrun with tourists like some of the other sites we visited. You still couldn't avoid bumping into the obligatory obnoxious Chinese tour groups but you could still find remote corners to enjoy the site in peace.
We had a great tour guide with a witty sense of humor. Offered great insights into the history of the city and the palace.
"The buildings and layout are great and what you kind of expect after visiting some other sites in Hue, but once inside the gates it looks very grand. You definitely need a tour guide so you don't miss out on anything and make sure you hear all the info u need."
"We visited the Citadel with great expectations. It is very large, with a good collection of black n white photos of their kings and society hundreds of years ago.
We were most disappointed to see a flat empty open space where the Forbidden City once stood - bombed and destroyed completely during the war. Much of the rest of the imperial complex had also been similarly destroyed. Restoration work had recreated some spaces but much more needs to be done.
With a good guide, we were able to appreciate the highlights of its history."
"The Imperial City in Hue is a gigantic set of buildings in varying states of repair following hundreds of years of neglect and a lengthy war.
There is much to see here and a lot of walking so better to start early in the day (the place closes early, too).
Far too much to talk about here but good sights and worth seeing."
"We had Mr We take us the short ride to the Citadel and on a sunny hot day had an interesting tour of the old Purple forbidden city. After its destruction during the Vietnam War it is a slow process putting it back together, much progress has been made."
The outside seems most impressive as a lot of the internal buildings such as the forbidden city are long gone.
"Essential visit for history buffs. Impressive place well preserved. Great photo opportunities not too much walking.

Go early or late to avoid the crowds.

Allow 2 hours max."
The Citadel is the most visited place in Hue. It needs a few hours to see the citadel. Lots of walking around needed to see all the places inside.
"The Citadel, containing the Imperial City and within it the Forbidden City, reminds me of its analogue in Beijing. Sadly much of the Hue Imperial City was destroyed during the War, although a few main buildings were preserved and the rest of the City is being restored and the restoration work is excellent. I consider this a ""must-see"" in Vietnam. It is hard to imagine one of the Emperors had 500 concubines and fathered 104 children."
"The Citadel gives an overview of the history of Vietnam (prior to the French), seeing the tombs/monuments of several emperors. It also gives you a sense of how the royal families lived. The gardens are beautiful as are the pagodas. It is huge - very impressive!"
"No trip to Hue would be complete without a visit to the Citadel. Although many of the buildings have been destroyed in past wars, the sites where others once were, provides an enjoyable combination of large open spaces and long tree lined avenues interspaced with various buildings and koi carp filled lakes and moats. The citadel covers a large area so despite being a major tourist attraction it didn't feel crowded."
"First impressions on arrival are how dark and imposing the walls are.
Inside there are numerous buildings in a very large site, numerous ruins to explore and understand how imposing this Palace must have been so many years ago.
The roof of the large building where the throne is kept is beautiful and inside is impressive but cannot be photographed!! There are some lovely ornamental trees in an oriental style."
Its really quite beautiful. If you take the time to read the signs it is very educational. In hindsight perhaps having a tour guide would've been quite helpful as we opted to go through it on our own. It takes about 2 to 3 hours to go through so plan accordingly.
This has got to be one of the highlights of a Vietnam tour. Work is obviously still going on to renovate this area but even as it stands it is amazing. If time permits buy a ticket which combines the Citadel with the 3 tombs
Needed more time to explore The Citadel. If you are interested in history and culture this is a must see. It is hard to get to the truth about how much was destroyed in the American War but whether it is original or rebuilt it is magnificent. Probably you could spend all day here if you wanted to really check it out.
"This is an enormous complex including several temples, the royal palace and various other structures. Much of it has been severely damaged and is undergoing reconstruction, but you can still get the general idea. The most impressive feature is the outer walls and the moat. The buildings inside somehow seem a little artificial (probably because they have been reconstructed). It's still worth a visit, but somehow I preferred the Tu Duc tomb."
"The weather is Hue is terrible, it is still a very good and beautiful city. Get only green taxi drivers with meters there are a lot of scams. Be careful to the spa I found the ones in trip advisor not very good."
If your in Hue you might as well go. a lot of walking because the place is big. I suggest you have a guide or most of it will make no since. It was mostly destroyed during the Tet offensive in '67 but they are rebuilding.
"It cost 150,000 dong for entry to here and the Royal Palace and museum. It was well worth it there is so much to see. It is very peaceful despite there being quite a few group trips. The architecture is amazing and there are English explanations for everything."
"These are the ruins of the Nguyen Dynasty that ruled 1802 to 1945. We had a guide to explain how they ruled and governed and how they where selected as appose to the eldest entitlement, and eventually made Ho Chi Minh president when the people revolted."
"No doubt this is the highlight of Hue. Very big area with many buildings (or what is left of them...).
The lack of information is appalling inside. For 150,000 dong they don't even give you a map of the area. Get ready to wander around and miss a lot if you are not prepared.
We followed the lonely planet tour but even though it was confusing.
Count at least 2 to 3 hours by yourself or even better join a group with a guide."
"Modern city meets ancient. Worth a look quite extensive, Easy to imagine what an extensive power it used to be."
"Is it worth a trip if you're in Hue - definitely. The £7 admission seems reasonable when there is so much work to be done to bring this World Heritage Site up to scratch. The palace is easily accessible and offers a calming and tranquil couple of hours. The walls and moat were particularly impressive, but I was less impressed by the museum aspects ( maybe that's just me)

Would I make a special trip or diversion to Hue to see it? I don't think so, especially now I've seen it. If I was passing through I'd spend the money and enjoy the sights."
"This place is being renovated and you can learn about the history of Vietnam and its emperors. For the 150.000 VND entrance fee you would expect to get at least a map of the place, since I do not like following a tour guide. Which I guess annoyed me when in a small room and then a group of 50 walks in and you can't breathe. away from those crowds the place was very enjoyable."
"This complex is mostly set outside. It was interesting and gave me a better understanding of the history of Vietnam and it's founders. The gardens were beautiful as is the architecture with ornate arches and beautiful gold inlay in the temples.
We spent an enjoyable 3 hrs wandering the site seeking out little secret gardens and viewpoints. Go through all the doors and up all the steps. Enjoy"
Vast area to explore and beautiful gardens. Enjoyed this area and gave a insight into the history of Vietnam.
"I wish you could upload videos because we recorded security hassling us the whole time we were there because we were white. Constantly asking us for a ""ticket"" when Asian people were free to walk in for free and walk around. 300,000 dong for a couple to go, not worth it at all. Reminded us why Hue is the worst stop in Vietnam. Truly lives up to reminding people why Vietnam is just a terrible place to visit. Good job. A couple good restaurants in town but if your into traveling and being treated right don't go here, in fact, just get out of the country and go to Thailand. Vietnam needs to get its act together for tourism. Only place worse is Russia."
This is THE site to see in Hue... it is an amazing temple complex with greater interest than most. Parts are old and parts are amazingly restored. I highly recommend.
Enjoyed our time viewing the Citadel. It was interesting and gave us an incite into how the emperors lived.
"This is one of the most important places in Vietnam. However , it really needs much clearer historical information for the average tourist. Having being bombed multiple times there were no photos of the before during and after the bombs. Big open sites, now just grass were where the temples and buildings were and it is a pity that there is not more information in a visual way."
"The Seat of the ancient King Emperors of Vietnam, this is an amazing building, damaged like much of Hue in the 1968 TET offensive and now restored to its former glory."
"I would imagine that if you're coming to Hue, one of the main reasons is to see the ancient imperial city, but if that's not the case....CHANGE YOUR PLANS! It would be a BIG mistake to be in Hue and not have spent time within the imperial city.
It's huge and it's awesome with LOTS to see, so give it some of your time while in Hue."
Although a great deal of the site was destroyed by bombing what remains is certainly worth a look the area is pretty and not too crowded when we visited in the afternoon. Be sure to check out the pictures to see how people lived here and to watch the video which explains the layout of the site. There is no information as you walk around so it is good to get a guide to fully understand what you are looking at and to understand the history
"Unimpressed. This is in the top 5 on things to see, that is because there is nothing to see in Hue. There are no signs or maps to show you how to get around...just people walking aimlessly. Save the $7.50 from going inside and get a rickshaw to drive you around the outside. A lot of structures needing repairs as well."
We followed Lonely Planets advice and travelled anticlockwise around this huge site for a good 3hours . Clear directional signs and English explanations at each stop . Wonderful restoration work for future generations to understand something of the splendour of the Nguyen dynasty .
Very interesting and worth a visit if you are in Hue. Really beautiful architecture. Probably worth hiring a guide to give you more information on the site.
"The citadel was nothing what I expected, didn't expect to see a 10,000 metre square fence and moats. It was truly magnificent to see it in its glory on a hot, (sweaty) and sunny day. The forbidden city is located inside as well as all he other quarters. Very cool photo opportunities inside. Worth a visit."
"The Imperial City (citadel) walled city was started in the 1300s and took over 200 years to build. Plan to take a couple hours for an extended walking tour. Not a lot of steps to maneuver. We were with a knowledgeable guide who walked us back in time. Depending on the time of year, it can be quite. Hats and water bottles helped. The photos are so good so check the weather."
Stunning place to visit in Hue and take in the history and culture of this ancient city. The ruins are incredibly well preserved. We went on a very hot day so make sure you have plenty of water as theres nowhere to hide from the sun! A must visit.
Your see evidence of recent war damage but in the main this is a quiet lovely place to visit with an impressive outer wall. Buildings inside and out are well tended and there is a lot to see. Renovation work is being done but does not impinge on the overall attractiveness of the site. I would imagine that during a March visit you would see the numerous heavily scented and stunning frangipani trees in bloom. They were just starting to bloom during late Feb. This is the main 'must see' attraction in Hue
It's a massive place to walk around. Maybe if your interested in history it would be a better expirience but we didn't find it that interesting. Better go first thing in the morning to avoid crowds.
"I was very keen to check out the citadel when we got to hue. I really wasn't blown away by it though unfortunately. There are one or two nice gates but that's about it. Most of it is pretty run down. Some of the temples are well maintained but kind of disappointed. It may just be the day we went though.

There was a little exhibit of a few captured American aircraft and tanks but once again not very well looked after but interesting. If you don't wanna spend 150,000vd per person you won't be missing much."
"A great place to visit and appreciate the history of Vietnam, its cultural evolution and traditions."
"Our guide spoke excellent English and was patient with my too many questions. Expect much walking, and plan to spend an entire day including lunch."
"Spent 2-3 hours exploring the ancient citadel. Really beautiful. It's hard to stop taking photos! Good, informative video near the entrance that gives you some useful knowledge about the site before you proceed. If you visit Hue, you really don't want to miss this place!"
"The imperial city covers a large area and would be far more interesting if there was any kind of information on site. The buildings are well preserved or refurbished and you do get a taste of what it was like in its heyday.
Unless you plan to hire a guide you really need to read up before you go.
Multi lingual audio guides would be very useful."
"This is such a nice peaceful place that got stuck in time one of my favourite places in Hue.

Buy some fish food it's an experience!!"
"The Imperial City was badly damaged in the American/Vietnam war and as a result most of the Imperial City was damaged or even destroyed. Consequently a huge amount of renovation has been and continues to be carried out. It is however easy to visualise the splendour of this once capital of Vietnam.

The Imperial City is huge and comprises of a number of different zones. We were taken around by a guide and he brought the city and its history to life."
Go to this place strictly only if history interests you. The history of the royal family and its 13 kings - which are as of not relevant plus don't seem to have done anything to improve Vietnam. No great contribution except their own family in fightings. Lovely architecture and all made in line with the Vietnamese superstitions and faiths. Parts of it is destroyed by war bombing too. Maintained very well though
"Entrance: 150.000 VDN. Im not quit sure that the price is fair. But you can spend there about 2-3 hours and see a lot of ""old"" buildings and many special trees and flowers. Its like an botanic garden too. We were there today and it was to hot to enjoy it massive, but we did! Take enough water with you and suncream. :D have a good time there."
"150,000vnd. If you can hire a guide it would be a much better experience. Make sure you have enough time. Arrive before 3:00 as it will take some time if you want to see it all."
"The citadel occupies a huge area and is very impressive. We spent a couple of hours there and you could easily spend longer. There is a range of temples, gardens and palaces to see within the walls and moat of the citadel. Some of the citadel is being restored as it was damaged through bombing in the war but there is plenty to see."
"The Citadel can be best described as concentric temples, halls and pagodas built between 1804-1833, lots of it is in ruins, disrepair or being restored. The golden lacquer, red embossed stone pillars, mosaic dragons give some insight into the grandiose it must have been. However it was still quietly impressive and, as it was raining, decidedly empty of tourists for a change! My top spot was Emperors Reading Room, an entire room or house for reading. I have already put it on my list to Santa Claus. Closely followed was nine huge urns that literally could have fit a entire cow in! The only down side to this was the many comical slips, as walking on terracotta tiles, lightly covered in moss is err slippery….."
"As the imperial city of Vietnam, this is a definite must see when in Hue. It is only when you enter the site that you become aware Of the enormity of the complex. A knowledgeable guide is a definite must if you want to benefit fully from a visit. The history is amazing from the start of the construction of the complex to the Tet offensive during the war. Allow yourself at least a couple of hours to soak in the history and the magnitude of the complex."
"The Imperial City in Hue while not as big and preserved as the one in Beijing has the same sense of history, majesty and pure magic. One can imagine how the court operated and power exerted. A visit well worth it - despite the rain; and meeting our neighbours from back home! Small world."
"I asked a private tour guide (Mr. Duyen Nguyen) to Hue. His driver and he picked up my friend and me at the hotel in Da Nang from Hue. He arranged everything including visiting famous places, gorgeous lunch, a boat trip on Perfume River, looking around the city by trikshaw. I also asked to pass High Van Pass on the way to Hue, which offers beautiful scenery. The old capital Hue provides us with many historical interests.
Every building has beautiful decoration on the walls and roofs. We were able to imagine how the emperors lived. The city is worth visiting."
With our guide we discovered this an exceptionally intriguing spot to visit. There is a sensible measure of strolling however you can do (inside reason) to such an extent or little as you prefer. Similarly as with wherever in Vietnam there are some high strides so if versatility is an issue simply be readied.
"I recommend riding a bike there and not pay for a tour because it's a huge place and can get very boring following around a group , we just did it on our own and did it in our own time , very lovely place tho it's amazing and old but it got so hot when we were there !!"
Part of our tour with Mr. Von. Interesting and impressive how big it is/was. Unfortunately about 70% (according to Mr. Von) was destroyed during the Tet offensive. They are slowly rebuilding and restoring but it has a long way to go.
"When we read information about Hue city, the cintadel was appeared in the first page and the photos of this places were everywhere we search for Hue. We know that there will be a big mistake if we traveled to Hue city and not visit this place.
And simply we understand why it is so famous. Because this is really a fantastic place to visit. It reflect all about the history of Dynasty. The royal architecture were amazing ( with the explaination from our tour guide).
Can not missed when visitinng Hue city"
A must visit to understand Vietnamese history and the times during the war! It's a long walk to cover the entire citadel. Just grab a map and walk and read around the citadel!!
"The Imperial City and Citadel is worthy of a visit, because it captures Vietnam's History and reflects the constant change in the last 200 years. For Americans, a visit to Hue revives the headlines of 1968 and teaches lessons (good and bad) about military strategy and urban warfare. But, it is also a beautiful place with ponds and flowers and a gorgeous gate of chipped porcelain. It has a small museum with fascinating old photographs."
"Much of it was destroyed in war and bombing, leaving rubble in many cases, and buildings needing to be restored in other cases. No coherent whole is currently available, and thus I was a bit disappointed with the disjointed or fragmented feel of the place. (By the way, it's a crime it was bombed!) Having said that there's way, way too much information to consume, not presented in any way that's coherent. For example, there are dozens and dozens of photographs hanging, but the pictures could have been presented in such a way that they could have identified key figures for the viewer, and then, build on the info. The place is so huge that even though there are plenty of tour groups there, you usually feel like you can get our space from them. It's tiring to walk the grounds and length of the citadel, so plan accordingly. We went on a moderately warm day with some clouds and a breeze every now and then ... and still it was tiring. A must see? I'm not sure ... but we're here, and what else are we going to do? I did find the tombs more interesting, oddly enough."
"Arrived in Hue after Hanoi overnight train and decided on DIY visit to the Citadel which is in central Hue. You can buy either a one day or two day pass which includes entrance fees to all of the Emperors mausoleums along the banks of the Perfume river. A one day pass cost less than £10 for 2 people. We walked around the central area which has been remarkably well restored. Evidence remains of the Tet Offensive which destroyed the city of Hue in 1968. Work is ongoing to restore more of the Citadel. The whole perimeter is around 10k, not to be completed on a hot day!!! Very impressive historical site."
"We walked here from our hotel which was near walking street and it took about 45 minutes . I think the entrance fee was 150vnd to just see the citadel, you could pay an extra 80vnd to include one of the royal tombs which is situated away from the citadel site. The historic site is spread out but easy walking distance and not too many steps. The only thing I would say is, it would be nice if there was more information about what is on view in English , some photos had explanations in English but buildings and artefacts didn't ---- quite a lot of people had their own guide to explain things---- I sometimes find guides go on a bit too long and I loose interest. We spent a couple of hours wandering around, there are some good photo opportunities especially around the waterways with the huge fish. If you are in Hue then you have to visit the citadel."
"We went on a pouring rainy day , walking and it was well worth it all. We didn't have a guide but we did listen to lots of bits of other guides and we did read it all. We were amazed by the size of the whole plot . What they are doing with the renovations is truly brilliant. The theatre is stunning as is many if the other buildings. We went off piste and found one building that they were doing up and we could see in. The dragons that are normally on the roof were on-the floor and it was great to see the mosaic up close.
Glad we didn't too this as part of a tour as we walked about for nearly 3 hours and on the day tour would have only been given an hour .
When you get your ticket it covers you for two days to see the tombs and the citadel."
You walk along the old city walls and can appreciate what a great and powerful kingdom this must have been. It was once capital of Vietnam. Don't miss the museums just a few blocks away.
It's a must see! its's sad that the US bombed the main palace but still interesting to see what's left of it.....The actual photos of the Royal family that hang on the walls are so interesting too.The palace grounds and old structures are a sight.
"Nice park with good explanations as to how it used to be. Lots of war damage means that the restoration work is gradually trying to get it back there. Needs a bit of imagination, but certainly worth a visit."
This is a must see sight during your visit to Vietnam. It is a beautifully restored palace complex based on the same concept as the Forbidden City in Beijing. It is very easy to walk the grounds and imagine what happened here in days of yore. The architecture a d workmanship is indeed fit for a king.
We were fortunate to visit the citadel in warm sunshine. A must see for everyone. Plenty of coffee stops and distractions available for those who are less interested in history!
"We purchased a tour ticket, this enabled us to pay the once here, but then travel to the other sites and get in on this ticket, great idea, one adult to visit 3 sites cost 280,000 local, but does not include transportation costs.

Once in, you have many things to see and learn about, explained also in English, steeped in history dating back to the 18th century.

There are gift shops, and drinks available and even the chance to have your photo taken in clothes from the Dynasty days. ( unsure of cost)

Be warned, when it rains, some steps can be very slippy.

This place is a great visit, worth the money, and most of it is on one level bar the odd set of steps, so nothing strenuous

Well worth the money , if you are after a time scale for the visit, give yourself a good 3 hours."
"We had a nice time visiting the Forbidden City, but we visited the one in Beijing before, which was off course much more impressive.
This one is good to spend some time and walk around, not crowded..."
The monuments are Not very impressive and is missing some maintenance work. The whole place is not fairly equipped with English guidance.
"The most important place you have to see in Hue...
Royal palace of Nguyen dynasty. Was very damaged during war, some parts are almost gone, but others are still amazing

Entrance fee 150 000, about 2hours, one entrance, one exit, close at 17. Not enough guides here..."
"Amazing buildings but also amazing ruins, so much destroyed in the wars. Much being restored but we didn't feel it all needed to be done, really - often get a better sense of history without it all being perfect.

You can either buy a ticket just for this or a combined one to include the other main attractions of the tombs - this ticket lasts at least two days so you can see these other things on another day.

Much effort is being put into restoration but, like many places in Vietnam, information on the background to them is rather thin on the ground - even a decent map would help."
After first few days of rain we decided to just do it regardless. So glad we did as it's truly an amazing location steeped in history! Do not miss!!
"The old royal compound was very impressive. The wall is 10 km long and you can walk around pretty much anywhere. The actual buildings have been restored relatively well but it's sad to think how much of the treasure was stolen by the French. The throne room I liked the best and it's neat to think the history that happened there.
The one caution I would make is be careful not to get lost as the grounds are huge and there is not much signage to tell you where to go."
"The Purple Palace is a must see in Hue but unfortunately is mostly destroyed and only partly rebuild and renovated. Once a big area, only the inner circle remains and even that only in part. What remains is still impressive and they have a lot of old photographs with English explanations. I usually would not recommend guides but maybe picking one here is appropriate because otherwise you would not get a good grasp of what once was and why the palace was built in that particular order."
"...was something planned into our trip... music, lion dance and lots of festive activity mixed with the magnificence of the citadel itself all made for a great day out..."
A huge sprawling place very impressive. Take time to take in the vastness ! Sadly our visit hampered by pretty torrential rain and there is a lot to see outside. Have to be aware of rough paving and huge puddles. Not ancient but gives an idea of life at the time. If raining beware of poncho and umbrella sellers thrusting their wares into your face even if you are wearing a rain coat. Also do not open purse near them one grabbed more money from one of our party. On a sunny day it must be magnificent.
"This is a must see in Hue .

Fairly big area and a lot of visitors.

Would be nice with more information in English.

A significant part of the buildings are being renovated during our visit.

Entrance fee VND 100,000 per person"
"the imperial city is very pretty and has beautiful gardens, however my experience was negatively affected by incessant heavy rain.

if you really have to visit during some of the (seemingly countless) rainy days in hue i'd recommend going in plastic flip-flops and poncho with a big umbrella. in some parts of the complex we were walking through water way too deep for our sneakers to stay dry.

plan your visit well, be prepared if you're gonna visit during heavy rain!

other than that, worth visiting for sure!"
"Hey, it's Hue and this place is why the city was the Imperial capital. That said, many buildings are gone (lots of wars). Signs help a bit (and almost all are in both English and Vietnamese.) Someday they'll add better maps, videos, etc to help you make sense out of what's missing.

(Requires a bit of walking, but not much stairs). Pavement is generally good and safe."
This place is worth the money as we spent several hours in here. A lot of the original buildings were not there as the were destroyed during the war but you learn a lot and whats left is stunning.
We expected a little more of the forbidden purple city. It was very big and it had its charms. But if you went to the vatican or something like that this is not the same magnificants.
"I was very impressed on my visit to the Hue citadel. I bought a ticket allowing entrance to 4 sites, the citadel and 3 tombs. This cost 360,000 dong but entrance for only the citadel is a cheaper 150,000 dong.

At the ticket counter I also decided to splurge for a guide (150,000 I hour). I thought this a worthwhile investment as the site was huge and with some parts being just rubble or a hole in the ground the information from the guide was important for getting a fuller understanding of things.

I was lucky enough to catch the 15:00 performance at the Royal theatre (200,000 per person). The 40 minute show was fantastic, with the lantern dance and unicorn story being the highlights. Note that if you plan to see a performance, show times are listed outside the theatre and there is a 5 person minimum for the show to go ahead. There's nothing stopping you going alone and buying 5 tickets, having the theatre all to yourself, but I'm not sure it was quite that good.

In the western courtyard you can pose in Royal regalia and have your photo taken with a couple of on hand concubines (190,000) which makes for an unusual souvenir.

After you've visited the citidel you can use the ticket (this will not count as one of your 4 sites as is included in the citadel ticket) to enter the nearby Royal Museum of Antiques, which is worth the 2 minute walk from the East gate.

I enjoyed the whole afternoon spent in the citadel, seeing Vietnamese ancient history in the pavilions, temples and arches, combined with the modern history of American bullet holes and the rubble left in the wake of the French."
"The other review is right, You need a guide. We had a great one from A&K, While most of it is reconstruction (so much was destroyed in the war) it's a genuine reflection of real thing. Has a way to go but we enjoyed learning it's history."
We did a full day tour which includes the Citadel. Did a boat tour first then a walking tour around the imperial city and the forbidden city. It's a shame it was all destroyed by the Americans in the 60's. As a result they have only rebuilt a handful of the buildings. The history of the kings is fascinating. It's one of the must do things in Hue.
"Our tour guide, Ahn, brought us to the gates of the Citadel on a dragon boat slowly motoring on the Perfume River in a steady drizzle. We entered the Imperial City through a second gate and before us arose the ornate and manicured 400 year old site. Dense flower arrangements lining the bridges and water ponds, remnants of the Tet celebrations just past, created an even more magical visual impact. Further along, as we approached the third and final gate, we passed into the Forbidden City where only the royal family and the upper mandarins were previously allowed. The large absence of buildings here (100 buildings were present at its height) was a sad reminder of the destruction of the site in 1968 by American bombs. Vietnam has had a long history full of achievements, peace and war. The Imperial City is well worth visiting as Hue, until 1945, was the capital city of Vietnam. I think a tour guide is essential to explain the history of the region, the workings of the hierarchy in the Imperial City and to bring this amazing site to life."
This is quite a large site but most of it has been destroyed in the wars. It is interesting to imagine how it might once have been and there are some good videos on display which show this. The gardens are very nice and you can get away from the crowd by visiting the extremities of the site where the coach parties do not go. Set aside a couple of hours to do this site justice.
"This citadel is very unexpected. There is birthing like it anywhere else. It's more or less a lesser Forbidden City in some aspects, but nothing to in other aspects. The place us big and the palaces that remain very beautiful. The visit is very interesting and it's worth to have a guide to better understand everything."
And a must see in Hue. The buildings that survived the multi wars from French and US are incredible. The history behind the complex is complex and worth the trip. We thoroughly enjoyed our time.
"Its a very nice walk around in the citaldel. However, as with most large outdoors experiences here in SE Asia, I suggest to come as early as possible for three very good reasons. Good light for photos, less crowded and less hot. Around 9am this place is full of tourists, hot and humid. If you are interested in history and photography id recommend to go, but there are many other places in Hue that are more strikingly beautiful."
Went here and bought a combo ticket (560 for 2 people for entrance to this place and 2 of the tombs nearby) We spend about an hour and a half inside the place. Its pretty big and there are a ton of tourists. Most places aren't finished or haven't been rebuild properly. Some of the buildings look nice but most do not. The price is pretty steep for this place. Wouldn't have gone there if I had to go again for this place (150 pp)
We went during the rainy season -- which also meant that parts of the grounds were partially flooded but I think this added to the sense of faded grandeur. The grounds are really large and lovely to walk around.
"This is the historuc seat of the Nguyen dynasty. There are some explanatory signs in English, so definitely worth going even solo, but the rich history deserves more than the site provides."
"The imperial citadel in Hue was an amazing experience not even dampened by the torrential rain we experienced.
The state of the buildings upkeep, however, was significantly lacking.
A bit of a cleanup would significantly enhance the experience without damaging the heritage or history"
Really nice place to visit. Lots of history and plenty to visit once inside the walls. Can easily spend a few hours walking around. There is a very informative video you can watch before you start to explore which tells you what everything was used for. Only downside was the price to get in and it wasn't very well signed once you've started walking round. On the whole a nice day out and interesting to visit.
Very beautiful place to visit. Need 4 or more hours to really enjoy. Very historical place. With lots of history.
"This was really much more than expected. I would compare it to Alhambra in Spain but without the crowd, and not so old neither. I really recommend you to take a guided tour. Some parts of it was destroyed during the war but personally I consider that to make the trip even more interesting. You need a whole day here if you like history and beautiful buildings/gardens. Take on your walking shoes. Bring sunscreen, or umbrella."
"If you are visiting Vietnam you should visit the city of Hue and Citadel which is the imperial house of this city. Even though many of the buildings were destroyed during the Vietnam War, there are several buildings that have been restored to recreate the history of the emperors of that time. This complex is considered as a cultural heritage by Unesco.
They must visit it to see the life of the emperors and the history of South Vietnam before the war"
This ancient structure is like the Forbidden City of Beijing. The intricate detailed design is fantastic. You should have more time to visit every corner of the Citadel for much appreciation.
Interesting place. They rebuilt so much und so well. I was here 10 years back and that time they started working on it. Hue anyway is a graet place to relax. Take your time and stay few days.
"Very impressive and a must see. It was a shame that such big areas was not taking care of in such a amazing place, dangerous holes my little girl could fall in and weeds taking over. Do not eat there!"
Do t miss this when in Hue. Worth the entrance fee. Interesting and beautiful. You do not need a guide. It's very easy to do on your own.
"While this forbidden palace is certainly not on par with China's, it is certainly worth a visit. It is within the old walled-city of Hue, Vietnam's original capital. There are many small complexes to visit. Some are small museums, some are eateries. All can be done within a few hours."
"Recommended place to visit with a guide, huge place many interesting buildings and lots of history.Very large ground inside the citadel. You need at laest 3-4 hours to cover the entire city"
With our guide we found this a very interesting place to visit. There is a reasonable amount of walking but you can do (within reason) as much or little as you like. As with everywhere in Vietnam there are some high steps so if mobility is an issue just be prepared.
"A forbidden city of vast area.
Well worth visiting to help one's understanding of the lead up to the establishment of Vietnam in 1945. Unfortunately many of the buildings destroyed during war with the French then the Americans. The buildings remaining are being painstakingly restored. Allow 2 hours to half a day"
"Well with the money and the time to visit. The buildings are well on their way to a high quality restoration. For art and architecture fans, this is an excellent choice. Vietnamese, we are told, believe it is too expensive, but for tourists, it is a star attraction.

"The Citadel was badly damaged during the war and is still undergoing restoration. It is, however, very well worth a visit. In its prime it must have been a truly astounding site.

We would advise taking a guide to better understand the history of the Citadel, its architecture and its occupants. (Really useful if you later visit some of the royal tombs.) Depending on the weather, it may be preferable to make your visit earlier in the morning when it is cooler and you can better enjoy the sights."
UNESCO World Heritage site - a must visit on Hue. You can see the buildings been preserved till present as well as those were destroyed during war times. So buildings managed to be reconstructed and hope it will bring a new life to add on its history. Lots of walking as the place is very huge. Definitely need a tour guide with you to understand it's history & we are happy to have Ms Lam (our tour guide) to be with us.
"Located close to the perfume river and Tran Tien Bridge the Citadel is must see tour to enjoy whilst exploring the city of Hue.
Built between 1804 and 1833 and surrounded by moats, the Citadel offers the traveller a true insight in to Vietnamese royal life. What remains following the conflicts with the French and Americans still astonishes you as you gaze and take in the vast scale to which the Citadel commands. Much work is being carried out to restore buildings and garden areas to their former glory, its painstaking work for those involved, with sponsorship being provided from many international countries.
If travelling alone, its best to travel anticlockwise around the complex, as this makes navigation around the complex easier, as there was a shortage of signs to direct you to the specific areas within.
Group tours we found are a great way to learn more about the local history, and what life was like during the 18th century. What we found was that you couldn't really gauge the size of the Citadel and surrounding area till you enter through the Ngo Mon Gate which leads in to the Imperial enclosure, its immense.
Beautifully carved pheonixes adorn the roof tops of the buildings with ornate mosaics and highly lacquered carvings decorating the columns can be found on most of the buildings within.
There are so many wonderful places to visit whilst inside the grounds, the forbidden purple city, not much remains, this was for the personal use of the emperor, Co Ha gardens, these have been beautifully created over the past few years. The Emperor's reading rooms and Royal theatre all offer a glimpse in to royal life.
One can really appreciate the workmanship and shear effort which was taken to build the Citadel, its truly spectacular.
There really is too much to see and take in during the full day tour, but I'm sure once you've visited this magnificent place you'll agree, life must have been very good for those who lived their lives within Citadel."
"The Imperial City in Hue is a magnificent place to visit. The Citadel is beautiful but imposing at the same time, the mighty home to the monarchs of old. If you go, be prepared to want to spend most of the day touring the entire complex. A few hours just won't cut it.

From the 9 holy cannons to the 9 dynastic urns to the Pavilion of Splendor everything at the Citadel is worth a look. For good reason did UNESCO deem it a World Heritage Site. I was there on a rainy day and still had an amazing experience. I wish I had more time."
"The Citadel is a must see, sitting on 100 acres of history. Many of the original builds are there, and you can go inside. For about $10 CND you can get and English speaking guide, will worth it."
Really nice buildings. The whole citadel is great place but pretty boring without guide to have context to all those beatiful houses etc
It must have been a beautiful splendid city with a huge and glorious palace before it was badly damaged by the US bombs. After a long time of neglect the vietnamese try to restore carefully some of the left over temples and palaces as far as there are still reconstructable structures. Still it gives you only a faint an idea of how great it must have been once apon a time.
"Great day at the imperial city, do bare in mind that the site is massive and does mean lots of walking! Lots to learn about and the architecture is pretty impressive! A must see in Hue! 150,000 dong entry fee."
"Highly Under Rated - We initially thought this would take less than half a day, given the reports of how much had been damaged during the Vietnam war, we spent the entire day there and could have easily gone back a 2nd day. While there are parts that are damaged or completely levelled with the exception of the foundations, there is still plenty intact and lots of restoration going on. A mini version modelled on Peking's (Beijing) Imperial City, but its still very big. If you are a photographer, take spare memory cards and batteries because between us we took over 1100 photo's and someone ran out of memory. The quality and extensive nature of this sight is understated. Its peaceful and relaxing and so large and removed from the rest of the city you can't hear a single vehicle....just silence and birds, but you are in the centre of town."
Even with many tourists present we were able to get to experience the quiet corners of this quite incredible citadel. The walk from our hotel was invigorating and REALLY interesting. Afterward we ate at a hole-in-the-wall restaurant in the local area that was delicious.
"Took me 3,5h to get there from Hoi An and I had huge expectation but unfortunately I could save the time and the trip. The areal is OK and they have very nice buildings, garden and a museum. In way there the driver stoped at the Marmor mountain from where you have a very nice view to the sea and surrounding area."
"While the Citadel is an impressive set of buildings; since a large part has been destroyed - which is still under restoration, I am not sure if it alone is worth a 2-2.5 hour road trip from Da Nang. You have some nice structure but in large part pictures with some descriptions. Maybe once it's fully restored it will be worth a visit!"
"This distinctive ""tiered"" pagoda was the home of many of the monks who opposed the South Vietnamese government during the American/Vietnamese War. One of them went to Saigon where he immolated himself in protest. Walk the grounds, pray to the Buddha, honor those who lived purposeful lives. Many Buddhists visit the magnificent temple within to pray. The grounds are lovely, with many bonsais, flowers, pathways, forming a quiet oasis. A macabre relic is housed in a garage: the blue Morris that transported the brave monk to Saigon for his protest."
We spent the best part of a half a day wandering around the old city. Lots of English signs to help you.
"An interesting visit with our tour guide who gave us valuable information we wouldn't otherwise have. Interesting to see how past emperors lived. Note that the site is being slowly restored so much of it doesn't exist. There is alot of walking to do so wear comfortable shoes. As with all sights in Vietnam, they do not accommodate elderly and wheelchairs"
"You definitely go here on your trip. Specially when you are crazy on taking photos...
But it's really expensive for fee to try on King's clothes!"
"I had watched several videos about Hue and the citadel before visiting. But none of the videos showed the real beauty of the citadel. We visited it on a sunny day during the Tet holiday.
Plan spending a few hours here, as it is a big complex with several pagodas and palaces.
Make sure to also visit the emperor tombs during your stay in Hue - they are amazing."
This is avery impressive complex that has been partially restored. The portions that have been restored are marvelous and well worth a visit.
"Huge ancient city within the city - it's absolutely mesmerising and a lot has been preserved and restored. We didn't have a guide, so feel like we may have missed out a bit, but it was still certainly worth the visit!"
"This is a big area with lots of pretty gates, temples, ruins and buildings. I liked exploring the more remote corners of the place, where there were less tourists but still interesting things to see."
We got our taxi and came here on our own . There is no way you can absorb all the history here in one visit . I like it better than the Forbidden City of Beijing. It is steeped in history and they setting with the waterway and gardens make it even more beautiful.
"The complex is a mandatory visit if you’re in Hue. You can do it in 3 or 4 hours.
Inside you’ll find ruins, reconstructions and same of the original buildings from the 19th century. Be ready to walk a lot. Take a water bottle and some snacks with you, there’s not much offer inside to eat or drink."
"The whole Nguyen dynasty is here but must have a guide to tell historic stories. Very asian architecture, place is quite spacial enough to enjoy walking."
Hue Imperial Palace is a must see place if you are here. It has so much history. The palace is beautiful even though 75% was destroyed by the war. My husband and I spent 5 hours to see the buildings. But I don't think we manage to see all of them. The palace is huge. A lot of walking. Bring water and wear comfortable shoes. Highly recommended!
It's a long visit so go early morning or after lunch. Too much heat and you will get tired quite easily.
This is a massive citadel contained within a 10km wall. The site of the Nyuigen dynasty. The buildings are not that old having been completed in 1833. But the history is fascinating. You need a couple of hours th find it head towards the massive flag pole on the bank of the perfume river
"We visited Imperial Hui and the Citadel with an independent tour from our cruise ship docked at Chang May. We booked with Viatours who provided a car, driver and an English speaking guide and we enjoyed a very interesting tour of the Citadel with an informative guide.Lunch was provided and we ended the day with a dragon boat ride on the river. Very good tour but would like to return to spend more time exploring the Citadel and the forbidden city."
"150.000 Dong, even for students is way too much for what you get for your money. It was okay, but i would not pay 150.000 Dong again"
"You I've to pay 150k Dong to go inside, but I guess it's a reasonable price. It's really nice. You can see a lot of old picture of the former empire. They renovated a lot houses, but not every house. A big part of the citadel was destroyed through the Tet offensive."
Built in the 17th century this large fortress is well worth a visit. A must if you are visiting Hue. It was badly bombed during the Vietnamese war and many of the buildings were damaged. However many still remain and it's a serene and mystical place. Give yourself plenty of time. It's huge!
"We decided to devote a day to the visit of the imperial enclosure within the Citadel in Hue. This was the right decision as it is a huge site with plenty to see, and there are a number of lunch opportunities. The site is impressive including all the buildings and gardens and it was very to easy spend the whole day there. We noticed a snake sun bathing on the steps in the To Mieu temple complex (SW corner), fashionably blending in with the colour of the steps, with the exception of its green head which was its giveaway. After this we decided not to walk on the grass, which you are allowed to do, but to keep to the pathways. Don't let this put you off visiting."
"When we first arrived at the Bus/coach depot in Hue we were confronted with many people trying, almost forcing us to buy hats or other goods. Intentions were to visit the Citadel and chose not to due to the constant harassment on every street that led to the ancient part of the city.
The city was intense with traffic and motorbikes, we thought we left this behind in Ho Chi Minh, this is not what we were looking for in Vietnam so met up with a couple that were on the same shuttle from the hotel and the driver took us to a recommended restaurant, Y Thao Garden close by which was peaceful, great genuine atmosphere and food. We spent a couple of hours there and then were glad to return back to the hotel. Maybe a guide should have been arranged beforehand to appreciate more of this historic city which we did not see."
"Though one would expect it is a must see attraction, I am unsure of how I feel about it. Granted, the Citadel suffered horribly because of the war, and I assume the tickets costs are to help recover it from the destruction it suffered, but it was the last attraction I visited during my stay in Hue and maybe some of the magic was lost because I had already seen so many beautiful things. The morning before I left was when I went to visit, really early and it was pretty peaceful to have this p,ace practically for myself. I found it interesting to see the pictures and read about the buildings but was not enraptured by it. Not precisely a waste of money or time but I feel there are better things to see if you are tight on time."
"Loved the architecture. Wish we would have signed up for a tour guide, we could have learned so much more about the Imperial City."
It is perfect but we don't know why the entrance fee is so high. Need to improve the tourist information and something inside. It is still a beautiful attraction in Hue.
We went to this sight as part of a shore excursion. The area is very similar to the forbidden palace in Beijing. However the site bears the marks of the armed conflicts that this area has gone through in the past century. It really is apparent that this area used to house a royal family. It was very useful to have a guide go through this area with us.
We wandered around without a guide and still found it interesting. The teenagers liked being able to walk at their own pace. Bring an umbrella this time of year.
Wonderful place with so much to see. Just when you think you've seen it all- think again. I learnt so much here and had a great time.
"Nice walk around the grounds and some good photo opportunities. Bullet holes and war damage still very visible.

Was confused about all the black walls. I read one place saying it was napalm staining??

Anyway we spent a couple of hours walking round."
Pretty bigger than I expected. Beautiful and historic place. There's some mobile car service for looking around. 생각보다 넓어서 한참을 돌아다녔어야 했고요 되게 예쁩니다 후에 와서 안 가기 좀 그런 곳이에요 꼭 가세요 다리 아프면 투어 해주는 전동차도 있더라고요
"It is one of the must visit places in Hue, but actually there are not many things to look around. Most of the buildings are under construction. Only one main building is completely restored now. Entrance fee is 150,000 vnd. 1 hour is enough to look all around the palace."
"We've visited the citadel in cloudy weather; and it was still quite impressive. Especially the size. A guide is probably nice to have but not needed in our opinion, because a very informative video in English can be found in one of the first buildings. Watch it before you walk any further as it places everything in perspective. Without a guide we had plenty of time to walk around ourselves, although admitted a bit aimlessly sometimes.

Ticket price is 150.000 VND. If you want to visit all the Tombes too, check if a cheaper combi ticket applies to you (360.000 VND and non-refundable AFAIK). A guided tour with a touring bus may be your best option in this case too, as the tombes are further away.

We visited the citadel a day before we went on a tour with tombes included. Skipping only the citadel led to some waiting time / mildly interesting placeholder for us from the tour guide. Not too bad though."
"Very nice
You cannot come to Hué without this visit ! So cultural.
It is the second time I come here"
We visited the citadel and have to say it was only just worth the effort. Definitely not a must do event.
"The Imperial City of Hue lies enclosed within the vast walls of this Citadel and one can easily spend a whole day ambling through its spaces, enchanted by the multiple monuments and the glory of each one.
To begin with, there are different types of entry tickets available at the gates and you can choose the type most relevant to you based on the time you can spare as well as the way you want to combine the citadel with the tombs of the kings which lie on the outskirts of the city.
You begin walking from the outer gates of the Citadel (pick one from any of the 10) and moats towards the Hall of Supreme Harmony that is simply marvelous in its detail, embellished in red and gold all over. You can watch a short, well made video to give you a brief introduction on the layout of the place. The Forbidden City lies further in with its enclosures and palaces for the royal family.
The typically traditional Eastern architectures including majestic palaces, tombs and museums. Each of these is unique in their style and is maintained in good condition. There is a gorgeous tea house in the middle section of the Citadel and I was so in love with its lotus pond and wooden furniture that I found it hard to leave.
Long corridors with beautiful red doors and sunlight shining through make you feel like you have moved back into that era! Ornate symbols on the ceilings, rooftops and even on the furniture itself makes for an amazing experience if you have an eye for detail.
There are plenty of rest rooms within the large citadel as well as little stores for souvenirs and bottled water in case you are spending almost a whole day here.
I would love to go back here someday and once more get lost within its enchanting confines and soak in a bygone era!"
Hue isn't bustling with fun activities so this is an okay place to go if you have nothing else to do and have low expectations. The architecture is quite impressive and the video played in the first main building at the end of the path as you walk in was quite informative and told us what we needed to know. Without seeing this we would have had no idea what was going on or where to go as there is barely any info as you go around. Nice for a walk round but if you want all the history of it I'd recommend getting a tour guide. Also quite pricey for Vietnam we found.
"Would definitely recommend visiting the Imperial City. There is a lot of restoration being done but there are still some beautiful buildings including the throne room to see. There is quite a lot of information displayed, but we took our lonely planet guide which gave more information about the ruins and history. Beautiful traditional art is also on display."
"A must see in Hue, make sure you have at least two hours not to rush and see all of the grounds. Well worth it. Usually less people first thing in the morning."
The Imperial City of Hue is one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites - a walled fortress and palace - part of the ancient city of Hue which was a capital city of the Nguyen Dynasty. There are total of ten main majestic gates leading to The Citadel and The Forbidden City. In some of the temples taking pictures is forbidden. I don`t recommended like activity in a rainy day.
It is a must to spend at least 4 hours Ingrid intricate complex of buildings yet so proportional . You will love to feel the breeze while resting in one of its many shadows or viewing Lethe colorful carps reaching for food.
"Took us half day to see the whole citadel and that was pretty enough time. It's being already restored, but it needs few more years to get more representative. Unique place, must seen as top."
"We only had 24 hrs in Hue and unfortunately it was raining the whole time. We got a taxi there and upon paying our entrance fee, we went to the tour guide office to find it empty. We arrived quite late, around 3.30pm so im not sure if they didnt work after a certain time or it was due to the weather.
The Citidel is impression but i would say a guide is a must as we walked about aimlessly with little info about the story of the place. It is one of the main attractions of Hue so its a must see, but it can be improved."
The Citadel was a fascinating experience and gave us an insight into Vietnamese history and culture. The displays of the various Kings were interesting and our tour guide Key was full of information that he eagerly shared. We were surprised at the size of the grounds and would have liked more time to explore them in greater depth.
"If you want to visit Citadel only, you need to pay 150.000 Dong for the ticket. The experience inside the Citadel can be around 1-2 hours. It's an interesting site to visit, nice architecture and gives a glimpse of the last dynasty of Vietnam. It's a huge site with various structures and a huge bonsai garden. We did not get a tour guide and managed to see the whole place, however there is not much explanation on sites.
There is a tiny map of the Citadel behind the ticket to help you find your way, however it's very small and can be confusing sometimes to figure out where you are at and how to exit. Sure a tour guide makes it easier, but most historical Unesco sites, provide better sources of information for visitors.
We usually prefer to visit places without a tour guide because we like going around with our pace, having flexibility and nowadays you can find valuable, and even more detailed information online."
"Still under construction in many areas. Very big, a thorough visit would require 3 hours. In some places not allowed to take pictures. Be sure to check out the bonsai section towards the east side. Nice walk around the edges. Some areas not very clean. 150000 for foreign people, including the entrance to the nearby museum."
"The Citadel is huge, you could easily spend a few hours here! Lots of information available in English, and there are many guides if you want to pay a fee.

Not crowded, and largely outside. Worth a visit."
"If you enjoy paying way too much to walk through the remnants of a once great palace then this is good for you. If not just avoid. This may feel like a must see in Hue but it really isn't and there really isn't much to see. A bunch of unexplained, unoriginal items mixed with terribly restored buildings and heaps of tourists. Go pick rice with the locals in the fields, you'll have a better experience and you won't have to pay a thing."
"The original capital city and an amazing old building/palace with a great restoration project in place.
150,000 VND (about £5.50) ridiculous, as in some places in Europe you could spend £20 for access to a place like this.
It is well worth a visit and I would recommend you allow 3+ hours to have a good wander around.
You can do this on a rainy day but you miss out on some of outside stuff."
"If your interested in history you must pay a visit to Hue Citadel during your stay. Some the architecture is very old and some parts are even being restored. The ticket price was a 150,000D, which is a little expensive but it is worth it to see this historical site. A visit in the morning is best as you can get there before any big tour groups arrive there. There is also an option to buy a ticket to enter four historical sites in Hue, if you plan to visit at least four it will save you some money."
"This is a gem. Gradually being restored after lots of damage during war so some bits still a work in progress but that adds to the charm. A really nice place to just wander around and imagine what it might have been like 100yrs ago. We have both teenage and young kids so we wander slowly at times but we were there for around 2 hrs.

Tickets were a little puzzling. It says under 7 free but when we informed them of our childrens age the ticket lady told us 2 children free. We paid adult for our 16yo and child for the 13yo but she didn't charge us for the 11yo and the 6yo. We clarified that the 11yo was 11yo and the ticke lady again said 2 children free so not entirely sure how that worked. But hey, it worked in out favour! So I recommend just telling them your kids ages and let them tell you how much to pay here.

There are a few little shops inside but no real food that we noticed. We happened to have some food with us and found a few nice areas to sit and eat. One being the garden surrounded by a pond in the north-eastern corner of the complex (Vuon Thieu Phuong). So it would be a nice place for a picnic lunch away from traffic chaos. Lots of rubbish bins around too so it didn't appear to be not allowed."
"I would love to see when this palace was in its complete form. Too bad only about half of the buildings remain today. The ones remain, however, are still impressive and surely worth a visit."
You must see this during your time in Hue (and you literally can't miss it because of its size). It is steeped in history and a significant landmark in the history of Vietnam. Take your time to visit the various momumenrs and buildings within. Great photo opportunities await
"Quite a lot of walk around, I would say budget a lest 2 hours to cover most of it. Impressive buildings and a lot of history can be learned. We did not have a guide but one may be of benefit."
The inner city has something very Nice and indescribable about it. It is definitely a good stop for your Vietnam experience.
"Hue was a big battle ground during the 1968 Tet offensive when I was very young and just forming my own opinions and world views.

So I was going to Hue where over the citadel had flown the red flag of the north Vietnamese for about three weeks as they fought back the Americans who gradually retook the citadel. I had read an account of it from the American point of view.
We decided against doing the touristy motorbike tour of the surrounding sights and we walked into the citadel through the gate that the Americans stormed into. There were little holes in the walls but it was difficult to tell if they were bullet holes or not. The bigger holes had been filled in, but again it was difficult to tell what was simple repair and what was restoration after war damage. I know that a lot of the citadel was destroyed in the battle, especially the central 'forbidden purple city' area.

Several rickshaw drivers persisted with offering us rides, usually quoting prices in dollars, which seemed somewhat ironic.

The area just inside the gate was clear and grassed. Had it always been like that or had this area been flattened in the battle? There was no information on this. We walked on and it gradually became more like a standard Vietnamese road with narrow shop entrances and people sitting in doorways selling nothing. There was no booklet or English tourist guide to be had anywhere, which we might well have bought.
We turned left to go through the gate into the forbidden city area. The guy at the entrance forbade us to go in. We had to buy a 'ticket'. Where could we buy a ticket, we asked. To the right, came the answer. We walked back to the road around the walls and went right. There was no sign of anywhere to buy tickets. A rickshaw driver advised us that we could not buy a ticket before 2pm anyway, an hour later, so why not take a ride with him? Just a dollar.

We walked on and found a sign to a museum, so we wondered if they might sell the right ticket. We went there and a rickshaw driver outside advised us that we needed a ticket to go into this museum and they did not sell tickets here for this museum. As the gate was open and no-one was around we walked in. There was a man in a 'gallery' showing off artefacts. He said we should just carry on. So we did. It was quite interesting and we went into a big wooden structure that advertised itself as 'the most popular museum in Vietnam', however that was measured.

There were four people by the entrance to the impressive wooden building who were more interested in selling us books (but only those unsuited to what we wanted) rather than in looking at our non-existent ticket. Once we had finished looking around we asked them where we could get a ticket. They pointed down the road back the way we had come and we should go 'straight on'. If we went straight on we would hit the large wall and I did not fancy trying to scale it to get in.

This all felt very Vietnamese. Officially we needed a ticket but unless there was someone on the gate then we were OK However there was no help for the independent tourist about where to get the said ticket. Those who we asked did not have sufficient English to explain what we needed to do.

Eventually we discovered from another rickshaw driver – our main source of information – that we could buy a ticket 'at the main entrance', wherever that was. We could not go in through the gate where we had tried to go in as that was 'exit only'. For one dollar we could have a ride to the entrance in the rickshaw.

We walked in the direction we thought most consistent with what we had been told by various rickshaw drivers. Rounding the corner of the high 'forbidden city' walls we saw an enormous red flag fluttering on a large flag pole – just as it had for those three weeks during the Hue Tet battle. Then it had been a potent symbol of resistance against a supremely powerful aggressor, flashed around the world into every home with a TV.
That must be where the entrance was, and so it proved. Now the flag was showing the way we had to go.

Inside the Forbidden City we soon discovered that much of it had been completely destroyed by the battle. Some buildings had been reconstructed, but very many had not. However instead of leaving the ruins as a powerful reminder of the destructive power of war, it had all been flattened, or sanitised so it looked OK So it was now a partial rebuild based on old photographs, with big gaps where reconstruction had not taken place at all.

The Soviets had rebuilt their ruined magnificent buildings with expertise and thoroughness when we saw places like Petrodvorets in 1983, less than forty years after the second world war, and what the Russians had done was beautiful and truly impressive. What the Vietnamese had done, around fifty years after the destruction in Hue, was partial. What was there was interesting, especially the sections that had mostly survived the destruction, but it was far from rebuilding the forbidden city as it once was.

Nevertheless there were hidden treasures all over the large site, ones we had no idea were there when we came in as there were no guide books, or maps, to be bought anywhere, and indeed little signage that meant anything to us. An appreciation of how the whole area once looked was shown in a film (Korean made) and by a model. However the model did not distinguish between what was once there, what had survived the destruction, what had been totally rebuild and what was still completely absent. However we could not carry the model around to guide us.

Maybe we should have done the modern thing and photographed the model. However everywhere there were signs that said 'no picture' (sic) or the less definite 'no flash', by which they seemed to mean no pictures inside any of the buildings, although no-one seemed to bother much if you did take some with the flash on. The point of having no pictures taken seemed unclear as there was no gift shop to sell you pictures near the exit, as all other self-respecting tourist sites seem to have nowadays. We did find hidden in discreet corners at the back of the site a couple of shops that seemed to be selling you quite interesting actual relics, as that is what the prices implied, although there was no guarantee that they were not copies. They were undamaged by any bombs anyway.
We nearly became lost in the labyrinth at the back of the site with no maps anywhere to guide us. However we spotted the large red flag hovering by the entrance and were able to navigate back so we could go out of the one and only exit route.

Being what is meant to be a dry season, it poured with rain all day, the third day of heavy rain out of our four and a half days in Vietnam so far. This seems to be yet another climate anomaly and perhaps indicates where future battles need to be fought, but of a very different type to what happened in Hue."
Take about 2 hours to walk through leisurely. We had only an hour and it felt rushed. FYI: there are few cabs in the area so walk or plan your transport ahead of time.
We enjoyed our long walks at The Citadel. It's worth to visit. We didn't hire a tour guide but we somehow over head what the tour guides are telling tho not everything but it's good to know. It's a must see.
"If you are in need of something to do whilst in Hue then I would recommend a visit however you will only need an hour or so to visit.
It is a beautiful place to go with a lot of history however I would suggest having a tour guide as I'm sure they would provide a more interesting and meaningful experience than if you walk around yourself like we did."
"wonderful history of Nguyen dynasty and learnt so much about the last royalty of Vietnam.
Very beautiful architecture to combine Feng Shui philosophy. Very crowed with many group tours but still worth seeing."
Well worth a 2/3 hour tour when you also take in the Pagoda and a boat trip back to Hue on the Perfume River. Very interesting place to visit and our guide was very informative concerning the history of the palace
Pretty cool to see. I liked the old photos of the emporers and princesses. A lot of walking around required. It looks as though they are continuing to restore the buildings one by one.
"you should have a tour guide the information written is not so varied. you should visit in the early morning. If you are not a hurry traveller, spend sometime like early morning or late evening to walk around the citadel to feel the lovely air."
The proportions of this fabulous Citadel are wondrous. Take the time to watch the introductory reimaged Citadel dvd at the entrance. It is delightful to walk along the corridors and gardens of this refuge. Clearly it is better to be a royal than a servant!
"Visit the citadel early in the morning to beat the crowds. It's a peaceful and lovely property, and our guide gave us valuable historical information. Much of the property was destroyed in war, but is slowly being restored. Worth a visit and some time to reflect !"
"Interesting trip, but would bring a tour guide as there is not much written information available. Also, we went on a rainy day, which may have taken away from the experience."
"It's a surprisingly huge complex and you definitely need at least two to three hours if you plan on visiting every corner of it like I did. I recommend circling around through the left to right, as the exit is on the right. Don't miss the lovely older areas around the back. It's beautiful!"
do it by bike and walk around... its a great place.. the walls of the city are amazing and you can take some great photos ... take your own water/drinks as we found it difficult to find a drinks vendor when we needed it ...
"The ruins were neat to see... it's very damaged but you can still get an idea of the size of the imperial city. We wandered for a few hours but we found that it wasn't very well marked and nothing really corresponded with the map in our guide book. I would recommend going with a guide maybe? That way you make sure you're not missing anything. Although, it was still nice to wander around without a plan. Bring water! It gets really hot out in the open fields."
"Don't miss this if you're in to architecture, history, and scenery. I spent a very happy 3hours wandering around and just enjoying the sheer beauty of the place. Do note it's mostly in ruins after the wars."
The price to enter the Imperial City is worth it. The grounds are huge and very interesting. Might be worth getting a guide as we wandered around aimlessly but still enjoyed ourselves.
"A very interesting visit, but the citadel has been damaged by war and through age. The sights that remain vary in impressiveness. There are reconstruction projects being undertaken currently. A must visit when in Hué, but not necessarily an attraction that makes Hué a must visit when in Vietnam.?"
"I had visited the imperial city years ago and now again with my wife and parents. It was amazing then and it is amazing still.

Very well organised and maintained, this citadel is easy to navigate and consists of temples, gates, palaces, parks, moats and ruins.

It's beautiful, colourful and even with a lot of people never feels crowded because everything is spread out.

This is one of the main reasons to come to Hue."
We took cyclo taxis to this impressive fortress and enjoyed the ride around some of the perimeter before entering the Citadel. The Nguyen dynasty ruled from here from 1802 for over 100 years. It's a popular and large complex surrounded by moats. It attracts lots of tourists but is worth exploring at leisure so as to appreciate the temples and palaces. It was damaged during the war so some ruins remain inaccessible because they are being restored. A guide is useful to enhance your overall experience.
"Although there is some pertinent history attached to the The Citadel I felt like it was a bit run down and not very authentic. I enjoyed reading up on the Nguyen dynasty and it's rulers, but the architecture isn't much to see."
Our visit to the Citadella proved to be extremely interesting. The site is vast so be prepared to walk a lot. There are so many things to see so leave enough time for your visit. We particularly liked the wonderful theatre inside the Citadella. There are performances at different times of the day and we were sorry not to have been able to see one of them. We were grateful to our guide who provided us with the information needed to understand this amazing site .
"Little left really after the war, but they are slowly making inroads to restoration. Some areas obviously more interesting than others"
Beautiful and full of story. Different in architecture from everything I've seen so far on my trip (Thailand and Cambodia). The ticket is not expensive and I recommend you look for a good guide. Ours was not so great an I feel we missed a lot.
"This place was really impressive, even for a Vietnamese like me. Hopefully, in the future they can rebuild the rest of the fort"
"The ticket for the place is 150000 dongs that allows entrance to the citadel and the museum of antiques near the citadel.
The place is really interesting with alot of historic value the building are well preserved the have alot of english signs that explain each building purpose and the story behind the arctriture.
You can pass easily 2 hours all depend on your patience and the amount of level of interest you have about the Vietnamese royal family.
I do not think little children will enjoy this kind of place."
"Really worth seeing. We went in off season, and had parts of this large complex completely to ourselves. Watch the free video, as it's really useful info, plus a chance to sit in the cool. You don't need a guide if you watch and also have your Lonely Planet. There is some info in English at all the sites too. Golf carts are available, if you don't want to walk, but book in advance. 300,000 dong. We didn't use one. Just took our time, with lots of stops in the shady bits. Good affordable bakery cafe just inside, just after the Thai Hoa palace."
"The citadel was very interesting, you could spend a good couple of hours there. It is such a shame that they don't have the money to begin restoring some of the colourful features on the outside of th ebuildings to their former glory. One of the best things to do is get dressed up like and emporer and have you photo taken.
Unfortunately in the museum and inside palace you cannot take photos. But still well worth the visit."
"The palace, the grounds including the citadel, the museum are spread over a large area. All are interesting and take time to enjoy. Try to avoid being in too much of a rush. We also took a cycle tour of the perimeter for an hour at 150,000 dong per head which we were told was ""good"" value."
We went in with a tour which I would suggest to anyone visiting as there is a lot of info you would otherwise miss. The citadel is well kept though and they're in the process of rebuilding a lot of it...a lot of which was destroyed in the war. Definitely worth the trip and should spend around 3 hrs there...it is said that you need 4 to see all of it.
"When you're in Hue, I guess you will not miss that. It is perhaps the main attraction for tourist and very nice joint to Vietnamese history. It provides tons of information linked to even recent history enclosed with many pics of members of Nguyen dynasty. It provides a lot of information that can be easily absorbed. The area is quite huge including many gardens and shaded places. For Joining carps lovers it is a must go there kind of a place."
You will walk a lot as the buildings are spread out and there are of course many visitors . It was interesting but there are areas under construction . I expected it to be more spectacular but a lot of areas got damaged by the war.
"The Imperial Citadel is well worth a day visit. Located on extensive walled grounds, it is an amazing example of architectural mix like only Vietnam is capable of. Royal residences, throne and ceremony buildings, theatre and an array of temples, most have been well restored after being destroyed during the war and falling into disrepair.

There are plenty of little cafes hidden in the nooks and crannies of the Citadel to keep you dry in the event of rain.

If going by bicycle, leave it at the main gate, next to the outer rampart wall. A lady will look after it for a small fee. Like for everything else in Vietnam, negotiate."
"I was expecting something spectacular and historic. The buildings were interesting, but not as well preserved or attractive as many of those we have seen in Vietnam and Thailand. My husband is disabled, so we opted to use the electric buggy service to get around the Citadel. This cost 300,000 VND for 1 hour and consisted of the driver taking us round the outside of the walls, stopping at a couple of gates, saying ""15 minutes"", as she despatched us out, with no explanation as to where we were or what we were looking at, and then looked thoroughly fed up when we came back to the car and disturbed her snooze! Not worth the entrance fee."
"Stunning palace complex. Visit early in the morning as it can get oppressively hot and humidity in Huè in summer.
The Forbidden city is amazing, so much to see. Some amazing carvings and ornate buildings, temples and pagodas.
You'll need quite a while to see it and it's definitely worth shelling out for a guide- we learned a lot and got more out of the visit with the guides help."
"I really enjoyed this attraction. While many will complain that it has not been maintained well enough, I found that to be a selling point. It was very authentic and gave it more of an ancient historical feeling, and also made for great photos. I would definitely recommend visiting."
Requires a few hours to wander around. Cafe inside complex. Many parts to visit. A pity so much has been lost due to wars and the elements. Worth a look when in Hue.
It is a massive place to cover and we walked there for a few hours and only covered key areas. A lot of buildings were destroyed by French so the place went through some restoration project to bring it back to its original state. So it is worth visiting from historic exposure and cool photos. Additionally we were riding our scooter in the rain for a whole day so we didn't pay as much attention as we should of as we were tired and were a bit wet!
"Beautiful UNESCO World Heritage site that is being lovingly restored. Though the site has suffered from damage due to war there are still many buildings & grounds intact.

It helps to watch the video at the entrance to get a feel for the history & layout. Though there maps are not provided, it is fascinating to just wander about & discover all the treasures. There is a lot to see to keep exploring!"
Lots of information on the past of Vietnam great grounds and gardens but be careful walkway tiles can be very slippery in the rain
Although the price is quite expensive for Vietnam. The place will over some deeper insight in the history of Vietnam. Most of the citadel is still restored but the most important buildings are still intact.
"It's a shadow of the Forbidden City in Beijing, but it's a piece of Vietnamese history. You cannot take photos inside. Didn't take long to look around. We joined a day tour from Hoi An, thinking we may not have enough time to see everything. But if you've been to Beijing before then half a day is good enough."
"This was a positive surprise. As a must-visit-place in Hue, of course we went there but expected it to be a bit boring. As we didn't want to be rushed, we went on our own. That was the right decision, as we ended up spending four hours there, wondering around and taking lots of pictures. We had a guidebook with us and we watched the information movie at the Thai hoa palace in the beginning so we felt we knew enough. We enjoyed walking at the not-yet renovated sites where no other visitors were to be seen... also these places have a special air about them with weed growing over the ports and walls. Even if a lot was destroyed, you can see that renovation work is going on. The area really is huge so it's good to have enough water and snacks with you, although there are some (expensive) cafes on the site, also souvenir shops. We liked the fact that at none of these places we were pushed to ""buy something"", and that the whole area was being kept very clean. Going on a dry day definetely adds to the experience!"
"This complex where the emperors of Vietnam lived comprise multiple buildings and take several hours to walk around. Beautiful courtyards, palaces and temples reside in the complex."
"Wow, I remember when this place was under siege in the VN war. Walls and statues have bullet holes. Interesting old archetecture."
a nice experience and I reccomend to visit with an experience guide to maximize the information you may get.
It is not all that terrible. Numerous structures are reestablished and works go on. May be for experts it makes an issue as the structures are not credible. Make a point to run with a visit control as else you miss a great deal. It is not layed out for a westerner's visit and in spite of the fact that there are English plates the stories of the Kings and the way they lived are ideal to listen. In the event that you jump at the chance to plunge into history get ready for up to 3 hours. It is huge.
The imperial city is a walled fortress and palace in the city of Hue. The grounds of the imperial city are ringed by a moat - the water has been routed from the perfume river. Within the imperial city is the Purple Forbidden city. Prior to the Battle of Hue there were 160 buildings however after the battle on 10 major sites remain. The buildings that remain are being restored and preserved. An interesting insight to Emperor life.
"This place is a must in the list of Imperial cities to visit. A serene and mystic place. I can picture life in here, the reading room is very nice as well as the as the galleries inside the palace. Take time to visit this treasure, at least 3 hrs. minimum. Enjoy your visit.."
"Leave yourself as much time as possible for this. We could have spent hours just feeding the fish near the front gate. Inside there is so much to see. The gardens, buildings and exhibitions are amazing. Most treasured moment though was dressing the kids up as emperors, having their photo taken and having them printed on calendars and mugs. So much fun and value, value, value."
If you are in Hue this is a must see. That being said there definitely could be more signage and information provided. There is so much history here and it is easy to miss whole sections.
"The Citadel is probably's Hue's main tourist attractions and served as the imperial city of Vietnam's Nyugen dynasty for the most of the 19th century. Although the actual walls of the Citadel (approximately two kilometres on each side) are no longer easily determined these days, what is immediately obvious are those of the Imperial City. Surrounded by a moat, each wall is slightly less than half a kilometre in length and approximately five metres in height. The visitors' entrance is especially impressive, with what appears to be a stretched tower overlooking the bridge over the moat. Inside the Imperial City, buildings are much more sparse, an unfortunate consequence of the extensive damage sustained during the Tet Offensive of 1968. Only about one-fifth of the original number of buildings still stand, a number of which are undergoing much-needed restoration. In fact, restoration in some parts of the emperor's and empress's palaces are already well advanced and look nearly new. However, due to the size of the place, other areas still look a little neglected. Much of the architecture seen is Chinese in inspiration, not surprising since both imperial China and imperial Vietnam shared many philosophical and religious beliefs, if not ethnic similarities as well. There are quite a lot of areas to walk to, so give at least two hours and do wear comfortable shoes."
The Citadel was nice to see and interesting history. It is out of town a bit and as mentioned many stairs.
"Amazing ancient city well worth a day out..lots to see and do..
Very expansive amid a thriving business and residential area.
Deceptive in size and distance so be prepared use the cheap bicycle taxi for leisurely ride around takes an hour to just tour the area. Great museum nearby...tickets not available on the door must get them from Citadel etc"
We did the citadel on our own without a guide and loved it. You need a few hours to see everything and plenty of water. Very worth seeing.
"Easy to find. The local guides were very informative, helpful and knowledgeable. Some of the tiled pathways are covered in moss which was very slippy so in fear of sounding like my father..... best to wear comfortable non slip shoes to avoid slips and trips....."
We visited the site with a guide at the end of 2016. It rained but still worth the visit. Interesting video at the beginning explained the site and its various areas. Unfortunately it was badly bombed during the Vietnamese war where many of the buildings were damaged- currently many are undergoing reconstruction. However- a few buildings remain and still are very much worth the visit!
"Part of the challenge is that so much was destroyed by the French and especially the Americans. But some important buildings remain and authorities are rebuilding others. You get a good feel for the layout and the expanse, as well as how the emperors lived in isolation from the surrounding town. There is no information anywhere, so best to have a guide or a good guidebook. An announcement came out recently that audio guidebooks are on the agenda, but no timetable has been provided."
"Visited today very tatty and not looked after . We booked a 1 hour golf tour . The girl had a king size attitude problem . No information . Dropped at each gate which was all of 200 meters a part ""15 minutes"" only info we got . You could see what you wanted to in about 10 mins max each place . We did 3 .. erm 30 mins ? She drove for about 5 mins ???? 10 quid ?? Massive rip off"
"Our Vietnamese guide is very proud of the Citadel's history and tried his best to impress upon us the significance of the Imperial City. We visited in the light rain which made the complex seem even more dreary. There is very little explanation throughout the sights.

The Citadel is supposed to rival Beijing's Forbidden City but it is so damaged and run down that it is very difficult to envision the opulence and splendor of the past. Our guide talked about the emperors many concubines and the eunuchs that guarded the Vietnamese version of a harem.

The drop off point is in a large parking lot surrounded by a small shopping center. It is a 5 minute walk to the main gate to the Citadel. Once you pass the gate, the cannons are to your left. Then it is another 5 minute walk to the ticket booth.

From the ticket booth, you can see the Imperial City surrounded by a moat. Through the ""Foreign Visitor's Entrance"", you will see a walkway leading to the Throne Room. On bothe sides of the walkway are man-made pools filled with carp (food is available for purchase). As you near the Throne Room, you will see small stone ""markers"" on the far left indicating the positions for each level of court (such as court officials, ministers, military, etc). No photography allowed inside the throne room which is dark and sparse.

Very few sections were renovated and the restrooms near the gift shop were very badly ventilated."
To see this allow 2-3hours. Some stunning interiors and it's easy to imagine the grandeur that was once on display. It poured with rain when we visited so next time we'll hope to choose a sunny day 🌞
"It was an ok place to visit, although somewhat disappointing. Not much available information and the information that existed was not presented in a creative way."
I went to this place and literally took 300 photos. Absolutely must-see. Worth travelling to Hue specifically to see it. Entry price is good considering what is there. Don't ignore the rooftops - some of the best features are on display up there! Some areas have seen damage due to war and disrepair but it seems like they are hard at work restoring the place (one part looked like a building site with loads of artisans hard at work).
The imperial gardens is a majestic place to visit in Hue. Should not be missed. The forbidden city is also beautiful. :)
"Nice place to visit in hue , preferably with a local guide to get the best out of your time there......................."
We went there expecting something very big and in great condition like the forbidden city in Beijing. Not at all the case. All buildings are in poor condition as if they hadn't been maintained in years. Maybe that's in purpose but it doesn't do service to the site.
"The Imperial Citadel is where the Nguyen dynasty ruled from 1802 to 1945.
Inside the Citadel is the Imperial City within which is the Purple Forbidden City.
The whole complex, which is enclosed by a moat and a 2km x 2km brick wall occupies over 500 hectares. Between this wall and the Imperial City is a village of something like 9,000 people.
Unfortunately the majority of buildings inside the Imperial City were destroyed during the Vietnam war, so much of the grandeur was lost but there are still an impressive array to contemplate.
This is not an attraction you can see in a short space of time - allow a few hours, preferably with a knowledgeable guide to get the best out of your time there.
A must see."
Nice play to visit. Jan is a raining season. Hotel and food is nice and good. We stayed in Midtown hotel
It's really big and frankly quite boring. There are very little materials describing in details what are you looking at.
"Most interesting to learn about these Emporers from so far back that ruled with impunity. Incredible how these huge palaces were built with such perfection and only basic tools available.
Then also, just too amazing to believe that he had 750 wives AND 500 concubines!!! Where on earth did he get the time ...... and energy to service this lot. Good heavens, whatta busy man!!! Then.... he had to rule at the same time giving advice and guidance to all the students of Confucius whom he tutored and examined.
Wow. I am in awe of this guy.
You must use a learned guide for these tours.
Use Unique Vietnam Tours. Speak to Lucy."
"The imperial town in Hue is the past residence of thw Vietnamese king, partly destroyed by the bombs during the war. Nice buildings, a place to visit if you are in Hue"
"Visited on a rainy day. First building once inside has a must-watch video explaining the complex, but there's not much information elsewhere (fairly typical of historic sites in Vietnam it seems...). Gate and emperor's temple are worth seeing, but the rest is pretty average - huge areas of empty space were buildings used to be. Worth a visit nonetheless."
"Even on a rainy day the visit was great. So much history in one place! Quite in the beginning, after zou see the throne of Nyugen family, there is a possibility to see the movie about Hue - the palace and the royal family. The movie is very interesting, brief overview of what is going on - highly recommendable. After that you just get lost around and enjoy the feeling of being in the forbidden city. On the walls you can read a lot about history of the imperial family and their laws."
This is a wonderful site to visit! Full of history and Vietnamese culture. Pity that most people who visit Danang ignore this amazing site. It is a long day trip (2.5h drive each way) but totally worth it. Highly recommended
"Imperial city is a great site, everything in Hue is relatively pricier than Vietnam 100k VND per person) but still some great history and beautiful buildings. Don't be intimidated, you can walk the whole site in 1.5hr if you are committed. You don't need a tuktuk or guide, easy to get about."
Our driver Vinh we booked from Villa Louise took us everywhere on a full day tour. Highly recommend him. Very patient and affection driver.
"We did a day tour by motor bike ($15US from our hotel). The combined entry ticket cost VND 280000 and included 2 other sites ( the emperors tombs). Some trip advisor reviews have stated this to be much lower but are incorrect. I believe that there is a lower price for Vietnamese Nationals and a higher price for foreigners - resistance was futile! Regardless, it is still cheaper to buy the combined ticket, than buying them all separately.
The grounds within the walls of the citadel are more extensive than you might imagine. Allow yourself at least an hour. Some fascinating old photographs here and an interesting DVD just inside the entry."
"as title.. it's a must to visit this place. Even if it was a very rainy day it has been exiting to visit the pavilions and to stroll around. it is a masterpiece, really well preserved and worth a visit."
"What a pleasant experience to walk along the perimeter and parameters if this citadel. A cleverly built palace protected by huge moats and an awesome mix of restored and unrestored buildings in the grounds...all with a purpose and a story to tell. Have you ever wondered why there are three entrances ? In those days of course the King used the main and his subjects the other two. Unfortunately there is no access permissible to get a viewing from the top. But to tour the citadel wearing ""the hat of a King "" is enough to capture the spirit of what life must have been as a sovereign in ancient times. Every pillar , every ceiling, every wall., every passage ! Every room ALL told an incredible story. There's even the theatre built and pictures of musicians and artefacts to show how music was also much appreciated by the King ."
"Must visit! I almost got lost in there. Even the rain could spoil the great walk. The ticket is little bit overpriced, but anyway it is worth it."
"we've visited the citadel with a vietnamese guide, on a rainy afternoon. 3 hours were more than enough, to cover everything - the guide spent cca 1 hour with us, then we continued on our own. Guide service costs 150000d and we'd recommend it (although in our case the guide's English was rather rusty and she wasn't extremely keen on answering our questions) we've seen better ones on the way, but one cannot really chose only according to the language. a good tip: you can use the ticket for 3 or 4 sites (one of which is the citadel, other 2 or 3 are tombs of emperors) over 2 days, which might be convenient, if arriving to Hue at lunchtime and impossible to make it all in one day 😉"
Okay but in bad shape. Saw graffiti and displays that are broken. If tourism is important to hue they need to step it up and clean up the imperial city and its gardens and sidewalks and displays.
The Citadel dominates the centre of Hue. We travelled here as part of an organised tour group so it was great to be provided with some information about the sight as part of our visit. It is quite a large complex so was nice to wander through the entire complex as part of our visit. It was a bit of a shame that it was drizzly rain for our visit but apparently that is to be expected for this time of year. Definitely worth a visit!
Just visit it's awesome. Takes your breath away with the history. Slowly being restored but in a funny way it's good to see the ruins as you get a sense of what it must have been like.
"Such and impressive place to visit and sad that it didn't survive the Tet Offensive of 1968.... there are bullet holes in most of the original walls, but I feel they add to the history.
They are working hard to restore much of the buildings, but it will never reach the glory of pre 1968. Cheap to enter and full of moats, ponds, buildings, walls and historic information. I loved it a lot more than the Forbidden City in Beijing even though it was missing 80% of the buildings.
Must see!"
We visited here in the afternoon and found the grounds of the Palace to be very beautiful. The history here is impressive. Should be part of everyone's itinerary if they come to Vietnam.
"Very fascinating
If possible hire a local guide for the Citadel, they have a lot of knowledge and once inside you will realize that other groups are large and you can barely see everything. In a small group with local guide it is much easier. Ask for the local guide at the entrance counter"
"This site is pretty amazing. However I wish a map was included in the ticket price or at least the option to purchase one. An issue we have come across in most sites around Vietnam as the only other option is to hire a guide, do a tour or cart the Lonely Planet guide with you. I could have spent more time exploring this site if it wasn't for the wet weather we had. They are doing up some of the sites and/or reconstructing them. I can't help think the site will gradually loose it's authenticity and become a tourist trap (well bigger one)."
It's not worth the money at all it's just a few paths to walk around there are no real good buildings here!
"Require fair amount of walking unless you opt for a paid buggy ride. Once inside the walled palace, you still have to walk. Good overview of ancient architectural design akin to Chinese. Many professional photographers will snap a picture without your permission and print it into a scroll and try to sell you when you leave."
"This is the most stunning monument to the Vietnam war. Only 20 or so of the original 75+ buildings remain thanks to relentless American bombing during the conflict. The parts that have not yet been restored are a truly fitting memorial to the terrible Tet Offensive battle; some 5000 troops died on each side and the walls still hold the bullet holes from the vicious fighting.

You could easily lose an entire day here.

Make sure you go round with a good guide - I can recommend Tours from Hue as the best!"
"This was interesting to learn about the history.
Some great architecture and beautiful gardens.
If you have kids - pay the 5000 dong and feed the fish..... they get into a feeding frenzy the kids will love."
"Impressive site good to walk a Around
Beautiful
It is the most important visit in hue
Possibility of shuttle inside to avoid walking"
"Although it's been so wet. We still decided to make the most of it and visit the citadel.

If you don't have a tour guide I would recommend going into the very first building as you come in to watch the video that tells you what everything is and a bit about it.

I wouldn't recommend doing it on a wet day as we didn't appreciate it as much as I'm sure we would have on a sunny day.

A lot of restoration still going on but still enough to see and look around. Very impressive as it's absolutely massive!"
"To be honest I went to Hue for the food, which was great, and to escape the Canadian winter, a great decision even in Hue's rainy December climate. So being in Hue it is kind of an obligation to visit The Citadel. The most impressive site to me was the Emperor's receiving hall and, no doubt, that was the intent. Unfortunately visitors are not allowed to take photos, but you can take photos of everything else once you pass through the hall and enter the very large complex.

The complex was a mix of well preserved 1800s empirical buildings, rubble from buildings destroyed during the wars, and buildings undergoing restoration. Perhaps it was the rainy weather, but I just wasn't that impressed by my visit to The Citadel."
Quite remarkable that this city was still in use in the last century. Much of it is destroyed but it is still very beautiful with lots to see. The history and the stories of all the empires and the way the system operated was fascinating.
"We visited this as part of a trip to the tombs around Hue, finishing at the Imperial Citadel. The citadel isn't as polished as other temple or palace complexes I've seen and is quite dilapidated in places, but this adds to the interest and charm. The complex is big enough to spend several hours wandering about, and there is some information at the start, although the visiting system is a little chaotic! Well worth a visit though, definitely one of the best attractions in Hue, and is very easy to get to, being in the centre of town, and not expensive!"
Just wandering around the Citadel takes you back in time. Loved spending a few hours poking around here. Definitely worth a visit.
"From the descriptions I read on the web ,it sounded as if there are only ruins and not much to see. The areal is huge with lots of structures.

It is not so bad. Many buildings are restored and works go on. May be for professionals it creates a problem as the structures are not authentic. Make sure to go with a tour guide as otherwise you miss a lot. It is not layed out for a westerner's visit and although there are English plates the stories of the Kings and the way they lived are better to hear. If you like to dive into history plan for up to 3 hours. It is big."
Guide system disorganised. But the imperial city itself is interesting and worth a visit. Interesting too see the damage done by war and hear about the history of the emperors.
"My husband and I went with a guide to The Imperial City. It was amazing, so much history we never learned in American schools.

I highly recommend going with a guide or down loading a tour on your phone. The benefit of a guide is, of course, someone to answer questions.

It's a must see when visiting Hue."
Gave a good insight into life in during the Imperial period. A must see site during your tour of Hue.
The cost to visit is 150'000 vnd and it might be a little steep but it's worth it on a sunny day. Definitely skip it one rainy day because being soaked doesn't add to the enjoyment. It was a nice composition of the remaining buildings but in regards to information I think they could do more to give the maximum amount of detail to the visitors. Spend time walking around you'll find some interesting things to see.
"This impressive and vast area secured by walls and accessible through a limited number of gates reminds somewhat of the Forbidden City in Beijing (However much smaller and still in the renovation phase for a large number of buildings). It is a must however when visiting Hué and to avoid the large number of tourist arriving by busses, try to plan your visit around noon when all tourist are having lunch. It allows you to enjoy the buildings and take pictures without being disturbed"
"We liked this, wander at your own pace around amazing buildings, and easy to spend three hours
Not easy for handicapped persons lots of steps and door buffers
Reccomended to do"
Fascinating and so glad they are renovating. Make sure you enter at the only entrance NGO mon gate nearest to the Huong river as the other gates are exits only.
"This was our second site in Hue. It is a large Citadel, 2 km by 2 km. Though it was November it was hot, and we saw most of the major palaces in the Citadel.
The palace with all the kings was very interesting, but no photography. There was a set of spears which we have a fully size copy at home. I tried to photograph them, but was unable to do so because of the staff presence.
It was sad to see so many of the palaces had been damaged, or lost, some during the US-Vietnam war."
"Felt like we were lost in the Citadel. It is such a huge complex that you should not visit without on site guide. It is great to see and touch on bricks, bonsai, watching the relics dated long ago which connect to 13 Nguyen dynasties. Wearing royal costumes is really cool."
Loved this place ... but definitely get a guide or read up before you go! So much to know and there is no information there I. English!
"Maybe the expectation was too high, but we try to visit the Imperial City without guide... No map available at ticket office... No direction signs and few explanation table. Really difficult to follow the complex structure of the city. A lot of ruins and temples to be restored.
I hope in the next future it will be restored and well organized."
"We liked it and it was worth spending 3 hours. There are around 6-7 complexes to visit, the rest are getting restored over time. The entrance fee is okay."
"Hello everyone

Sorry but with all the hype this was all in all a disappointing place to visit. There is nothing much to see and alot of stone rubble lies around everywhere. The best place though is the bonsai garden in the north east.

Regards"
"It is a walled fortress and palace, part of the ancient city of Hue, which was a capital city of the Nguyen Dynasty. Hence, it is the major attraction in Hue. 13 emperors had stayed in this ancient citadel. The building architectures are typically eastern - palaces, courtyards, gardens, temples, pavilions, etc. Having a guide is essential to appreciate the history and layout of the various structures and buildings.

The complex is huge and needs lots of walking to explore the site. Depending on one’s interest, 1 to 2 hours are required to explore this historical site."
"It Was destroyed almost everything after the war even then king's home - where the king have sex with a lot, a lot a lot his wives. And a lot of building in the mix design of western.
But at dawn, the Imperial was shined very beautiful. We love that moment so bad. You should try to visit from 5-6 pm."
"I read that the weather in Hue was often rainy, and it lived up to its reputation in Dec. Still, the Citadel was quite beautiful in the misty rain. There is a less visited corner of the Citadel--off to the left from the coffee shop--where tour groups, of which there are an enormous number, don't go. So, it is quieter and the temples, etc. have a more intimate and amazing beauty. When I was there, parts of the Citadel grounds were flooded, giving the place an eerie beauty.
I gave the place about two hours plus, visiting the less visited areas, stopping for a smoothie, etc. Tours probably spend an hour.
I walked from my hotel to the Citadel, at least 20 minutes, across the river, but as one nears the site, one will be constantly accosted by cyclo-rickshas, so it is easy to get a ride if one wishes.
Pack a cheap poncho. Most hotels will loan umbrellas, but ponchos are more useful."
"We spent an hour and a half touring the imperial city but we could have spent much longer there. The palace is beautiful and the buildings are painted in royal colors. There is not a huge amount of stuff to see in Hue so if you're there, this is definitely worth checking out!"
The citadel is just across the river of the main town. I recommend to get a tour guide to get a better understanding of the historic site.
"We toured this our first morning in Hue, and enjoyed walking through the large area. It is definitely a must-see while in Hue. Our only critique would be that although they provide a map of the site, they do not indicate which parts are closed for restoration, or a suggested order of visit."
"The Imperial City is still wonderful and you can only imagine how stunning it was back in the day. It is a huge complex, in need of more restauration. But absolutely stunning. And take a guide, it is worth it!"
It is a very beautiful place but very wet in December. It is a very cultural and the history lesson for kids was worth all the walking.
"Did not realise how big it was and could have spent longer than the 1.5 hours we had. Our 8 year old enjoyed dressing up (90,000 vnd and then 150,00 if you want a picture) and feeding the fish (5,000).

Definitely worth a visit."
So much to see but so much work to do. At least half a day wondering around. Many former magnificent buildings either gone from war damaged disrepair. But still plenty see and appreciate
"Depending on your interest in history, architecture, or gardens, this could be a 1 hour visit or a full day.
We have relatively disinterested teens, so it was 1-2 hours for us. Even though this place is not ancient, it's still a cool place to go for a 1/2 day and walk around.
We did not get a guide, just used the signage and lonely planet book. That was enough for people who want a low key visit. It also nice to just get away from the traffic!"
This place was magic even tho it was teeming. Well worth getting one of the excellent English-speaking guides. B
This place has so much to see. I found the imperial city to be breathtaking and very impressive. Naked sure to have some good walking shoes and to be careful because areas of the ground are uneven or falling apart. Be careful and enjoy what the citadel has to offer.
"the place is amazing and big enough to spend like 2 hours to explore. even its not very old (almost 200 years) but got stories to tell and gardens, statues, tombs and palace are great. price was 150k for foreigner (120 for local) and it totally worth it. the only problem i can mention is surprisingly there is no map given to visitors‌(its a big area so you gonna need a map assist you) also some places miss sign or signs dont provide enough information. overall it was great, i really enjoyed it."
Fascinating tour of the restored city which was totally pulverized by the US armed force. Viet Cong troops stayed outdoors in the city accepting the Americans would not devastate the old castle. They weren't right! A few structures now reproduced and ideally more will take after. Propose you google Hue hostile before visit to perceive how terrible it was.
"Although the Citadel was virtually destroyed in the Vietnam War, much of it has been rebuilt by UNESCO. You need at least half a day to truly appreciate what is the and I'd re moment a guide (Stop & Go tours being excellent)"
We went on a sunny and breezy day. The place was large it took us 1.5 hrs to browse around. Many areas still renovating but worth the visit!
"You should visit when in Hue! On the off chance that you additionally visit the tombs you can better purchase a multi ticket then It's less expensive! Decent space to stroll in. Be that as it may, will most likely be more pleasant with great climate."
The Imperial city is within easy walking distance from central Hue and provides hours of things to see. I think tours were offered - though I chose to just make my own way around. Many of the buildings have been renovated but it has an authentic feel - definitely the best attraction in Hue!
"Unfortunately, it was a rainy day so we couldn't properly admire the citadel. We knew the place closed at 5.30, so at 5 we started rushing around. However, 5.30 is actually code for 5.15 and as we were entering one of the final sights we realized we were almost locked in. The rain was pouring and every door had a lock!! Finally we found an opening and bumped into a guy with a bike that pointed us to the exit. We had to walk across the whole citadel to get to a side exit. It was ridiculous and a bit scary."
"Fantastic ... I cannot say a lot more, but if you care at all about history of this country, from occupations by various nations and the Kings that ruled Vietnam for centuries, this is a must see"
"An interesting historic site to walk around. It cost 150,000VND to get in. Many of the buildings have been renovated or repainted but there are many photographs lining the walkways to show you what life here used to be like.

Surprisingly good on a rainy day since many of the walkways are covered and you can go in most of the buildings. Just watch out for slippery floors."
"The citadel is the star site in the city. You will either want to know some background before you go or have a knowledgeable guide. The imperial palace complex gives insight into how the Nguyen rulers lived.

Although the complex lost many buildings during the war, there is enough intact/restored to impress and interest any traveler with an interest in history."
"no idea why this is UNESCO having been to other UNESCO sites around the globe (UK, EU, USA, China, Japan). vietnam has the worse UNESCO sites i've ever visited. this citadel was built in form and copied from the chinese forbidden city in beijing (remember vietnam was chinese colony for 1000 years). if you want to see an ancient forbidden city then please just go to china. anything touted as ""ancient"" in vietnam will only be maybe 100-300 years old and in chinese architecture style (basically youll be looking at chinese buildings in vietnam but on a much more impressive scale). only visit if this is your first east asian visit. if you have been to china, this will be boring and unimpressive. also there are no english signage or map explaining any historical information or what the buildings were used for so good luck walking around randomly looking at basically ruins and buildings falling apart, leaking water and super slippery if it is raining."
"If you are interested in history this might be for you. They say it takes approx 2 hours to walk around, we were there maybe 45 min before we got a bit bored. Would help if they gave you a map when buying tickets, as this place is huge. Would probably be more interesting with a guide."
Part of our day tour and I was surprised by how huge and spread out it was. Thank goodness our guide knew his way around and the best parts to see.
"Fascinating tour of the rebuilt city which was almost completely destroyed by the US army.
Viet Cong troops camped in the city assuming the Americans would not destroy the old palace.
They were wrong!
Some buildings now reconstructed and hopefully more will follow.
Suggest you google Hue offensive before visit to see how bad it was."
So it rained continually the entire time I was in Hue but still managed a morning here. It is predominantly outside so expect to get wet if its raining but worth the visit
"My husband and I wandered around the Citadel for hours even on a wet day... the architecture, the history, the exquisite beauty of this place is more than worth your time and money. We didn't use a guide and still learned a lot. Also nearby are old tanks and aircraft from the American war which you should definitely check out. Beware scam artists nearby who will try to tell you the site is closed and try to get you to go with them to other sites. Definitely go here if you go to Hue!"
"I thought this was a brilliant insight as to how the emperors would have lived. I enjoyed imagining them walking through this truly grand palace in the old days. However a few hours and I was done. Great to see, shouldn't be missed if in Hue."
"Lets be honest, there are lots of things to see in Vietnam and this is not one of them.

Or plane was delayed and we got to our hotel at 3pm, having only 1 night in Hue we were determined to see the main attraction. We headed off in the drizzle and bought tickets with 1.5 hours to explore the Citadel.

As the rain grew heavier, it became harder to explore. The tickets are pricey and the funds do not seem to be going towards the restoration of this place. A lot of the area was flooded and muddy that we couldn't walk.

We were looking to leave 30 mins before closing time however the entrance we came in from was closed and had to walk an extra 10 mins to find another exit. The whole area was deserted and i was terrified about being locked in. Being a tourist and coming out at a different exit to where we had entered disoriented us and we ended up getting lost in the city. There was no one to guide us out.

Ok if you have nothing else to see or explore in Hue but definitely not worth the money or in the rain. I have seen better things in Vietnam during my visit."
"We visited the Citadel with a tour guide which was essential, otherwise we wouldn't have understood anything!

It is so vast and there is so much to see that it really was a whistle-stop tour. I wish we could have had another hour tagged on the end to wander around on our own at a more leisurely pace.

The history and architecture is amazing. The buildings are a little dilapidated in places and some renovation work underway but it doesn't detract. Many of the outer walls are completely black but I guess cleaning such old stonework is not an option.

If you are there on a rainy day beware of slippery surfaces. Many of the stones have moss growing on them which become very slippery when wet. Also, you will have to remove your shoes two or three times to enter buildings, so wear something which is easy to take off.

Thoroughly enjoyed the visit."
To bad so much is destroyed and the finest parts reconstructed so it doesn't feel that genuine.. but still a must see when visiting Hue.
"Forget the tombs and pagodas, if you do one thing in Hue it should be the Imperial Palace grounds. Some of the buildings are ruined, but the remaining and restored buildings are beautiful and distinctivrly Vietnamese. Several exhibits and lots of photographs and plaques offer background information for the palace grounds. 150k admission, 10k motorbike parking by the east (exit) gate."
"An amazing mix of history and beauty. We spent 3 hours here and didn't even get to it all.
It was a wet and gloomy day however this didn't take away from the stunning architecture and gardens within the city.
Could have spent heaps for time there."
"Historically interesting, but there's not much left to be seen and what remains seems not very well maintained.

Still, it is a must see if you are interested in the imperial history of Vietnam.
Some of the displays have a lot of background information on the emperors of Vietnam."
I felt quite disappointed when I was at the citadel maybe because I thought it'd look much better and that there'd be more to see. However the citadel is very much ruined. The more you walk inwards into the citadel the more this is clear. So I'd suggest going with lower expectations. Didn't have time to go to the antiques museum and in fact forgot to go for it. I recommend going there by cab as it's cheap to do so - cabbed from hotel.
"This is a must see in Hue. Even though the site has been devastated by two major wars with the French and later the Americans, it is still impressive. The sheer size of the site is impressive. The buildings that remain and are being reconstructed are impressive. Count on spending at least a day here - two days is better. Take a hat and lots of water, particularly in the hotter weather. Be prepared to be impressed."
We loved this place. As a family lots to see they have restored alot and there was lots of information in English so no guide needed.
Great experience to walk around ancient Emperor. Many constructions were in ruins due to Bomb in the air from US army. That's a pity. Still reconstruction work keep going. Hopefully we can see it's full views in future.
I'am walking in the rain to see how the Vietnamese King lives in the old time. They are remodeling the place to keep it longer for tourists to come.
"Outside walls and original parts are worth seeing but most of the city was destroyed so what's here is mostly heavily renovated. Still interesting but we paid for a guide and without him we wouldn't have had any idea what were looking at.
Worth a look but better temples etc in Cambodia by a long way.."
"This is a wonderful piece of Vietnamese history well worth seeing and preserving. We would like to see it being renovated in time but it's so vast, would cost a lot of money. You can spend an hour walking around or half a day as there are many different parts to see. Sadly, when we went it was raining so we didn't spend as much time as we would of had the weather have been dry."
This place is wayyy too big to be covered but we tried anyways within 1.5H. Follow the tour-guide if you don't want to be lost!
"I visited the citadel on a very rainy day, and my opinion of the citadel is a little bit mixed. First of all, you mostly wander around outside which is not that enjoyable in the rain, and a lot of the buildings are replica's of the real thing, which was mostly destroyed during the war.

It was quite cool to imagine what the place must have been like in its heyday, although a guide would probably make this imagination a lot wilder than my guidebook could. Im not sure I saw everything (a guide would make sure of that) but I didn't really care at that point because I was absolutely soaked. Overall, my personal visit was alright, but a guide and some good weather would probably make it great!"
"Interesting history as usual with Vietnam. We went on a heavily rainy day and it made it less pleasant - wading through puddles and requiring shoes to come off in temples results in you unable to visit a few locations in the citadel. If it is raining, definitely pick up a local poncho for a couple thousand dong. A raincoat and umbrella might not be enough"
"Lots of buildings and temples to explore.
The old Queen's Residence was lovely.
Take your own water in and water inside is very expensive!
Some parts under repair."
"Even on a rainy day the city was awesome. Watch out for the slippery tiles, just make sure you have good rubber soles- no ballerina slippers for this walk! We hired a guide who made the history even come more alive - in an already rich history. I could go on- however will let the numerous pictures tell the story ( much more eloquently)."
"Very nice, even in a very rainy day. It was difficult to go around , but it's steel the most important in Hue town."
"Much of the citadel remains in ruins and is in need of renovation. But it is a vast site, with scores of ruins. Difficult to get round to see everything - and I found after about 90 minutes, I had had enough."
"My boyfriend and I visited the citadel on an incredibly rainy day. However, despite the weather we agreed it was definitely a worthwhile experience. Not only does the palace and the surrounding buildings provide an excellent glimpse into the imperial history of Vietnam but also sheds light on just how devastating the war was on the city itself. Behind the reconstructed buildings were remains of what could not be salvaged, most of which were blackened with napalm and riddled with bullet holes. Even some of the main structures had visible bullet holes in them. We would have liked to explore more but the weather was terrible and we were sodden through. Definitely worth seeing!"
"Interesting could have been fantastic if I hadn't been cheap.

That being said, I liked it. The bathrooms could be more numerous. Plan accordingly."
"You could spend hours wondering around. Possibly the best site to visit in Hue. It was raining through our stay but stopped for the 2 hours we spent wondering, a must see if in town."
"Interesting to see how the Emperor lived. Was a bit pagoda/mausoleum/palaced out by the time we got there so it didn't grip me. The Americans had bombed it so His Highness's house had gone. The Emperor on his throne was shielded from 'common' people by a smoke urn, so they never saw him. He had his own theatre - he had the front row and the audience came in after him so they didn't see his face! Sad. Bet he didn't travel Economy."
"Though still in need of extensive restoration after the damage decades of war had left, the Citadel and Palace are a serene oasis in Hue. Especially if one rises up early and gets there before most of the large, organized tours. Like much of the history I found that there was a dearth of information available at the location though the signage here is better than some.
Take your time and find some of the unusual camera angles available along the walls and across the vase terraces here. On a rainy day you get the shine of water on the tiles and the glisten on the leaves."
"Horrible ticket office. We bought the tickets and then the lady who sold them to us caught up with us at the entrance and demanded we buy new tickets at a higher price, since the ones we had were not valid for whatever reason. Lucky enough, we got a refund and left."
"We had a great time here - approximately 2-3 hours in total. Stunning place. We booked a tour guide at the ticket booth for 150,000 vdn for one hour. Best decision ever. Turns out there's hardly information about what you're seeing and it's easy to get lost. Our guide gave us the juicy ins and outs of the kings who lived here as well as expertly guiding us around pointing out what we need to see. Without her it would have been frustrating to be honest as you have no idea what you're looking at. Her stories made it very interesting!"
"My partner and I visited the citadel on a very rainy day in Dec.

If you come to Hue, you have to visit the citadel. It's massive, filled with history, and nicely kept. I liked it especially for the history it holds from the Vietnam war - the old walls still show bullet holes and other scars from that war.

Unfortunately we visited in the pouring rain. Even in our ponchos it was all a bit miserable. Additionally, the old paths that link the buildings together were EXTREMELY slippery. So we had to walk slowly around in the sideways rain, making us even more drenched. This place would be lovely in the sunshine, however."
"We spent about an hour here with a guide and saw the main points. I would recommend spending a few hours to explore leisurely. Impressive historic buildings, pretty gardens and water features."
Spent an hour and a half immersed in the beautiful imperial city. It's really a gem in Hue. Should not miss it. It's a pity that it's raining so the moving around is kinda difficult without rain coats and umbrellas.
This is quite a large complex which we didn't particularly enjoy there really isn't anything exceptional here having said that if you are in hue you might as well visit . A tip they don't allow you to exit from the same point as the entrance despite there being a number of exit points and you may find yourself walking all the way back across the main concourse to the rear exit and then walking around the perimeter wall back to the entrance point this would be ok if you knew this in advance but there is not a sign to that effect at the entrance there are however signs saying exit!! We did as several others did and just walked out by the entrance point ignoring the gesticulations of a security guard -
"Part of the reason me and my friend came to Vietnam was because we were interested by its history and this was one of the main things we wanted to see, we weren't disappointed.

The Imperial City itself is so big and there's so much to see, we came late so didn't manage to see it all but we still spent a few hours there.

The entry fee is fairly expensive (150,000 Dong) but we thought it was worth it. You can pay extra for a guided tour but we wanted to look around by ourselves.

Some of the buildings are really spectacular and the history behind it all is very interesting, there's videos and posters explaining all about each area and what it was used for, although some of it still damaged and currently being renovated

If you want to see some amazing buildings and learn some facts about the Nguyen dynasty then I highly recommend going, we thought it was worth it."
"Just spent 3 hours wandering around in the Imperial City. Really really beautiful! Took way too many photos. Colours are just beautiful in this partly cloudy and damp weather.

Afterwards we enjoyed papaya juice, beer, hamburger and fried squid at Geylangs. Good food and friendly service."
"This place is definitely worth a visit, as both the history of the place and the restored architecture are fascinating. We only spent about 90 minutes there and felt like we had seen most of it. There were actually some very serene sections, such as the gardens - nice to experience in the hustle and bustle of Hue."
"Great to see & bike around and enjoy. Not super old but still beautifully. They only should put some lights on the wall at the evenings, would give pretty pictures."
"First up we visited in the pouring rain with 2 teenagers so that out a dampener on things. Would be much better strolling on a fine day than dashing about from portico to portico in rain ponchos. It's a big area but there are no signs or directions or information to know really what you're looking at or where you are in the complex. The Korean funded video in the throne hall helps get the old layout but from there you're on your own. There was no food available inside the enclosure as we'd heard - so the teens could only take so much wandering and wondering where we were and how to get to the few buildings standing before we had to refuel. It's an amazing place with amazing history - we just couldn't access it. We did stumble on the Queen Mothers temple space which was intact and neat to go upstairs. It's unclear if you can take photos or not. We didn't, but many people were and then guards would randomly shout at people - so the etiquette isn't clear. Some of the photos of the last Emperors and imperial life are amazing. It feels like an educational opportunity waiting to happen."
We came down the Perfume River by boat and they dropped me off here. This is a hugely impressive set of structures showing a range of architecture with a wide range of uses. I didn't have a guide so all I really have are impressions of the place. The size of it struck me and in its heyday it clearly gave the population a clear sense of where the power lay. The renovation work that has been done and is ongoing is hugely impressive and will add a great deal to the enjoyment of the visit when complete. Definitely a highlight of our trip.
"If you're in Hue then you're probably here to visit this, and it's definitely worth the trip. It's a cool area with interesting historical buildings. Only downside is that some information plaques are dated and you're unable to read the information on them, and some buildings are mid-renovation."
"When we visited it was raining season, so we could walk without sun shine. It was good choice to learn about Vietnam history."
Peaceful and calm place. You can feel the history from there. Quite sad that most of the monuments has been destroied during the Vietnamese war.
You must visit when in hue! If you also visit the tombs you can better buy a multi ticket then It's cheaper! Nice domain to walk in. But will probably be nicer with good weather.
Very impressive site boasting of beautiful ornaments and colours! We thoroughly enjoyed our visit with our tour guide !
"Great place to visit, very interesting and beautiful architecture. Great for everyone kids and adults"
"Big day of walking - see the historic imperial citadel and learn about the 13 emperors of Vietnam.
Do this with a guide or it's not as easy to appreciate and it will all kind of look the same.
The area at the back where the mothers and grandmothers lived, and also the gardens that were reading/leisure areas were our highlights as they had beautiful Chinese style bridges, small streams and trees. Very relaxing between the temples and palaces."
"Be prepared to spend a half day here. Surprisingly it was not as crowded as expected. The further away from the entrance the less people. Some form of guide is neccesary, we used a description in Lonely Planet. Tickets are available at the entrance and are a bargain by North American standards. Food and drinks are available inside."
"Badly destroyed in the last century, this extensive and impressive site is now being restored. Similar in many ways to Beijing's forbidden city, but with many of the buildings awaiting restoration."
Even though when we visited this it was raining extremely hard it was still very enjoyable. Lots to see and well worth getting wet for.
This is probably the most important place to see in Hué. But it takes you at least half a day to see almost everything at this place...
I highly recommend having a guide to see this wonderful place. Plenty of detail here with lots of photo opportunities.
"The imperial city of Hué is the main attraction in this city.
It's definitely worth a visit and you can easily spend at least 2 hours there and take great pictures of an historical site."
"If you go to Hue you can' t miss it!!
It only takes approximately one hour to visit it and you can do it on your own. The ticket is really cheap.
Go around 4/5 pm during the sunset and you'll appreciated it much more!!!!
It's a very gorgeous place!!!!"
So much history in this beautiful place and so much conflict. Our guide told us all about the many buildings and the kings who lived there. Sadly some have been destroyed.
"those who loves ancient history is a wonderful place. lice ancient Rome/ Kyoto. impotrat to keep it an give the chance for maintenance,"
"Unfortunate that the citadel was largely destroyed by war and was never restored to its previous glory. Wandering through what was left standing, one cannot help but heave a sigh of pity. Interesting photos along the long hallways. Our guide didn't bring us to see the real highlights... so don't miss out on the 9 dynasty urns, royal theatre, library and temples..."
"This is a big and nice park, but the buildings are in very bad condition and the mold is everywhere. There is no right documentation about the things you see, some documentation are only in vietnamese. You will find better photo motives in other places of vietnam."
If you are in Hue a visit to the Citadel is a must just so you can understand the way things were when Vietnam had a monarchy.
"A very large complex behind forbidding citadel walls. There is much history here, and much to learn and understand. We went with a guide, which was excellent. If you go, either go with a guide or take a good guide book with you."
Quite a sight. Unfortunately we went during the rainy season. The walk was manageable and we get to see different parts of the citadel. A good place to visit.
"Our tour guide/driver suggested we buy a combined entrance ticket which was great. The Citadel is an adventure in itself. It was very hot when we visited, so we kept inside and read most of the literature explaining each event/room. Impressive visit. Enjoyed live music by local performers within the Citadel."
"The Citadel, palace and some of he temples have been well restored. There's lots of good descriptions written about and a video in the main palace. We were there on a rainy day so I think my review might be a bit tainted :)"
"Despite the rain, we purchased the obligatory ponchos and still found the Imperial City fascinating. It would be especially enjoyable I'm sure in good weather. The city is impressive in size and as I write this after visiting the War Remnants museum on Ho Chi Minh I am saddened by the fighting and destruction that ensued inside the Imperial City during the Vietnam war. I was not aware of this while visiting.

Really enjoyed it and would love to have spent more time in better weather."
The emperor city has is charms and is a must see it do thing in Vietnam. One should at least spend half a day in and around the grounds. There are so many things to see. Best to be there before nine or after three o clock to avoid the crowds.
"A worthwhile visit to help understand the old imperial culture, and the great shift to today's Vietnam. Be sure to have comfortable shoes as you will do lots of walking."
"Clearly a fabulous palace in the past. Regrettably allowed to deteriorate over the last 50 years.
Still worth a visit."
Really enjoyable few hours in the rain. Lots of places to find shelter and a coffee in quiet corner. Taxi back to hotel easy to find and low-cost.
"It's a nice place to go, definitely worth a visit. A lot was bombed, so a lot of restauration still has to be done. Also, make sure to not go when it'a raining; literally half of the city gets flooded."
"We were in amazement of how large the ground of the Imperial City were. Many of the buildings were restored and some were in the process of being restored. Unfortunately due to many wars many buildings were partially or completely destroyed. None the less this site is quite interesting, and should be on your list of sites to visit when in Hue."
"Exceptionally intriguing visit. We did a one day excursion to the Citadel consolidated with the Royal Tombs, Thien Mu Pagoda and lunch on a pontoon on the Perfume River. You ought to permit 2+ hours at the Citadel. The tombs of Tu Duc and Ming Mang are definitely justified even despite a visit."
"It must have been grand when new. You can still see how impressive it was from the restorations they are doing. the wars have destroyed parts of it, and there is never enough money for all the temple restorations going on. But it is well worth the visit."
"A must see! But take at least 3 hours to see this place. To see all of it, make it a days outing. There is much to explore and most exhibits are interactive and not behind glass or ropes. The history is vast and humbling. Definitely don't miss this one!"
"Some beautiful buildings and gardens lie within the Imperial City.
It is a large area, so be prepared for some walking. Stunning statues and architecture. Those that were not destroyed during the American-Vietnam War are well maintained and stunning.
A great opportunity to learn a little about the history of Vietnamese people and how the Emperors ruled."
"150k viet dong per adult per entry, outside cyclo will cost about 5 Usd to 1 Usd just to cycle around the outer wall which is quite pointless for an hour. Just enter to the Imperial City, turn left, there is a small lane leading to a cafe, which you can take a break have a small bite, if not you might like to book a shuttle buggy to tour the whole Imperial City within.

It cost 50k viet dong per adult for an hour ride but if you do not want to wait or share with other strangers, you can book the whole shuttle buggy for 300k viet dong for private use. It helps when your legs cannot take you far enough.

With that shuttle, it will drop and pick you to all the destinations within the Imperial City, just a driver, no guide provided. It tends to make the whole trip alot easier, especially for the elderly folks under the hot sun.

The imperial city is quite run down, not really that interesting, the only well kept place will be the theatre which they do have daily performance, watch out for the timing, if not you will miss it."
Hire an English speaking guide on your way into the Citadel. The Citadel is huge so plan on few hours.
"Although most of the city has been rebuilt after being destroyed by war or typhoons, it is still a beautiful place full of amazing architecture and rich history.
It's absolutely massive though, so I would suggest getting a good tour guide to show you around and answer your questions.
(I highly recommend Thanh Van through Hue Urban Adventures)."
just visited 10 days back. Get to know a lot regarding history of vietnam and Nguyen Dynasty. We took about 2 and half hrs to explore the whole place. A lot of walk is required but worth visit. The remains are quiet well maintained.. A beautiful landscape and many beautiful gardens to roam around.
"150.000vnd is a bit mutch as entrance fee for the forbiden city. This especialy considering the state it's in. There is allot of renovation going on but i feel this is only done for its touristic value and less for its historical. Never the less, i whould stil recommend going if you are in the area."
we enjoyed the walk around and all the interesting features pluss the history would recommend to all visiting Vietnam to have a look your here so do it
"What a huge walled city this is, so big you don't realise that's what it is. The imperial palace is fascinating, it really is a must to have a very good tour guide to explain the history as there are numerous facts and stories to be heard. It made sense that to rule a country you should have the capital roughly mid point between north and south. This now being a world heritage site they really do need to get on with the restoration as parts are looking very worn and drab, which is a shame for such beautiful buildings."
"The citadel was interesting if you are into history but it can be done in a couple of hours. Without a tour guide you won't learn much as there is not much information here.

Much of the buildings are in ruin and look like they need repairing and the floors are very slippery and dangerous when wet so watch out.

It was massively overpriced for what it was compared to many other attractions we have seen. Staff are not friendly and just shout ""no photo!"" at you.

The bikes outside the city also are pests and do not know what ""no"" means even after telling them for a 5th time (no exaggeration)"
"Don't miss this historical site in Hue, (pronounced huwey?) once the capital of Vietnam before it was Vietnam, badly damaged in the wars in 1947 and 1968 and in a bit of disrepair. Walk the corridors which only emperors and empresses and eunuchs could walk. I'm sure glad I live now and didn't have to become an eunuch!!! Look at old black & white photographs of the Mandarins, warriors, officials, elephants, horses and of course, the Emperors and royal family.
Visit the Emperors reading room full of ornate carvings, exquisite if not uncomfortable looking furniture, the building beautifully decorated with ceramics in an particularly unique style.
Walk through the courtyards where Mandarins waited for an audience with the emperor, just feel & drink in the pure history of this special place.
Don't take any photos in the throne room even though you really really want to!!! A really beautiful ornately decorated place - the hand painted & lacquered columns gone black from too many people touching them.
Check out the Music Recital Hall, look at the displays then just sit in one of the ornate chairs, listen to the music & just imagine the emperor in the front row with his entourage and once again place yourself in the audience - one mistake by the lead electric triangle player could result in a trip to the barber!! I loved this place!! A must see when in Hue."
"After the Ngyugen's conquered the old dynasty with help from Napoleon they constructed a new city in Hue as their capital. Destroyed by French and American bombs, the Vietnamese have reconstructed many old buildings. While not the historical buildings, you get a real feel for what 19th and early 20th century life must have been."
"This was a neat site to walk around but not being into the nitty gritty history, I did find it overpriced for what it was. The pictures do say it all and if they excite you, worth a trip... if not, save the time and money. Also not recommended on rainy days."
This is a very impressive historical site. We (except the children ) thoroughly enjoyed walking around the Citadel and the Imperial Palace within the Forbidden City. The government needs to work hard to restore this historical landmark for the next generations. Our tour guide told us a lot of very interesting stories about the Citadel and about the history of Vietnam. So sad to hear that the citadel was partially destroyed during the wars
"You really should come here, even in the rain. If your a history buff it brings a little of Vietnam to life. I just love the architecture"
"Ancient place, impressive history.
We had a nice walk and with the right guide the story of this place becomes super interesting!
This was the only reason we came to hue."
"Very interesting piece of history, yet the stones and walkways were extremely slippery to the point of being dangerous as it was raining lightly the day we went. Otherwise would strongly recommend artists impressions on what the original view of each area might have been like next to what it was like before being refurbished. Again interesting place with possibilities yet to be explored..."
"If you're into Vietnam culture and history, you can't skip this.
Most part of the citadel was destroyed, but you can still have a glimpse of what it looked like."
"Lots of walking around for not a lot to see. I think there are a lot more interesting places to see in Vietnam. Namely because I've been to a lot of other places.
Also, the prices of this inside are astronomical compared to the outside.
For example an ice cream at normal price of 15,000 was 50,000 inside. That's almost a 200% mark up."
"The architecture is not the most impressive so to have a great experience you really should get a guide that explains you the history.
Compared to bai dinh pagoda wich was even for free near ninh binh i was not really impressed."
A very Interesting piece of history smack in the middle of big Hue. We didn't do a tour just entry tickets and walked around ourselves. Very old very interesting. Tours may be worth it as some of the signs are no longer readable but we had a good time on a budget!
Our guide took us here on our city tour. She did a good job explaining the site and its history. Big place so she took us to the highlights I guess. But you could easily spend several hours here.
When you are in Hue this is a must see. It is a very big area with a lot of different building. It gave us a good impression of the ancient town and how emperors were living!
My husband and I visited the Citadel with a guide and we believe that is the best way to get to know the place and its history. The site is vast with a lot of places to see.
It is good to take a walk in the enclosed walls. A lot of structures are still in ruins. Quite similar to Chinese palace in Beijing albeit smaller.
The Citadel of Hue is amazing. I've visited here for work many many times. I never lose the sense of wonder entering the Citadel. It is a privilege to be able to be a return visitor. My advice is yes you must visit the Imperial City. .. but you also must walk or cycle around the entire Citadel. There is so much to see and experience. Take your time. Linger. Enjoy. A very special World Heritage site
"This place is huge, absolutely huge. I have no idea how people are doing this in less than 2 hours. The history of this place is amazing, some of the old photographs gave me a completely new perspective of Vietnamese history.

We were there in the afternoon/evening, it closes at 6, but it was getting dark from about 5 and the place had no lights inside. It was very eerie walking about then, all the tourists had gone - it was like a ghost town, pretty cool."
"From the outside its an imposing presence but once inside make sure you've allowed enough time to fully explore this incredible piece of history. The restorations are slowly taking place but you can still get a feel for how grand it must have been in its glory days. Words cannot explain, you just have to go."
"A nice place to spend half a day and just explore different buildings at various degrees of destruction and reconstruction. Has some interesting displays and a good explanatory video near the entrance.

Its large enough to get a little lost and away from the rest of the tourists, especially in the botanical gardens section."
"this is just amazing , vast and atmospheric . To think how much damage was done during the war and what the restoration team have completed. Important to understand that much is a recreation mixed with restoration ."
"If you are in Hue, a stop at the Citadel is a must. The site (as of 2016) is being rebuilt/renovated so in the future should be even better. Just a word of warning to westerners, the Citadel is outside and can be very hot. Be sure to bring plenty of water to stay hydrated! Worst case scenario there are plenty of vendors selling bottled water for around 15-20kVND"
Nice for spending a few hours walking around. Entrance fee is 150k dong so cheap enough for the few hours you can spend wandering around the grounds. There are a few nice gardens and we brought a lunch with us and enjoyed it in the peace and quite of one of them.
"Very interesting visit. We did a one day trip to the Citadel combined with the Royal Tombs, Thien Mu Pagoda and lunch on a boat on the Perfume River. You should allow 2+ hours at the Citadel. The tombs of Tu Duc and Ming Mang are well worth a visit."
"For me this a 'must see' on any trip to Hue, if not all of Vietnam. It conveys so much of the history and culture of Vietnam and, considering the damage inflicted on it during the American War is in fine condition. The authorities deserve the highest praise for the ongoing restoration work. I found it an easy walk around, it is a large site, and was able to get away from the large guided tour groups. It has enough shelter to dodge the inevitable Hue downpours. Recommended."
A very interesting place to visit if you are interested in Vietnamese history. It is being restored after the war to its original condition. Well worth a visit.
"Marvelous preserved piece of ancient history. Lots of carvings and interpretive exhibits. This is a huge place requiring lots of walking. Great gardens, but explanations of what you are viewing would best be suited to a guide."
This site was actually both athletically pleasing to wander around and interesting to learn about. Certainly recommend.
"We visited the Citadel as part of a Wendy Wu escorted tour. The site is vast with a lot more to see than the Forbidden City in Beijing. Keep in mind though that there was a lot of damage done during the Vietnam War. The restoration work is slow but painstaking. We spent 2 hours in the Citadel, which is just about enough time to see the main parts. You could easily spend a whole day here but be prepared for a lot of walking."
"The imperial city itself is interesting from a historical perspective but there is much restoration work being done and, unless you wish to pay extra for a tour guide, does not provide much information other than a short introductory video. We did not find the need to spend much time there and the majesty is slightly ruined by all the gift shops.

Also a warning: After being harassed by cyclists drivers around the citadel we eventually decided to hire a local man called Mr Hoa.

For our cycle ride around the city he seemed pleasant and friendly enough. He then asked about our travel plans South and then insisted the best way to do this was to take a motorbike tour with him. He had a business card for ""Friendly Motorbike Tours"" and his phone number 0914 540 565.

I had heard great things about the motorbike tours from Hue to Hoi An and he showed us a book of written reviews from fellow travelers and pictures he had taken. It looked great and, due to how pleasant he seemed, we thought perhaps we would give him the chance.

When we said we wished for time to think he seemed very disappointed. We assured him we would call him with our decision.

After debating amongst ourselves we decided he seemed like a nice guy and to give it a shot. Big mistake!

Over the phone we asked the price which he said was $50. When I asked if that was for both he said yes. I then reconfirmed ""two bikes"" to which his response was again ""yes"".

In the morning when he arrived he then told us $100 total. When I questioned him he insisted. We should have cancelled then but, due to his English not being perfect, I gave him the benefit of the doubt and assumed a misunderstanding. He was there ready with the bikes and the friend Anh he had bought along seemed so positive we agreed. I had noticed other tours for around $43 and thought $7 more would not be too steep. Besides we were packed and wanted to be on our way.

Whether we had therefore offended Mr Hoa I am unsure, but he said practically nothing for the rest of the trip. One word answers despite my best attempts to engage in conversation. This was supposed to be a tour and he promised us many sights. But pretty much just drove and stopped for us to occasionally take a photo. We did go to the elephant falls but that was pretty much it. Otherwise just a couple of short stops on the route with no information given. I will say his friend Anh was much more talkative and friendly and seemed a nice guy, but this was still no tour and Mr Hoa seemed to not hide his dislike for us (whatever reason it was).

When we arrived he then demanded $60 each. We asked why and he said $60 including lunch. Lunch was awful and by no means worth $10 in Vietnam. Just an excuse to try hike the price up. I ended up giving him about $55 after discussion (more than actual tours that seem to have great reviews) just to be rid of him.

So we learnt the hard way and yes, were taken in due to our own kindness. So this review is in the hope no others make the same mistake."
"This place is huge so get ready for a long walk. For much of it, it's a wall within a wall within a wall. There are explanations throughout via the signage which is helpful.

The whole thing was destroyed throughout the war but they are slowly restoring bit by bit. Those which are already restored is amazing and the other ruins are a reminder for what it was. Amazingly beautiful.

Another tip - if you go here first, you can buy a discount pass that can include other destinations. If you are already going to visit them, then it's worth looking. We didn't know until we arrived here which was our last stop so it was too late."
Really great to see! You can spend a whole day there. A very nice park and buildings. Guides available
"Many area are still in construction, while others were not reconstructed well, to colorfull or too new. The best conserved palace is camera prohibit as well.

I recommend that you should hire a tour guide understand what you see fully."
"From my repeated experience, Hue is the most friendly big city in Vietnam. Much better than Hoi An. Not that many people scream at you and bather you. Food is cheap ang great. Hue citadel is big and quite average. Full visit takes at least 2,5 hours. Nevertheless it has some really nice parts which really are worth the visit. Not many info in English so bring a Lonely planet guide or Vietnamese guide with you."
"It's undeniable that Hue Imperial Citadel is the most-visited place in Hue. Its peace and beauty and history show a lot about the changing period in political status. One more tip, if you are foreigners, you'd better visit with a local tourguide."
I think the Citadel is quite average. It has lots of grounds but nothing really spectacular. You enter at one end and walk through to the exit at the other end but there's nothing along the way that really makes you want to linger for a photo moment. Maybe it's because I went to all the tombs first before visiting the Citadel. A bit too much old buildings for the whole day.
"Went here towards the end of a day full of tombs. Enjoyable and it gives you a good insight into how life was. Lots of pictures and an interactive video.
Unfortunately most has been destroyed by US bombings.
Felt it was slightly overpriced at 150,000 dong. Not much directions and more information would have been helpful. Would recommend going with a tour guide to find out more."
"Excellent place to visit for the history of Hue and Vietnam, well worth it. Take time to wander around and also see the video showing the history."
"Very interesting place to visit & informative. Plenty to see and learn about the history of the dynasty. The buildings that have been restored are amazing. Good walk around the whole area, amazing how big the place was. Best thing to see in Hue."
The temples are in good condition and restoration is still in progress. The site is extensive and even though there are a large number of tourists it did not feel crowded. Opening times are 07:00 to 19:30. The tombs of the emperors are outside of the citadel and require an extra entrance ticket. Allow about a half day to thoroughly investigate the palaces and gardens. There are a couple of cafes inside the walls and public toilets are available on site.
"Must see if you are in town
This is a historical visit of importance
And details the kings of Vietnam"
"We had no idea this forbidden city existed in Vietnam, we toured the massive space in the morning its BIG! Very interesting look at how royalty lived back in the day. Must see while in Hue."
"Interesting and nicely maintained. Reminded me a bit of Imperial city in Beijing but smaller. More exhibits and photos. Can dress up as he king and queen, sounds hokey but was a laugh. Definately a must see in Hue."
"It is a must and really worth seeing. It takes approx half a day, but is also possible within two hours"
"The citadel is big and there are no clear directions. There are some exhibitions with information in english, it's a must visit but honestly kind of a let down. The buildings are poorly maintained and oftentimes just ruins. The most impressive thing about it was, like I said, the size of it."
"You will need a few hours to see this place. Read up about it beforehand and do it solo, no tours, so you can enjoy it at your pace, not someone else's. It is truly an amazing place and a great insight into the culture of the emperors and their mandarins. Pay a visit to the temple of the monk who self immolated himself in 1963 in protest against he government. His car is still there."
"Delightful outing to visit the ""forbidden city"" of Vietnam's last royal family, the Nguyens. Very pleasant to walk in the parklike grounds far from the hustle and bustle of the city (and no mopeds!)
The have just finished restoring the gorgeous library. A must for any visitor to Hue."
"We wandered around here for hours. We were astonished how beautiful the Imperial city is. Our guide told us a lot of very interesting stories about the Citadel and about the history of Vietnam. He also took us to some places of the Citadel which were out of the way so we were more or less the only tourists there. There is an interesting video of the citadel in the second building after the gate.
The drawback: we walked too long, too tired"
"The Citadel is a fascinating visit not only for the history but also the sheer size of the area. This is a bonus as you can wander around at your leisure and not feel overwhelmed by crowds, (you could spend half a day easily). There are little shops within the complex to buy gifts and refreshments."
"I would give this location at least 2 hours to explore. You'll want to get a guide book or something to help with explaining the significance of the structures, as there are few signs offering any detail about the palace or its usage and history."
"I enjoyed this tour, very information and lovely statues and structures for photography lovers, I had fun taking some shots of this Epic monumental site.
The history behind it all was also a very cool thing to learn."
The ancient citadel is beautiful. It's over a very large site and takes a few hours to tour around. It's in various states of repair from fully restored to war razed ruins. The restoration programme appears in full flow but I imagine it's decade from completion.
"Palaces are usually grand places where you stand in awe of the building, but not this one.

It is in poor condition and needs a makeover. Some are trying to get it renovated."
"Hue's must visit attraction, large spacious imperial grounds, so large that it feels like a private tour in spite of many visitors. No maps available at ticket office so better to take Lonely Planet or similar if not on a guided tour, no touts or hawkers inside the walls the day I went but a few strategically placed coffee shops with food, and excellent modern toilets dotted around ."
"My favorite Hue attraction - void of hagglers and tourist hords. Although many visitors, the area is so vast that the scatter around."
"I went to visit the Hue Imperial city. The entrance fee is 150,000 dong.

Find the ticket price abit pricey for the type of attraction it is.

The area is small and the palaces are poorly maintain."
"They haven't done much for tourist access - if you walk, you'll enter via the street as there is no sidewalk. Also it isn't clear that if you get a combo ticket, the other included sites are no where near the citadel. There is almost no mention of the Vietnam war, which is pretty common throughout Vietnam. But there is enough here to still make for an interesting visit"
"A visit to Vietnam should include Hue, the ancient Capitol. The jewel in the crown is the Citadel with its architecture and artifacts even if you're not a history buff you'll enjoy a visit here. Set aside some time to visit Thien Mu Pagoda and the Tombs of Tu Duc and Minh Mang and boat ride on the Perfume River as well. Arrange a guide to try and get some better understanding of the history."
We came here on a quiet slightly rainy afternoon. It was charming to stroll through the buildings. Many shrine rooms and elaborately decorated gates. It's a great spot for photos. You will enjoy it for its history and beautiful environment.
"The citadel is really wonderfull with wondeful pieces of art in wall paintings, roof decorations ... It is worth a visit but be aware in a sunny day it may be too much sun exposure and heat."
A must visit place at Hue although not as grand as the forbidden palace in Beijing it's still unique.
"This place is packed full of interesting facts about the old monarchs and how they ruled. The buildings and architecture is well worth the trip. We had our own tour guide but I would think you would struggle to do it on your own as the signs only give limited information and there is so much more to learn. Top tip, is to go at sunset to capture the best photographs"
One place to put on your things to do. A place they are trying slowly to restore with a lot of history
"If you like history, you must visit this. However, it isn't a spectacular place since it was ruined earlier and is now restored. Involves lots of walking to see the place. The best part was just clicking pictures here."
looks like the one in Beijing but here everything is not really ancient. all are rebuilt and fake. Not worth it.
"This place is stunning for photography and architecture. If you are in Hue, this is your main attraction! Do not miss it"
"If you've seen any of the other sights around Hué, skip this one, it's completely devoid of any sort of character."
"The first thing I need to say in this review is BEWARE of cyclo drivers. Our experience on the way to Citadel left a really bad taste. After we'd crossed the bridge we were harassed by two cyclo operators. They would not leave us alone, followed us, got in front of us, pure harassment. When they realised we couldn't be persuaded they very kindly insisted we change direction as the normal entrance was closed, they continued to follow and divert us. What they in fact did was send us on a journey that saw us walk the entire perimetre of the complex in searing heat. There is only one entrance and one exit. I've never been so duped or angry in all my travels as I was this day. It was just pure nasty. Take my advice and DO NOT deviate from you're planned route!
There are no brochures available at the site, so I would recommend doing some research before you go, the seeing is nothing without the history and understanding.
Whilst some restoration is underway, much of the Imperial City is in very poor repair and yet in the big scheme of things it is not that old.
Compared to the Hanoi Citadel, Hue's had a lot more to offer - bigger and much more complete. A must do when visiting Hue - in hindsight I would have used a guide, it is a huge site."
"What a gorgeous place to spend an afternoon in. The Imperial City (Forbidden Purple City) was full of ancient ruins, striking architecture, and national treasures that will keep you clicking your camera away.

It costs 150,000 Dong to enter. A bit costly, buy worth it. Especially knowing it's a UNESCO site."
Everyone who comes to Hue should visit the Citadel as it's a world class site with so much history. Allow a couple of hours at least as it's quite a large place.
"Better than a hike.
Many amazing places and details. Prefer a visit with a tourguide. Other ise you won't get the big picture. And it is big!! Love it!"
"There is a perception that this is an ancient site but only goes back to 18th century. For all the history of the emperor's and mandarins who stayed here, the buildings looked moss covered and broken down in many places. I am sure wars and lack of money has not helped but slowly they are restoring this valuable site. Give it a few years maybe?"
"Starting with seeing the movie that explains the history, walking through teh grounds and the different buildings, reading the notes in every place. We loved the place and it's very easy to walk alone with out a guide"
We came here after visiting two tombs and wish we would have had more time to really explore these large grounds.
"-A tiny bit overpriced: for the non tour guide it cost 150k per adult
-Site keeps getting renovated. My 1 year old lonely planet was very out of date.
-Beautiful sites. Many exhibitions (photos, imperial objects).
-Visited during the start of November. I personally recommend"
"This is by far the best thing we have seen in Vietnam. It's a massive compound and the buildings are old and very nice, there is pictures and lots of informative dotted around of how the place used to look and who used to live there! it's honestly worth the walk. I would highly recommend walking to the imperial city as it's nicer way to experience the place. Worth worth worth every single dong"
It is huge. Really gorgeous grounds and a wonderful night glimpse into Imperial Vietnam. Could have spent longer than the 3 hours we had there.
"The side is actually pretty big. And restoration is progressing rapidly. We were quite impressed' with the side, and spent almost two hours' walking around taking pics."
"Huge place with loads of history and intrigue. We went with our local guide Son from About Asia and learned so much about this extraordinary place and time. It was quite warm, so pace yourself, there is a lot to take in. The beautiful gold and red pillars and the French influence (and pillaging thereafter) retold by a local Hue resident whose family lived through the Vietcong horrors is both heartbreaking and breathtaking. Choose a guide wisely for the real story. Good way to spend 4 hours and feel like you learned something you couldn't be taught anywhere else."
Loved the Imperial ciry of Hue! Very Royal!! Most of the citadel part has been destroyed during the Ameriacan war. But definately one of the main attraction to visit when in Hue! It has been maintained very well and they are also condtructing and restoring some destroyed parts of the imperial city. It feels like you are transported to that era!! Very historic. Had a wonderful visit. :)
"If you visit Hue this is one of the highlight, much of the Citadel was destroyed during the war though what remained still tells you a rich history of what was once stood there"
The Citadel is a must. The architecture and ornate decorations are beautiful. Walking the grounds is also a treat. If you go with a guide know your history as ours was factually incorrect particularly on post WWII to the Vietnam War.
"I have been here few times and honestly it never let me down. I love to see all of the old style of structure which includes all Royal Vietnamese symbol: dragon, Phoenix, number nine.
I'm so impressed by this 30-year-build Citadel. The first round outside is a little bit crowded with all house and the traffic of the grandchildren of the old Mandarin Advisors.
The sencond round of the place is begin with the most beautiful gate I've seen- the Ngo Mon Gate with the Five Phoenix tower and the beautiful and graceful tiled roof. Then inside is the place filled with tree and lake which is full of fish and lotus so the place is greenand cool all the whole year.
I really like the back of the Forbidden city, where it has a big flower garden and big tree and the lovely-smell white flowers that some people use for making tea; or sometime you can watch those people practicing for show or things like that when they all dress up and the whole crew acts like the King mistress and eunuch and the band playing Royal court music. It is really interesting to watch and to understand more about the life of people who serving the King.
The path that we walk under those big tree around the city is cover with a old but good quality read bricks. That's one of typical type of Vietnamese bricks.
This is a must when you visit Hue. It take more than 3 hours of walking to finish the whole place. But you won't feel tired at all with all of the beautiful scenery of the place."
"There are many interesting buildings, including thrown room and a small theatre in the imperial city, which also has the ubiquitous temples. Fascinating history, worth a visit."
"Wow great place to see, very big palace etc. Undergoing restoration. Make sure you checkout the entrance as it's on the riverside otherwise you will have to walk half way round the wall surrounding it. Enjoy. Good coffee shop ""the one coffee and bakery"""
"Although most of the structure of this city was destroyed during the Vietnam war, but you still can see lot of culture in here.. the golden throne was used from the first and last king of Vietnam. Great architecture works.."
"Before we reached the ticketing booth, we were approached by several rickshaw drivers, telling us that the Citadel is too vast to walk, and suggested that we hired the rickshaw to cut down on walking time, etc. We were initially quoted 500,000 vnd for the ride, and when we declined, the price went down to 100,000 vnd instantly. We did not take up their offers as the rickshaws are not allowed to enter the Citadel. Moreover, they were not honest to start off.
Arm yourself with a good pair of walking shoes and umbrella/hat as it can get quite hot. The garden is vast and if you enjoy history and looking at old palaces/architecture, gardens, you will probably need to allocate half a day here. Entrance ticket is 150,000 vnd.
There are electric cars for hire inside the compound. The weather got too hot and we decided to hop on the car after walking around for an hour. The driver cum guide was quite informative. We took the 45 mins tour trip, which cost 240,000 vnd for one car with 7 seating capacity.
This place is definitely worth a visit."
If you are in Hue then this is definitely one of the highlights and it's getting better every year with the ongoing restorations. Highly recommended.
"We went here with maybe a bit too high expectations. The ticketcounter is staffed by unmotivated and quite rude people. You don't get a map, you don't get any explanation or recommendation about what to do once inside.
When you get inside it is BIG. A map would certainly be a welcome tool here. We used Google Maps to navigate around. The buildings, or at least many of them, have lost their original glory. When we were there a few buildings were being renovated so maybe in a few months time the whole place will have a bit more appeal.

Last but not least a quite annoying detail: you can not exit where you entered. When you try to do so an angry employee will point you to the exit point, 30 meters away he says. This is an outright lie. The exit is actually about 1 kilometer further and they don't have signs to direct you. The rude and angry reaction from the staff when trying to exit at the entrance point is just completely wrong and made sure I left pissed off.

However, if you are in Hue anyway and want to see some of the rich history in the city I'd say do go there, but manage your expectations.

Ps. If you go with good weather bring water! It's quite a long walk and not every where you get to walk in the shade."
"There is a lot to see in the Imperial City, we walked the grounds for nearly 2 hours. It helps if you do a bit of research before you arrive so you know what you're looking at. There is a small restaurant in the far back right corner with a very nice man that served us (best fried rice we've had in Vietnam and amazing spring rolls)."
"Spent a few hours here, some great architecture and steeped in history. Many parts have been restored over the years and some are gone forever"
"Walk we did very picturesque. Amazing views and great visuals from the time we entered up until and including leaving. Incredibly calming. there were options of quided tours, but we used the good old standby Eyewitness tour guides."
Great place but if you don't have a guide to explain what you're looking at you're seriously missing out.
I suppose i have become sinical to all these great monolithes to establish thier rulers imortality at huge expense to the local populous...Another monster construction completed severalm years after the old..actualy not so oldbastard died. ..take a look at me..wasnt i just great. Even got a passage made socan get ba k from the afterlife.. What arrogence..anyway hes dead and the locals think its ok...his son died in paris...good move.
"Visited this with a tour guide and it was pretty interesting, the place and area surrounding it was bigger than I thought. I enjoyed the photos and descriptions hanging on the walls. Outside there is alot of people trying to sell you stuff and tons of those men with their pedal bikes wanting to take you back to your hotel afterwards. I enjoyed this visit."
Well worth visiting- again it's likely to be better with time as more & more is restored. Worth using a guide or a very good book!
"Excellant historical gem, well worth a visit with lots to see and do..... Only thing is could do with more signage to let you know where things are etc"
"This building has a lot of history, both ancient and modern. It is the main attraction, I would think, in Hue. The buses have to park outside the gates and you must walk in. A guide is necessary to explain the history. Tours all seem to only want to talk about the ancient history and not stories from Vietnam war. Of course 3/4ths of Vietnam population was born after 1975. The walking is not uphill or hard, just a fair distance. Also it was very hot and humid the day we went."
"Very nice to see and learnsome real history of the last Emporer of Vietnam. We advice you to book the day tour, but do it in 2 days. So start you tour and take the citadel in the afternoon and take the next morning the other half of the tour to the pagode. This as to take this tour in one day is quite a lot te absorb in one day. You do not pay extra for this since they have these tours everyday.
Hue is great for a history tour. If you plan to go south after hue take the train to Danang / Hoi An (3,5 hr) for great mountain views and coastal views. Ho An should not be missed on your trip."
"Right in the centre of town, this impressive area is a must see
150k vnd entry but well worth the money
Was beginning to doubt whether vietnam had anything to compare with Thailands temples......it has !!"
"The Imperial City is a walled fortress and palace in the city of Huế, the former imperial capital of Vietnam. The grounds of the Imperial City are protected by fortified ramparts 2 kilometers by 2 kilometers, and ringed by a moat.
The Citadel was the centre of a fierce battle lasting some weeks during the Tet offensive in 1968 and much damage was done, however is progressively being restored"
"We went armed with our Lonely Planet as guide, and walked anti clockwise around the grounds exploring every dilapidated building or staircase we could. It was the most colourful and genuinely interesting monument we'd visited on our trip (to this point) so spent a good 2.5-3 hours exploring. The LP book (2016 version) was an adequate guide although renovations had already progressed at an astounding rate pushing the book out of date. Very pleasing to see the amount of investment in such an important historic monument. Plenty of spaces/rooms with fans or air con too to revive in the heat! A couple of cafes and a small restaurant on site too."
An eye opener to me. It was very humid when I was there so did not spend as much time as I would have like. It has got so much history to absorb. Must visit
Very impressive past residence of Vietnamese emperor. Although much of the complex was destroyed in Vietnamese War what remains is very impressive and worth visiting. World heritage site which is being progressively restored
When we toured the Citadel it was in the middle of a major rainstorm and it was not the most pleasant experience. The history of this site was amazing. It was where past Emperors of Vietnam had ruled from and we were able to see many of the buildings with wonderful art work and hear of the past of the rulers. The buildings still need some work but the art work and historical objects more than make up for it. It would have been nice to walk through the buildings without all the rain to mar the tour.
Perhaps we needed a guide to bring the citadel alive for us because we did not feel it was worth the money just walking around on our own.
"This is the citadel of Nguyen dynasty. Although it was damaged by the wars, it's still beautiful. You should come here to hear about some interesting stories"
"This place is an ancient city thousands of year prior and historical monuments . Spread in perhaps a km square or more , you can see traditional art and the things of that period in pagodas as well as museums. A vibrant local market too bustles with frenetic activity . Lots of eating spaces too . Sunset by the lake with floating boats is mesmerizing"
"I paid for a tour guide which meant that it was 300000 dong to enter. My tour guide then constantly hinted at a tip which ruined the experience for me, as I felt I had already paid too much. She was knowledge though and having someone explain the history to me made it worthwhile... catch 22."
"So much history.
Such a magnificent building, restoration work being done. Still along way to go. The video shown gave a good insight into life here in the Citadel"
Very interesting place ... worth to see if you visit Hue City ...a lot to see ..access to city centre
"Pretty much the only thing to do in Hue, paid 150.000 to get in which is a bit pricey for essentially some ruins. Chinese style architecture was lovely though and different from what we had seen so far. We also fed the giant koi carp which was fun."
I was impressed at the size and scope of this city. It's well worth checking out to walk around all the buildings and marvel at the structure of this place.
Absolutely loved the citadel. We had a private tour which I think is the best thing to do. We learned so much interesting information about vietnams history and it was great seeing some restored and some original areas within. Well worth the trip even though it was pouring with rain.
"The citadel is something to go see, while in Hue. It is huge and very much to see and take pictures of. Would really go there, while in Hue, although if you've been in other places like this, you kind of have seen it already. Visited off season, so not many tourists either."
"Fortress include Imperial City and the Forbidden City, which resembles the Forbidden City in Beijing. On the tour of whole complex we are needed 2-3 hours, but warto.Wiele building is restored perfectly, showing the art of the ancient builders."
"This place is awe inspiring. Yes much but of it now lies in ruins but it just highlights the great sadness of wars that have impacted such historical grandeur, which in itself is an important part of history. Our 4 year old loved feeding the fish too. Well worth a visit!"
Take a half day off and visit this impressive palace of emperors. It will take hours to walk it through and read all the info about it but its worth it
don't forget to constantly rehydrate (bottles water is readily available but pricey inside) and have sunscreen on you; it's easier to know where you're going if you've got a map on you (we had our trusty lonely planet guide book!)
The history of the imperial city is very interesting however the sights aren't. We got sucked in by a cyclo rider who charged us around $12 to take us around the out skirts which isn't necessary. Then another $18 (for two people) to get into the citadel... It's hard to describe inside as it has the potential to be super beautiful like places in Kyoto which is what they are aiming for but at the moment the grass is over grown and it needs some TLC.
"I went by myself without a guide and found that a lot of the exhibits were less interesting for me because I didn't know what I was looking at. The whole place is huge and there's not a ton of signage - I even got lost. It is pretty cool, but this might be one of those activities where going with a guide might be better since they can give context to the things that you are seeing. If you like history, you'll love it. Still pretty cool either way!"
A very good tour.Not one for people who are not fond of walking.Quite a few things to see.A large part of Vietnamese history
"Visited this place in the afternoon, the weather was hot but there were several shady areas/corners. It was definitely worth visiting to find out about the emperors and their way of life. Only manage to cover about a quarter of the palace as i came with a guide, would love to explore more in future."
Quite area with some nice palace. good locaton to see sunset. spending over 2 hours to discover every coner is worthy. A must see in Hue
"Bigger than first expected and so much to see inside, spending a few hours walking around here was great as the grounds are fantastic with many different buildings to see. Lots of information about the history of the Imperial City too"
"If you visit Hue, you can't miss to visit Imperial City in Hue, it was more impressive than I thought.
I highly recommend this place to every visitor."
"Very interesting place. Reach palace, a lot of historical things. You can move 200 and more years before."
"Great place, under restoration. Enough to see though, and very beautiful. I think in 5-6 years time when a whole lot more restoration has been done it will be up there with the best heritage places in the world."
"It's vaguely interesting to walk round but it's crazy expensive, you are better off just going round the outskirts for free, there is simply not much to see, typically Vietnamese museums or historical sites are woefully short of relevant or interesting information."
The Citadel is at the heart of Hue and is a must visit place. It is here you should purchase your 4 site tickets so that you can gain entrance later to the 3 most important tombs at a much cheaper rate. Give yourself at least 2 hours in the Citadel - it is much bigger than you think - do delve into every corner to witness restoration work currently happening!
Huge and imposing space. Make sure you allow plenty of time because it's big!!! If it's hot. Take a hat!
"This citadel has been much reviewed and it fully justifies being included in UNESCO list of common heritage of mankind. Just want to add a word about the splendidly renovated Imperial Theatre which offers afternoon performances of classical Vietnamese music, dance and song. The performances done spectacular costumes and live musicians, dancers are all excellent."
"For a history buff this was great. We got the tour guide (150,000 dong) and it was worth it to get the extra history behind the buildings. The buildings themselves are also impressive.

It's very hot walking around though. Take some water!"
"So nice to see. The complex is very large so spent 4 hrs there. A couple of must see things are the 9 cannons which is located just out of the large flag on both sides of the entry. Then the 9 urns at Mien temple. The emperor main room was impressive but cannot take photos inside. There is other impressive temples to see. Make sure you print a map of the place. There is some on site maps but not that detailed. Cost is $150,000 d for entry."
"We just chose to cycle around. We did not choose to go in.
Looked like it wasnt well maintained.
Paintwork, bricks, etc not solid."
"The ticket is a bit expensive (150'000Dong) but this is a must see UNESCO site, a couple of hours walking in the history of the country."
Its a shame it has not been better maintained over the years. It is incredible to imagine the role the complex has played through history
"To students of history, the Citadel is a trove of information on Imperial Vietnam. The exhibits are annotated in Vietnamese, English and French, so it's possible to understand them without a guide. That said, hiring a guide adds greatly to the knowledge you can gain from a visit to the Citadel - I'd certainly hire one if I visited the site again.. There is so much on display that a guide would be able to distill and build an historical framework for.

We allowed 3 hours for our visit. That was not enough time to see everything, but it did allow us to go beyond the main exhibits. There are several places where you are required to remove your shoes before entering, so you could reduce the time you spend by not entering them. In many cases, I noted that photography is not permitted in buildings where footwear needs to be removed, so your best bet is to photograph through the open windows and doors.

The period of French colonialism in Vietnam is thoughtfully portrayed in the Citadel. The choices presented to the Kings by the French were not attractive, but they had to be made.

I have visited quite a few UNESCO World Heritage sites and this one, like the others, does not disappoint."
You need to be happy to walk/wander for a couple of hours to take in all the intricate architecture and history of this Imperial Citadel. Well worth a visit.
"Quite expensive for the ticket 360,000 vnd but worth it for all 4 sites, beautiful grounds well worth checking out. All possible in 1 day"
"You can see it is a historical place and people are actually working on it but it feels like there is way more that needs to be done.
Misses the glory of such a cultural place"
"Lots of story's from the guide regarding the history kings etcetera but also historical, Nice big site.
I expect that this Will be the main historical thing from our 3 weeks visit in Vietnam"
"Yes okay so the entrance fee was a bit more than what we wanted to pay for our travelling budget..
But it was a very interesting, great place to take photos and the place is massive!! Much bigger than it looks from the outside.. highlight of Hue :-)"
"The Citadel was interesting and glad we went. There is reconstruction taking place at the moment, which detracts from the character of the place. I recommend reading a little bit about the history of the place beforehand, as the information on signs etc. is lacking."
"I always wanted to see the Imperial City, and glad we did. We had a guide. A decent amount of walking."
Although i would leave it a couple of years before I would go back as there are extensive renovations going on it was well worth seeing the beautiful buildings and reading about the history of the country
My husband and I spent 2.5 lovely hours wondering around the compound. Lots to see and a nice way to spend an afternoon or morning.
Our family visited the imperial city as part of a guided tour around the area. My husband in particular really enjoyed it as he loves history and war related stuff. The buildings are old and while we were there we watched some Vietnamese people working on restoring one of the buildings. We spent a couple of hours there but I'd say you could see everything you need in less time.
Must see for historical insight to Vietnam's past. We had a guide to help explain the site but you could navigate on your own
"It gives you a great impression of how the people lived in anciet days in vietnam, very impressive. It is as if you are walking around in one of these kunfu movies."
"This a most interesting place to visit .It covers quite a large area and there a many buildings and areas to view. There has been a large amount of restoration work done to get things looking like they once were, majestic. Sorry no photos had a faulty memory card."
"Get a good guide who explains the place, made it all the more interesting. Loved the different areas and rooms within the Citadel."
"This is the main tourist attraction in Hue and is well worth a visit. Entry to the Imperial enclosure is through a large gate, the Ngo Mon gateway. Be sure to watch the audiovisual presentation in the Thai Hoa Palace, the large building directly in front of the entrance, to get an overview of the complex. A lot of ruins remain, but many buildings are being restored. Take the time to wander the Co Ha Gardens with lakes, pavilions and innumerable bonsai - serene and relaxing."
"Lovely place, will visit again for sure. I have visited it twice now. Once with a guide once without.
I would recommend going with a guide so you get all the interesting little stories.
I can recommend Stop and Go Tours in Hue they were fantastic and organised a very knowledgeable guide and driver with door to door hotel pick-up and drop off."
buildings and flowers great for photo taking . Suggest good walking shoes .Area of importance Walls !
"very informative ... history of the rulers of vietnam, their kings, ministers advisors. huge place ... takes around minimum 2 hours of sight seeing."
"If in Hue, the Citadel is a must if for no other reason than its topographical dominance. That said, whilst impressive in scale, its has been badly knocked about by time, as well as, no doubt, the exigencies of war. Although the Vietnamese and Chinese have been intermittently at war for 1500 years what is conspicuous is the all pervasive Chinese cultural influence. Albeit that Vietnam has long since adopted the Roman alphabet, it is Chinese calligraphy which adorns old buildings and monuments and Chinese architectural models which marks them.

Worth a visit but be prepared to be a little underwhelmed."
"This place is really old, and it shows it's real charm. The place is a nice place to have a walk around while enjoying the gardens. The history is really interesting as well.."
"If you are in the neighbourhood it is worth a visit, but I wouldn't travel specially to Hue for the Citadel. The ancient buildings are mostly well kept, but unfortanately there is a lot of damage because of the war. The gardens were in need of some attention."
"We spent just over an hour walking through the Citadel and found that was plenty. Although it was very interesting to see, it wasn't anything spectacular. Sad that most of it was destroyed.. Felt like an abandoned town while we were there but you can see workers restoring buildings. Would probably recommend a guide for those wanting more information as there aren't many signs or explanations inside. 150000d felt pricy just for an entrance fee.
Overall it was interesting to see and a good way to spend a couple hours!"
"I am really impressed with the architecture and the general structure of the citadel which was home to Nguyen Kings and the Royal family. The Noon Gate is a beautiful construction containing the poetic features and it looks so charming yet magnificent and solemn. Enter the citadel, I stepped into another world where represents the life of the last dynasty in the past. So impressive!"
We visited the Imperial Citadel in the afternoon on a week day. Paid about 120 000 each for access. It was quiet and the light was great for photos. The restoration of the ancient buildings is impressive. Great way to spend a few hours in the afternoon as there is a lot of shade in which to escape the heat. Go hug a topiary turtle.
"Great History and takes a whole afternoon, but worth it if you are interested in the Vnese kings of the past.. UNESCO cutural site."
"Huge attraction with lots to see, plan to spend a few hours here wandering around the old city and exploring the grounds."
A place that is being restored slowly building by building. What is available is very interesting and well worth a visit. Maybe not must see.
"I was excited to visit the citadel, but got really disappointed. The entrance looks somewhat nice, but that was actuallyml more or less the nicest of everything. Outside at the ticketshop I asked for a map, because it is kind of big and it would be helpful to know where to go and know what it is you are looking ay: they told me I couls get it inside. Asked it at the ticket control: no English, but he pointed to a big emperor house. Also there no maps, but the possibility to buy a few books..
I walked around for like 3 hours, keep hoping for beautifully buildings / temples or interesting stories, but after 3 hours I was completely tired, sweaty and very disappointed. Besides the entrance my highlight was a short video (made by Korea as a gift), which gave some information about the history and use of the citadel."
"We visited the Citadel as it was listed in our guide book. There is a lot to see here, the Citadel is an impressive site over a large area. There is a vast refurbishment project underway, however the site displays the history of the Royal Palace overtime. When visiting the museums in and around the Citadel we would advise that the exhibits are taken in context. The volatility of the Vietnamese History leads to what seems to be a one sided argument - which is understandable but can be a little taxing!!!"
"It is true, as some reviewers have mentioned, that the majority of the grounds are in very bad ruins. Though they are slowly restoring the buildings. What has been restored has been done with exceptional detail & care.
We were very impressed with the historical significance & the understanding of the culture that the Citadel shared with us."
"When you arrive I would strongly advise to get a tour guide. They are 150 000 vnd, no matter what the group size, but make they trip so much better. There is limited information if you go in without a guide but you get much more with it. The entrance fee is 150 000 vnd per person.

The Citadel is very historical and it is a shame that so much has been destroyed over the years but what they have restored is stunning and a must see in Hue."
"Only a sliver of what it was ... Such a pity. Sprawling grounds and good to just wonder around and imagine what it once was.

What surprised us was that Hue was so influenced by the Chinese. Felt like we were in China ..."
A very nice experience from which a lot can be learned about vietnam prewar history. Also the monuments are truthly impressive.
During our tour of Vietnam we went to see many Citadels but this was a very memorable Imperial City. I recommend spending a couple of hours and seeing the beautiful Imperial city Citadel
"A must see. Tastefully renovated. Can learn a lot even without a guide. Nice gardens. Souvenir shops with nice staff. Perhaps a little over priced, but admission to the antiquities museum is included."
"Plan your route to the palace because you can only enter at the front which faces the river. We walked for over an hour in the baking heat before we got to the entrance.

It's well worth a visit but please ensure you come with water because it involves lots of open air walking, also eat prior to arriving as you are extremely limited for food options inside the walls."
"Be prepared for a lot of walking but it is well worth the 150,000 dong to enter this site.
A lot of the buildings have been destroyed through wars and either rebuilt or are being rebuilt but don't let this deter you. The site is full of history from the last couple of hundred years"
"Hard to rate - giving Beijing Forbidden City top 5 stars means I cannot give this the same as it is by no means that good, but it is still very nice to see and certainly not something to miss if you are in Hue. Lots of renovation being done very carefully but much still to do."
Very Interesting - a must visit - this place is huge and on a hot day it is really exhausting. Allow plenty of time to make the most of this trip - I would recommend half a day to have a good look around
"We enquired about the tour operators on sunday morning from Hong Kong and got a response within 5 minutes.
Our driver (Mr Hui) and guide (Mr Thuan) reached our hotel to pick us up before time and waited extra time without any remorse as we were late.
During our trip, the guide told us not only about the destination, but also about life n general in Vietnam.
He gave an extensive insight about the daily life of an average Vietnamese person.
Thoroughly enjoyed our trip and highly recommend this tour operator."
It is enormously built and it takes you right to Hollywood. You would feel like you are watching one of those period action films.
It has been nice to visit the old imperial city. But it's kind of the same. You can get bored after a while.
"We all know it is not fun to walk an entire city when it's pouring heavily. Due to our trip was short and we had lots of plans to do lots of things in 3 different states, we have to suck it up and walk in the rain.

The city is huge. If you want to walk the entire city, it may take up to 4 hours to admire all the works that has been done to such a beautiful place. If you do enjoy exploring how palaces looks like back in the day, spending some time walking in Hue Imperial City is ideal.

It's best to enjoy the walk on a sunny day as there are a lot of shades. I saw tram rides being available as well. You probably have to pay a little more. Otherwise, walking in rain can be quite fun if you're not with senior citizens. My mum and aunt at 55-60yrs old) enjoyed the walking though and the rain didn't stop them.

Ticket cost at VND150,000 per person."
"Definitely one of my most favorite places in Vietnam to visit. My friend and I had only planned 2 hours to visit the citadel, which was obviously not enough. When I go back in the future, I will plan at least one whole day here and make sure to bring with me a good DSLR camera because this is a magnificent place to take photos.
Love everything about it, can't really remember the ticket price anymore but however much it was, it was really worth it.
Inside the citadel, there is a theater and they have scheduled royal music performance which we missed because we had not known about this. Do plan ahead and check out the time if you want to catch the show inside the citadel, which is of course highly recommended!"
The complex is massive and feels so. From the outside it looks very old. But they some new things in side like a tennis court put in by the last ruler
old citadel and good view so much.you can walk around there for 2 hour and take picture with King chair
"We could easily understand about the last dynasty of Vietnam before being the colony of French.
Memomentori"
"A real oasis inside the city. If you buy the combined tickets for Citadel and tombs you make the tour really cost effective.
Really worth a visit."
"Worth visiting! Some repairs have recently done. Giving a good impression of Imperial Vietnam. I loved the ""library"" and the main palace."
"We started our day at the complex of Minh Mang , then went to that of Khai Dinh and after that it all went a bit downhill.
The nearby pagoda was so-so and by the time we got to the citadel, we were prepared, we thought, for disappointment. No, it was still disappointing - vast swathes of nothing interspersed with the occasional building and a lot of reconstructed ones.
Don't get me wrong, it's still worth a visit and is still interesting, it's just hugely disappointing. It's also one of those places, like the Hanoi Prison, that you have to see if only to say you've been there. A quick drive through the town around the city is every bit as interesting.
Tourists are as usual assailed on all sides by hawkers, bicycle rickshaw drivers etc, but by now that should come as no surprise.
Look out for the occasional bullet-scarred wall and wonder what it must have been like 50 years ago.."
"It is disappointing to see that such a beautiful and special place has been allowed to fall into a state of disrepair, such that they barely mow the grass. Walkways are falling apart, gardens are overgrown and full of weeds, and yet they are re-building a main structure. Seems as though there is no budget for maintenance. Save your money and take pictures and view from the outside, for it isn't worth the price of admission to see from the inside."
"Must see for Hue, the site is massive and there's lots to see. Most of the signs have english translations and there's a lot of history. Not much is mentioned about the Tet offensive but its worth visiting such an important site for the battle of Hue"
Visited the Citadel on a tour organised through the Google Hostel - very interesting and good to see the history
Beautiful place.Not that much information so maybe consider a tour although we were happy without just wondering around. The cafe in the garden area has lovely views but very limited choice
"There are many small pools, bridges, and little tree around the Citydal. If you love architects, history of Trieu Nguyen...you should come here"
Great history attached to it although quite a lot of damage in places. Some buildings being restored. Worth a visit.
"The Citadel is a revered place in Hue. Hue was the imperial capitol of Vietnam for a very long time. In 1804, construction of the citadel was begun for the new emperor. There are many beautiful buildings and it is a place of serenity."
"Hue imperial citadel and forbidden purple city are fascinating and full of history.

To get the most out of it use a local guide that knows the history of the area to help make the most of it we used Hue private excursions for a guide and found them ti be excellent.

Do spend at least s few hours on it as it is spread over a large area. Some of it is in disrepair ir being repaired after successive wars but this just adds to the atmosphere of the place. The imperial citadel is not able to be entered between 12am and 1:30pm daily so plan your tour around this.

The inperial citadel was the highlight of our trip to Hue."
We arranged a tour with Peter Thuan Pham and this was one of the 1st stops. The whole place is amazing but would not have been nearly as enjoyable without a guide. I would highly recommend going around with someone who can give some background and history.
A must when visiting hue. Not as huge as the forbidden city of china but the government is slowly restoring it. Will visit again when I am next in Hue
Interesting to look at but I would recommend a guide. We learnt so much from ours that we could not possibly have picked up by ourselves
"Beautiful and impressive group of ancient buildings. All well preserved with some undergoing restauration.
Well worth a couple of hours visit."
"It is a huge complex. With oodles of history. I enjoyed the documents they had displayed woth some information regarding c9ntent. I went with a guided tour which was not so goid. Fortunately,there were other tours happening, so i was able to discreetly tag slong to learn more and different information. I can see why this place has mixed reviews, but, i still liked it."
"Make sure you give yourself 3-4 hours to tour this place, it is sooo interesting. It is unimaginable that years ago they had the knowledge to build these buildings they are magnificent."
You can't go to Hue and not visit the imperial city. My only advice is to note that the imperial city cannot be entered by cyclo and cyclo tours will only circumnavigate the outer walls of the citadel.
So interesting! A huge 36 hectares of Emperors history. Unfortunately 80% was destroyed in the wars but so much has been re-built.
"Huge ancient palace, sadly destroyed by the US army but now being slowly and carefully rebuilt.

Worth a visit."
"If you like architecture and history, and you happen to do a tour in Hue, this will be in it.
To bad so many of the buildings are damaged. But everything is being done to restore as much as possible.

Absolutely must see!!!"
"We had a slow stroll around the citadel was interesting, some of the buildings were restored beatifully, well worth the visit."
"I really enjoying walking around the imperial palace and the citadel. Was just very annoyed with the bike tour people telling us we couldn't walk in and ""had"" to take their bike tour in there! Lies. We told them all to go away and had a beautiful walk into and around. Don't fall for the scams and enjoy this beautiful piece of history."
"A pleasant experience walking around the citadel. Hired bikes from hotel and cycled to entrance. Had to park bikes outside, just inside the main wall, cost 10,000 VND. Entered via South end and spent one and half hrs roaming around at our leisure. Entrance fee 150000 VND. NO hassle from touts inside, but a few usual touts around when leaving to get bikes."
"If you go to only one place in Hue this should be it. It encapsulates all that makes Hue so important to Vietnamese people: the history, the culture. It's good to have a guide because there is not a lot of explanation. The complex is always under repair in some part, which is good as it means that the authorities consider it important to preserve it. Take plenty of water, and wear comfortable shoes as there is a reasonable amount of walking to see everything. There are small buses that can take you around."
"The imperial city of Hue is like a mini Forbidden city in Beijing. The good part is that it is not crowded (in fact there were almost no visitors inside which was really different than in China).
It is not well maintained (the grass is high, rubbish all around), but what I really disliked was the staff. They were unfriendly and rude and for 150.000 dong entry fee they really could behave a little better.
The price of water at some vendors is like everything in Vietnam - no price stated, the ""hey, let's overcharge the foreigners"" style. So, if you really have to go there, bring your own water as it is really hot and try to avoid the staff.
Didn't enjoy it and will not return."
"A lot of work is being done here to restore the tomb, not all of it good (not in keeping with the methods of the period). It is an interesting site though. Bring plenty of water!"
"You wouldn't go to Hue without checking this place out, it's a major attraction.
It's nice and had a lot of culture and history there.
You will need a tour guide or you won't have any idea what anything is.
It's huge though! We went in a scorching hot day and there is limited shade, fans or aircon"
Absolutely wonderful experience. We arranged a trip with a Mai Ling taxi from Hoi An to Hue then after visiting Hue the taxi took us to our next destination Danang. Imperial city was one of our visits in Hue and it is an amazing structure and how great they were in that time. You really have to visit this place to understand the magnificence of it.
You could probably spend half a day here. There are a lot of renovations going on at the moment and the site isn't quite as charming as other imperial cities but it's still worth a look. Don't go to the museum first as it will be included in your entry ticket at the main entrance to the city.
"A UNESCO site that is worth visiting. Although many parts are damaged, there is still quite a lot to see. The theatre is amazing and there is a lot of historic information that is available. We hired a private guide through Hue Private Cars which also provided the transport to take us there. The museum is also worth visiting."
First thing you see is a huge wall around it. Kind of reminds me of the Forbidden City in China. It's an old but beautiful place to visit.
Visited early in the morning to beat the heat. Still very hot and humidity just unbelievable. But a great time to visit before too many others arrived. The Citadel is a truly amazing place. So sad that it was damaged during the war. We didn't take a guided tour as we wanted to take our time wandering around. There is a lot of historic information translated into English so you can read and gain an understanding of the emperors since early 1800s and how they lost power as the French took control. The architecture and gardens are stunning. Took lots of great photos. If you visit Hue (which is a fabulous city) you must visit The Citadel. We left via a different gate to the one we came in. Which was fine because we got to see a bit of another part of the city - one which seemed to be more for locals than tourists. After walking around for a while we hailed a taxi to take us to the Minh Mang Tomb. The taxi driver said he'd wait for us (no charge) and then take us back to our hotel. So a really lovely half day visiting some special sites in Hue. Needed a break in our hotel to recover from the humidity before venturing out for an early dinner.
"Wow, this is an interesting place in Hue city. I love the sightseeing of this place and its history. I recommend Hue Imperial City for sure!"
"Reminds me of Beijing Forbidden City. So many courtyards, other smaller buildings left n right of main buildings."
"Must visit place in Hue, the architecture inside is simply breathtaking, combibe this with the tomb of the 13th and the 2nd king of Vietnam"
"This was a very cool and interesting place, but it is HUGE! So bank on spending a good chunk of time. Must see!"
Again worth the visit sad to see so much destroyed yet some beautiful buildings survived . Don't need guide if you don't want to much details some signs in English . The museum was beautiful with French vases !!!
"A good experience to see and read on history. Possibly not for everyone, but it there is so much history to be found around Hue."
"I'm not really sure how you rate an attraction like this, but it's well worth a bike through to check it out.

Just another neat part of an amazing city, and a good touchstone if you're lost!"
"This is a must see, and easily walkable from most hotels in Hue downtown. Unfortunately raining heavy when I went, so we took a bike cab. Be careful with these, since they can surprise you with additional charges. Don't miss seeing the gates and the museum here. Also interesting sites on the outside of the main fortress. Easy to spend a day here."
"Stunning buildings, amazing ancient and recent history. Best historical/cultural visit in Vietnam. Two or three hours is not quite enough time, but enough for an overview."
"Worth taking at least half a day to visit. Great architecture, beautiful setting, the courtyards and gardens are great to stroll trough, the temples and other buildings full of interesting angles. Not much (worth stopping at) food or drink as would be expected, plan ahead and enjoy your visit."
"The architecture is really cool and great for photos. The history is quite amazing, though you'll be terribly bored if you try to read every single bit of information. I highly recommend wandering to the outer corners. We went on a very rainy day which was a blessing in disguise - it wasn't hot, there were no mosquitos, and there were far fewer tourists than usual. There are plenty of places to duck out of the rain so don't let it scare you off!
I think that if you go on a sunny day, be sure you've got plenty of water and mosquito spray!"
A really impressive place where you can see the Nguyen dynasty buildings that were influenced by the Chinese architecture but by the French (Vauban style) as well
"It was raining a part of our visit in the citadel and yet it was really charming. The place is quite big so you should allow yourself about 3 hours.
Some building need a lot of restauration..."
"We walked from our hotel to the Citadel and consequently we were pretty hot and ""bothered"" by the time we walked through the gate. We were immediately approached by one of many cyclo tour guides who implored us to use his services. There was much discussion about the size of the site, how hot it was and several other factors designed to encourage us to use the cyclo. In the end we relented and we are so glad we did!! The Citadel is massive (over 500 acres) and unless you have a very detailed map you would not have a clue where any of the interesting sites are. Our drivers were interesting and listened to us when we said we weren't interested in certain sites. All in all the hour and a half was very interesting and we most certainly would not have seen anywhere near as much if we had tried walking around (in fact I think we would have given up and returned to our hotel) so do yourself a favour and negotiate a good price and enjoy the ride and this most fascinating historical and cultural site"
"We did a full day tour of Hue. It was a hot day, the tour guide was Ms Ho. Ms Ho was full of knowledge about her beautiful Country. It was a delight to learn about the royal dynasty. If you have time, it's worth every cent."
It is a huge monument with lots of things to see. The entrance fee is a bit high but acceptable if you buy a pack of entrances. Some parts are in need of restoration. It is a shame a lot was destroyed during Vietnam war...
"full of history and great architecture, but when i visited there were many buildings being refurbished. i guess it will be great when all finished. i have only a few hours to browse, but ideally you will need at least a day to leisurely walk through."
The citadel was the major drawcard behind my visit to Hue. What I really appreciated about the complex was that it could be explored and photographed in relative peace. There were no crowds or hawkers and it was easy to lose yourself in the scale of the place. A diverse mix of original & restored buildings as well as sites destroyed during war time. The Citadel provides an interesting insight into Imperial Vietnamese life.
"After a long walk I discovered the
Cafe restaurant THE GARDEN RIVER. Over looking the river ,the dragon boats and the Vietnamese way of life.
Peaceful place to relax in town! Preserved from the hard noise of the town. So great sometime.
Take it easy for a hour or two. The place is relaxing and u will meet the very friendly French and helpful owner Arnauld and professional staff"
"Got there lat in the day with the intention of coming back the next day. Found there was plenty of interesting objects but little information. Why not a guide book to purchase when you arrive, rather than a 20th century history book of the country? Great pillars in the first chamber but the colours have been worn away by people being able to touch them."
"The best reason to visit Hue. Give yourself an entire day to take in the entire complex.

You can feel the layers of history as you walk around this place. It's an ancient structure and you can imagine how it must have been when it was the imperial palace grounds. The entire grounds are also pockmarked with craters and bullet holes from some of the most intense fighting of the Vietnam War. Most recently, you can watch restoration efforts happen in real time.

There aren't a ton of guide materials, so it might be working hiring a tour guide. Or just walk among the ghosts."
Much of this extensive site was destroyed and is currently being rebuilt. The few remaining original buildings are interesting but need a good guide to bring them to life
Visited the Citadel and had a look at the history of the palace. Various part of the huge complex have been restored and more areas are undergoing restoration work now. Very interesting visit and learned a bit about the early dynasty's and the history of the palace. Only saw a small part of the total complex but found it interesting.
"Walked all over on a very hot day , but there is shade in the building, tour was good lots of information to read , big area so be prepared to walk alot"
"Get past the cyclo touts and you are in!
We enjoyed the stroll around the pathways and stopped in on the various temples. Much is being rebuilt after the imperialists bombed it and you are never allowed to forget that.
There is an expensive electric car tour if you are not up to walking around 5ks in the heat."
"I was really surprised by the size and extent of the citadel. It is vast and has some very interesting architecture including the massive wall around the perimeter. We took refuge in a quiet little cafe nearby and our fitter companions explored the depths and gave it as one of their best highlights of our tour.
The remnant museum houses demobilized weaponry and some very fascinating ancient 9 inch canons.
I certainly recommend tourist include the citadel in their itinerary and leave about 3 hours for a ""reasonable"" view of all it holds.
There is a fee for the inner sanctum...but apparently well worth it"
"There'a not much to see inside the Citadel. Maybe because some parts of it are still being restored. Perhaps in the next months, it would look a lot more interesting, but for now, if you're short on time (or money), skip this and visit the tombs instead."
"Absolutely loved the ancient citadel. It's a large are of land with various significant buildings playing a huge role in Vietnam's history.
Most of the hotels/hostels are across the Perfume River, so you'll either have to book a tour or go by cyclo, taxi etc. however, walking is just 20-25 minutes away.

Entrance fee is 150.000vnd adults and inclusive also of the museum nearby.

You can go around and have a informative session with a tour guide which is highly recommended since its way better than reading general facts on the signs.

You'll have to prepare for the heat and tons of walking around."
Hue is a really cool place in vietnam with lots of bars and restuarants. The city has a much nicer atmoshpere than hanoi. The citadel is its main attraction however. The imperial city is impressive in its size but not in its grandure. I understand its come under plenty of stress from war and weather however there was plenty of work still to be done. That being said some of the buildings are very nice and there is a lot of good information about vietnamese culture and history.
This structure is 3 sq. Miles large. It is a fortress surrounded by a moat like a classic castle of Europe built by the Nguyen Dynasty in 1804. It was the capital city. The building in the palace are constructed in wood . The craftsmanship is impressive as the building still stand as they were built. This sight takes about three hours to visit
"Very interessant for history and viet culture.
The visit of imperial city is very important to understand the history of vietnam."
Thought it may be a bit like visits to Chinese palaces but no this was different and good to see restoration work in progress to a high standard.well worth the visit
One the most important parts of the vietnamese culture.gives you a insight how the king of vietnam lived.truly amazing
"A very beautiful place where you can find a lot of history of this lovely country. Unfortunately a lot of buildings were destroyed during the war, but it worth a tour."
"Enjoyed the Citadel & its History but felt it was overpriced for what it was. Enjoyed the visit .So pleased we had Hang as our guide. Her knowledge was incredible
Alan Emmerson
New Zealand"
"We spent the morning at the citadel on our first day in Hue. For 150,000 Dong each it's a little steep compared to other museum type attractions. I would have regretted not stopping in, but it was only mildly interesting. Do a little research before hand so you know what you are looking at there. The citadel is huge and there is not a lot of interpretive signage explaining what everything is. A tour might have been helpful, but after spending 300,000 dong on entrance we couldn't justify the cost. It was a good experience, but if you have to pass it up for some reason do not feel you missed out on too much."
Good historical site to walk about for a few hours. So do take sunscreen and water with you. Because the site is quite large - it did not feel crowded.
"Visited the Citadel in August with my wife and 7 year old daughters. This is a pretty large area to get round and will take you 2 - 3 hours.
Make sure you have good shoes to walk in and plenty of drinks, please also be aware when it is hot there is not much shade (quite a few large open areas)
You enter via the impressive Ngo Mon gate and then within one of the first buildings there is a video explaining the history of the Citadel.
You then wander round at your leisure taking in some beautiful buildings and history.
Also within the Citadel there is the smaller purple city with small temples and again well worth seeing.
Due to buildings that were damaged during the Vietnam war, there is quite a bit of restoration work taking place. Please do not let this put you off visiting this place.
There are quite a lot of similarity to the forbidden city in Beijing.
We paid for a combination ticket (before we entered one of the tomb sites) which included the Citadel and visits to three tomb sites, this worked out to be quite a bit cheaper then paying at each site. We could also use this ticket spread over two days.
Remember to bring your camera
I would certainly recommend visiting this place if you are in Hue"
"Huge place, but not as detalied as other similar places. Make sure to bring water as it will take a while to walk around the whole thing."
"We were left a little underwhelmed by our visit to the citadel. It seemed overpriced for what it was, a few buildings with not much else to see really. The video in the first building was good and there were some informative displays on the life of the emperors, but the rest was a bit boring to be honest. Could happily have given it a miss!"
"It was crowded, people everywhere! We went at about 11am and I would suggest going early in the morning as it is really hot and it doesn't offer much shade!
There are a lot of buildings under re construction at the time we went so it was noisy and parts were blocked off

There is very little information about the buildings and ruins so I would also suggest buying the tickets with a tour guide but for what it is, it's quite expensive 150,000 VND PER person non guided 350,000 VND per person guided!
There are a lot of fish but the ponds are quite dirty!
It's massive clear a few hours to get around the hole lot!"
It was really interesting to understand how old this place is. Takes about 1/2 hours to see everything..
"If you visit Hué, you should go to the Imperial City. At the beginning you'll find the impressive entrace gate. After that you almost directly find the most impressive building (Thai Hoa Palace), with the throne of the emperor.
After this you can walk in and around the remains of the purple city, some temples and a few exhibits. You'll get a good insight in the way of life of the emperor and the royal family.

The fee to get in is with 300.000D a bit higher than the most other places in Vietnam, but truly worth the price. Sadly, th
e wars and natural violance destroyed a big part of the city. Restorations are ongoing, so you see directly where the money is going."
"We went to the citadel at 3pm and really enjoyed exploring the buildings and ruins without hoards of people. As the sun lowered it was even more beautiful. It closes at 6 but we went for a walk around the perimeter after and got to see all the locals using the grounds for recreation and family gatherings.

Be aware its 150k each. Its not a lot but if like us you head there after a big lunch you may be counting your 1s and 2s to try and get a ticket"
"Worth the 150k visitors fee to get it. You can just wonder around and see a mixture of older ruins and the ones which have been restored.

There is also alot of information on Vietnam and its history"
"This place is fantastic, with our guide spent around 1 1/2 hours looking and learning about it. There are some renovations being done but didn't deter from this beautiful place."
"Due to 'that' fairly recent historical event, a good proportion of this complex has been faithfully and accurately restored, brick by brick and beam by beam. But don't let this put you off visiting this visually stunning piece of architecture.
A couple of hours is needed to make the most of this Palace and absorb it's fascinating history. Personally I would suggest a private guide rather than joining a large tour group ( if possible) And don't forget your camera, it's a photographers dream.
There's a modern air conditioned cafe within the grounds, which is a godsend in the oppressive heat that Hue can conjure up during the summer months.
The reconstruction of the Citadel is an ongoing project, and you can see current restoration projects being worked on.
Highly recommended"
"An agent arranged tour was just the thing. A large and imposing area of ancient building and with an English speaking guide this was a really interesting day. This is a very hot and close location so water is a must.
If you look to visit this site alone I would recommend a good two hours to see all you can and be prepared to see a lot of renovations and improvements....and if with children look out for the elephant, tortoise and Phoenix cut into the bushes."
"The Hue Imperial City was an amazing trip,we spent a good 2 hours buzzing around got some killer photos while learning a good deal on the history of the Ngyuen Dynasty."
The Citadel is a beautiful city. You could easily spend 2-3 hours exploring the grounds. It's amazing that it is in as good shape it is in despite the war. Depending on the time of year it could be a hit stroll through the grounds. Overall a must see.
"Yes, it's not particularly we sign posted and yes there are some empty spaces to wander through but it's well worth the visit. There are clear similarities with the forbidden city in Bejing, but Bejing didn't suffer the same level of recent damage due to war and revolution. Some of the museums are well kept, while others are kept in a sorry state."
"We was very lucky to get to hue on The 02/09 ! Vietnam national day! All domestic visitor come in for free! The citadel were so pack of tourist! The complex is too big to roam, you will need a day to finish! Not recommended on a sunny day you will not enjoy getting lost in the mid day heat!"
Relax place .nice for 2 hours go with taxi in case .entrance fee is hight a bit so old and charming .good
"You can easily spend 3 hours or more in the citadel. It's huge and there are many palaces, villas and other interesting buildings within to explore. It does get very hot though, so do bring enough water to stay hydrated. Information on each building is available on boards so you can do a self-guided tour at your own pace. They also have a place for women to try on ao dais (the traditional clothing that's still worn by Vietnamese women), which was an interesting experience."
"Although over 75 % site were damage during war bewteen vietnam and US, some construction recovering still under progress, it was still an attractive old ruins you must visit at Hue,"
"Although a lot has been destroyed by the French war (the French seemed to have dropped a lot of bombs on the Citadel), there is a lot present, and just provides you the feeling of how it was during the Imperial times.
What you should not miss: 1) after the main buidling (where the invitees of the imperor came together), you have the building at your right where you have all kind of photographs and explanations. 2) get a the bottom end of the citadel, turn at your left at the lakes, and get to see the imperial palaces of the mother's imperor and the imperor. It looks like it is out of the citadel but it isn't. There are three citadels one in the other... Be prepared to walk q lot since the citadel is bigger you think. Take at least 1/2 day to visit everything.
Enjoy !"
If you are doing this independently make sure you watch the video for a quick but essential overview. A cyclo ride back completes the journey and offers a dose of fun adrenaline as you watch hundreds of motor bikes heading towards you at an intersection all of whom somehow manage to avoid an accident. We had a great 1.5 hrs here.
It is definetely worth visiting this place. Especially if you have already visited China and Korea palaces. We had a private guide and enjoyed learning more about history.
"The citadel is huge. We did it without a guide since our book gave lots of info. There's a great movie about the citadel and the history behind it. Must of been an awesome time to be a king then. Some parts are under construction, guess it will be even better in 2 years from now. We spent about 2 hours here."
"My daughter and I rented bikes at our hotel, The Alba, and rode to the Citadel, parked the bikes, and spent a good four hours walking around in awe of the thousand + year old history here.
It was good to see the reconstruction efforts actively underway. I like seeing this kind of work going on.
This Imperial City site was bombed during the Vietnam war and damage is still evident today. Sad to see what remains of the rich ancient architectural history that was destroyed during the war with France, then the US and now the environment.
None the less, what remains of the Imperial City is massive and spectacular.
I learned a lot about Vietnams history here and took many pictures.
Well worth the time and incidental costs in my opinion!"
"If you love to wander around daydreaming with a camera, this is a fantastic place to do it in Viet Nam. Make sure you find the correct side of the walled citadel to enter into or it is quite a walk to have to go around to the other side. Once inside, you'll find it is bigger than it looks."
"Most of the buildings are in perfect condition, with their unique decorations of broken porcelain and glass.
One can find ""on the walls"" lot of info about the structure and the mentality of the kingdom, the level of its culture.
What i found more touching was the restauration of the bombed and demolished constructions of the citadel . What a fighting nation !"
"We walked around our guide tried to tell us all about it but it was too hot . Alot to see . Nice informative bit . That shows you how it once was like , helps you to visualise what it was once like . I took alot of photos here . Interesting"
"We actually thought this place was really neglected, just empty shells of buildings in red paint so bring your imagination with you. Very little atmosphere due to the crowds, even the gardens were neglected. The local authorities should be ashamed if this place is important to them. Also all of these building look the same, these are replicas not originals. we used the visit to get some exercise walking around."
"Hué was a little bit of a disappointment. There is not much to see besides some pagodas and the citadel. As Vietnam is overloaded with pagodas there is no point going there. The citadel can be nice if you're die-hard interested in history, otherwise it will be terribly boring. Besides, the citadel is not very well maintained and some parts look quite ugly actually.

The nightlife of Hué made my stay a bit more pleasant. Hué has some nice bars with western music where you can have nice drinks for reasonable prices. I went to Brown Eyes Bar and had a great night!

Conclusion: there's no harm in skipping Hué as it does not add much to your trip."
"Worth a good day exploring around the old city. People who are adventure seekers probably won't get much for this, but if you love history - seeing it, learning about it then this is the place for you."
Really enjoyed the Citadel and looking the Old City - very large so you need some time. Lots of walking....highly recommended - also did a Cyclo tour of some of the outside
"The ""must do"" of Hue. Do take the official guide with you - it is a fixed rate (not much) and very informative."
"When in Hue it is absolutely a must to visit the citadel.
It is a huge site with a very large park area, interesting sights and a lot of history.
Is was good to have a guide to learn more about the place and the country."
"Expected more, was pretty and some good photo ops
Other than a video at the beginning it was not very informative and so lost interest when we didn't know what we were looking at"
"We were wowed and impressed by the sheer size of the city. it is definitely a must see, however much of it is now empty space which is disappointing."
"The imperial city has many attractive buildings, I liked very much the theatre and also the garden, with lots od bonsais."
Enjoyable day walking about the citadel grounds and learning about Vietnamese culture. Have to pay to get into the main part but worth a look. Restoration is an ongoing project but was actually good to see things in all different stages of this. Also marked on maps were buildings that don't exist anymore.
"This imperial city was a pleasure to explore! After Hanoi, Hue was a culturally surprise for us. We didn't expect that that the city has this many interesting and beautiful ancient places! The Imperial City is surely one of them!"
"It is not terrible but in my opinion it's bad. A lot of buildings are not renew yet(they restore it for 20 years now).
It's funny how in throne hall (or rather room) hats, shoes and making photos are forbidden. I assume it somehow offens the self-proclaimed emperor's throne :) And yet 30 meters further in different room was a replica of this throne, and you could wear an emperor clothes, sit on the throne and have a professional photo:D
The only building I really liked was the theatre. Also there are few nice gardens (with trees and ponds) but grass in not mown so it's little harsh to walk.
If you're only one day in Hue or you travel budget - you should skip it and spend more time in marvelous tombs around the city. Waste of time and money."
The citadel was huge!! Good to know it is getting repaired after bombings during the wars!! You could spends hours there if you had time.
"The citadel was really impressive. There's the opportunity to dress up in traditional clothing and get a picture as a souvenir. A small band were playing in the gardens. Be careful to cover up or wear suncream because there's limited shade, but there's a shop selling refreshments if you need to rehydrate."
"The Imperial Citadel is a large gated complex, of the ruins of the ancient city. Be prepared to walk a lot, as this took up our entire afternoon. Not many options to eat within this attraction, so definitely start after lunch / breakfast."
Larger than expected - not least due to poor sign posts. Highlights were certainly the emperor's mother's complex or buildings and the old gardens. When it is hot it can probably take you easily 3-4 hours to cover the majority. When colder quicker. If visiting Hue this is an absolute must.
"Didn't have a lot of time in Hue so decided an hour on a cyclo ride to see all the free sites that were still open (it was getting late in the afternoon) was the best way to go. Plus the kids deserved a break from walking in the heat for the previous week.

We paid $10 per cyclo for an hour. Our guide was funny and knowledgable and took us back to our hotel after our tour."
Best to visit late afternoon or early morning as there is little shade available. Very interesting tour
"The citadel is quite an extensive area with many old buildings. Many have been kept in original condition, some have been fully restored and still others are in the process of reconstruction. We only had a quick visit if a couple of hours on tour but I think you could spend a day or more if you had time. Truly amazing site that will rival the forbidden city in Beijing when complete. Apparently the same architect built both."
"Brilliant historical site that has an amazing past. Many photo opportunities, a 'must' place to visit whilst in Hue"
"This was a good place to come and see some of the history of Hue, and was especially nice that the grounds are so open that you can take your time and wander at will.
Lots of information available"
The supreme city is astonishing with exceptionally decent reestablished structures The visit is truly worth to find the Vietnamese history
Its a rather large place to visit so put aside ample time and a whole lot of sunscreen! Great documentary/virtual tour on arrival and just a very clean and organised place. Great to learn about the beautiful history of Hue! Don't miss it!
"I notice reviews of same area under 9 Dynastic Urns and Purple Forbidden City; these are part of the Citadel. These have the status of UNESCO's World Heritage Site for important historical reasons, Hue was the capital of Vietnam and the Imperial City was the seat of governing up until 1945. Good movie to rent is INDOCHINE (1992) - many scenes were filmed in the Imperial City, Hue and Northern Vietnam, depicting VN as a French colony in the 30's. Entrance is inexpensive 150,000. Don't be in a hurry to walk the grounds. It is not air con; there are concessions to buy a cold drink. Bring your camera."
"The Imperial Citadel is the must-see site in Hue, and it didn't disappoint. Not all buildings restored, but plenty have been. Our family group (age range 2-61) spent about 4 hours and felt we had a pretty comprehensive visit. Take water and sunhats, and buy cold drinks at various locations inside."
"It is sad that nowadays there are not to many buildings standing inside the citadel, because of the war. but it is a nice trip to know more about their history."
"The main monument of Hue. Lot of palaces, tombs and interesting sites in the real heart of Hue. The area includes restructured palaces and temples. Half of the palace in in ruin due to the bombing during the second world war. Other areas are. It requires almost 4/5 hours visit the area."
Definitely worth a visit! Shame some of the information plaque's are old and unreadable! But what a place! Great place with so much history! Get lost In here for a couple of hours! Plenty of places to get drinks around which was very helpful!
"you cant visit Hue and not visit the imperial city . Its a great outing . Full of the history , good to do with a guide .Can get rather hot there so take your water"
My family & I really enjoyed visiting the Citadel. We had a tour guide and it was very interesting to hear the history behind the place. He took us away from the large touristy crowds and showed us other areas that we probably wouldn't have seen if we'd stuck to the main areas. Very interesting and worth visiting.
"Can't express how much I liked it! For 150k, you'll immerse into a property which reigned the country 70 years ago. Almost all of the buildings have been restored to their entirety. Take your time strolling around and you'll discover the very beauty of this place. Recommended!"
"This must have been incredible in its day but upkeep is very difficult.
You need good legs, lots of water and at least an hour after u pay 150.000 to get in. If you are in hue it's an easy place to get to."
We walking around of the imperial city for more than 1 hour. It's nice time for sightseeing and a little know about the history of Vietnam.
"Huế central Viet Nam is often known for the Perfume river, Kings' tombstone historic sites, Imperial City (The Citadel) etc. My recent visit to Huế has helped me to explore more about the local's lifestyles. It is a gentle old world charm city if anyone's looking for a relaxing time and inspiration. The locals are humble and very respectful, best of all they love their Huế. For a brief two days there, I had the opportunity to soak in the surrounding of the rice field to the horizon, the amazing sky clouds all into one another like an incredible artwork. Riding scooters through the village, stopped by the road watching the sunset and visiting the local food market is another highlight. Men and women work in the field with their conical hats on 'Nón lá' is a sweet and memorising scene. Huế is a photogenic city if you like photography or just emerging with the local life. I should also mention their delicious and super low priced food. Lowest ones compared to other cities in Vietnam (not that other places were expensive). If you travel Viet Nam and enjoy the historic, old charm architecture and the rural scene then Huế is a must visit city."
A large place with many interesting features. You need at 2 hours to see properly. If a hot day ensure you take some water.
"I can only imagine the original glory of the Imperial City - but sadly time and mainly the Vietnam War destroyed much of the magnificence of this place. An extensive amount of work has gone into its restoration, but I found this experience lacking with so little of the original history left to be seen. Interesting to see, with great work going into bringing this history back to life, but overall nothing to write home about."
"Be prepared for a lot of walking, bring water, sunscreen, and spare camera batteries.

Entrance fee 150,000 VND per person, Citadel complex only. Paid at the booth inside the first wall on the South side, I think there are other entrances as well. There is a person to check tickets at the actual entrance.

This is a large complex, several significant sites can be easy to miss if you rush through.

Go early to avoid crowds and heat."
"Went to this place in the morning. Entry tickets were VND150,000. Did our own walkabouts. Some interesting exhibits but nothing that had any wow factor. There's a nice garden with a little cafe inside. Overall, a nice place to drop by if in Hue."
"I spent 2 hours wandering around The Citadel and I think another 2 hours could of easily been spent there taking in the rich history of the area and people. Because of it's open spaces the heat does come into play when walking around, however, there are some shady areas to catch some relief."
"When in Hué, you must certainly visit the citadel. Very big, so it takes some time to get around. Can be very hot."
"What more can I say. This was so interesting. True piece of history.
Needed to spend longer.
Although again take an umbrella.
Don't recommend flip flops - quite a bit of walking.
Not temple therefore women - don't need to cover shoulders. Although removal of sunhats required"
"We had a decent look round, there is parcels to see, however a significant number of the structures are either ruins or experiencing redesigns. I can just envision this spot is going to get more excellent however it's unquestionably justified regardless of a visit."
"Worth a look around, scale is impressive and the literature on the history is both interesting and comprehensive. Lots of places to have a drink in the shade if needs be."
"Never did I expect to learn about the Nguyen Dynasty that once ruled Vietnam. The visit to the Imperial City was an eye opener. It would be good to visit this place with a good guide to have a better understanding. Our guide unfortunately was not so engaging may be due to the hot day.

We entered the Imperial City from the North Gate which was impressive compared to the South Gate. The City was divided into various sections, the LEFT, the RIGHT and the CENTRE. We did not explore much of the LEFT or the RIGHT but mainly concentrating the CENTRE. I have attached a photo of the layout of the City to give you a good grasp of the City.

Don't forget to read about the history of the Nguyen Dynasty in one on the hall. It was quite interesting studying Vietnamese history. There was a digital constructed video about the City. They could have screened the video in a room with air-con for comfort from the hot summer heat. Instead, it was screened in a corner of a hall with few benches and fans.

There was a performance theatre to showcase the Vietnamese culture. You could also visit the King throne or photo taking with the Vietnamese costumes.

It was a worth while visit. We did not spend enough time to really appreciate the big space. Do allocate at least 3 hours if you want to cover the whole area."
"The place can be very crowded and hot, but if you go early morning, then the whole palace is belong to you."
"Everyone who visits hue should visit the citadel. It is such a beautiful place!
You can also buy a combi ticket and visit the graves as well."
"The Citadel are very large, i spent 4 hours to visit all main places there. Nice characteristic of architecture and impressive history of Kings in Hue. Highly recommend to go"
"The citadel is the main attraction of Hue. The walls are build from 1800 and gave space for more then 150 buildings. Now a days is this an city in rebuild. There are some beautifull buildings left and they try to give an inside in the lifestyle in time of Nyguen dynastie. I guesse it is the most interesting to enjoy the side in te cooler morninghours, and with the company of a enthousiastic guid. We went at a sunpeak and that was way to hot.

The entryfee is 150k/pax and if you're hungry after youre trip? We had a great burger at Geylang's a little place in the street near the exit. With a really friendly owner."
Beautiful scenery of the imperial capital for photographs and there's a place you can try on royal costumes for photos ops
"The Citadelle and the Palace are amazing due to its sheer size and what we can still perceive was the grandeur of old times
Part of the palace is still being restored but the part that is ready is outstanding and reminded us of the forbidden city in Beijing
Definitely not to loose"
If you have any interest in history you will love this place. It is beautiful but also shows scars of war and typhoon. We had a guide but liked that much signage was in English.
"The entrance fee was 150k VND but the cashier was happy to take advantage of a naive tourist, luckily i noticed i had overpaid her 3 fold and the woman hesitantly handed back my notes. Despite this the city itself was fantastic and a lot bigger than i had imagined with lots to see. I recommend taking plenty of water since the prices inside are a lot higher. From my experience i'd recommend going by yourselves that way you can wander round and enjoy the city as well as being able to wander into parts of the city which aren't part of the tour and aren't quite as popular with tourists.
Highlight of my trip to Hue!"
We expected something for the money but. .. unfortunately they don't use the income for a proper restauration. Many buildings were in a bad state and there is little to none English information around.
The efforts to repair this world treasure are praiseworthy. Those who lamented the destruction of Palmyra might wonder why similar outcries weren't made 50 years ago about the ruin of this Vietnamese cultural icon
"Impressive place, you can feel the history of it seeing the damaged parts but the restored parts are really nice, lots to see, I was a bit rushed as it was part of a tour"
The royal stronghold is stunning! The development is the most intriguing spot to visit in Hue. It took me the entire morning to stroll around I still lamented to not completely find it.
"Definitely The only thing truly worth visiting in Hué, Vietnam.

150,000 is a little overpriced in my opinion to see this former home of the ancient ruler's of Vietnam, but is definitely a beautiful place for a wonder when you are in Hué.

If you are going to go, definitely give yourself 90 minutes to two hours to walk around the entire grounds, and go early in the morning or later in the afternoon as the middle of the day is really hot, which i learned the hard way."
This palace have many story. You must to visit when you come to Hue. If you want to tour around in palace you can buy hourse carriage service to sightseeing and take a one stop on palace at the end of hourse carrige tour will drop you on exit way. Don't miss Cyclo of vietnam to tour around street of palace.
"It is quite a nice place to wander through and look at the history of this place,they are trying to restore a few buildings,not a lot of steps so a nice walk."
"This is a must see, and you should reserve a few hours for your visit. There is a lot to see and to read and we loved just strolling around and look at all the details at the buildings. Very interesting."
The citadel is worth a visit! The buildings are beautiful. The whole citadel complex is interesting. Not everything is rebuilt but you get a good impression what it looked like before it was destroyed. There are some nice old pictures of the emperor and the daily life in the citadel too. You should plan one and a half hours or two hours for the visit.
"Worth seeing, although the place can be maintained a bit better...there was some plastic in the water."
"If you are going to Vietnam, don't miss this place to feel the ancient culture and advanced knoeledge and wisdom of that time."
Great place to visit but hot s hell so drink lots of water. Also far bigger than you can imagine so you finish up wet and very tired
"Visiting the Citadel was a great cultural experience with significant historical value. You can walk around the premises for an hour and still haven't seen everything; it's that big.

Despite multiple buildings and temples being severely damaged or destroyed in the American War, there is still a lot to see - and they're even rebuilding and repairing things now so it should be even prettier in the near future.

Well worth a visit when you're in Hue."
"We did enjoy our visit here despite the very hot day. The citadel has some cool places and is very calm and relaxed inside. Our main criticism is not many signs inside and there was only a limited general introduction, but perhaps we should have paid extra for a tour guide.
Top tip: take a picture of the map to the left of the main entrance ticket booth and use this to navigate. It was small enough to stroll around in 2 - 3 hours.
Price: 150,000 vnd for adults"
What incredible people these must have been.The architecture is amazing.To see that most of the buildings are still standing after all these centuries is nothing but a tribute to the craftsmanship of the times.Well done to the people involved in the preservation of these treasures..
"The imperial palace is a must see. Allow at least half a day to stroll around at a relaxed place. There will be opportunity to get a fresh drink or even eat something inside. The buildings have been restored after the bombing during the war, the restoration work was done beautifully. When you buy the standard ticket you get free access to the museum which I also recommend."
A must visit when in Hue. A sense of another period in time. Great to see so much restoration going on. Some lovely gardens too.
"While staying in Hue centre we booked a day trip to visit 4 of the royal tombs and the palace of the last Emperor that live there when he abdicated.

Although we rushed around at 100 mph it was amazing to see so much and learn about the history of the area. My 11 year old daughter found it exciting as well as interesting running around trying to find where the bodies were buried.
We stopped for a buffet lunch which is included in the cost and watch some martial arts demonstration which was lovely and scary to see what they do and how they train. In the afternoon we travel to the pagoda to see the monks singing and preying, leaving a few Dong as a gift for them.
To round off the day we sat in a dragon boat and traveled down the river.

This was not expensive and well worth a day out from swimming, having clothes made or eatting."
"We had travelled from Hoi An to Hue and visited the Citadel as well other things. Very amazing place and oozes with history. A lot of the buildings have either been destroyed or damaged in the war but you can see from a model of the site how it would have looked. If you are in to history, this is definitely a must visit place."
"Some impressive buildings and it's a great feeling to walk around freely through the whole complex. It's left in a natural state which in my opinion is a great bonus.
It might look too big to walk around in the beginning but it really isn't that much - we didn't take the tour electric car and were glad!
Get there early!"
"If you go to Hue you'll go to the citadel. This place is must see when you plan your trip. Had a morning visit to this old site and enjoyed the experience. Fascinating how sophisticated this system was. The citadel is extremely large, it was fun to get lost inside. Gives a good impression of life circumstances for emperors. We spent half a day walking around the compound looking at the different buildings. The Citadel is rich with history, both recent and ancient."
"We had a good look round, there is lots to see, however many of the buildings are either ruins or undergoing renovations. I can only imagine this place is going to get more beautiful but it's definitely worth a visit."
"The imperial city is amazing with very nice restored buildings
The visit is really worth to discover the Vietnamese history"
Grand in scale. Needs more money spent on restoration and cleaning up of the surrounding area with the money they ask of us tourists!
A visit to the Imperial City was historically rewarding. The City itself has suffered the ravages of war and many structures have been destroyed. But some of them are now being reconstructed based on old photographs. The lacquer finish on the walls were exquisite.the detailed maps and writings gave a very good idea of the life in the Imperial city. A must visit for tourists.
We spent a fascinating day wandering the Imperial City. The heat was extraordinary but that made us appreciate more how it had been built to catch the breeze. Shocking to see the bomb damage from the American war. Really gave us a sense of Vietnam in the not so distant past.
This large historic complex is well worth a visit if you are in Hue - and even if you aren't. We hired a car for a day and drove from Hoi An to see the Imperial City. It's large and impressive even if the history does not go too far back. In terms of scale it is like a poor man's version of the Imperial City in Beijing and so worth a visit on that basis. However it's big and it's hard work getting a good look and a feel for the place on a hot day. The day we were there it was 38 deg. C and my wife wilted after about half an hour and said you go ahead I will wait for you here. There are large open areas and paved courtyards and it was quite oppressive. Plenty of water required. If you are lucky to be part of an organised tour group you would be taken around in a stretch electric golf cart which would make it a bit easier - but alas it was walking for me. The other issue I had was the lack of good directional signage. There is obviously a sensible route around the place but it is not really displayed or evident - and the place is so big you need a bit of guidance. Vietnam Tourism or whoever is in charge take note - you should get a decent map of the place when you buy your entry ticket and there needs to be better signs for a walking tour that covers the main attractions. Well worth a visit but be mindful of the size of the place on a hot day and see if you can scare up a layout plan before you get there.
"We went on a very hot day enjoyed the temple but u really need to take your time, but was glad to leave and get back to the beach."
"I came Hue 3 months ago and everything is good - good place - people and streetfood also ...
Highly recommended !!!!!!!!!!"
Lots of fun and incredibly informative. Fantastic insight to the history of this beautiful city. Not to expensive and quite breathtaking. A great first stop on the trip to Hue.
"Visited on a very warm and humid day with our Vietnames tourguide. It is worth walking around with a guide that can tell you a lot of details, that makes it so much more interesting.
You can spend up to one and half hour here."
The Citadel is big and well maintained. Take guide and buggy tour if you want to see all. This give a full view of the kingdom. A a paradise lost.
"Anyone going to Hue must visit the Citadel of Hue.

It is similar to the Forbidden City of Beijing in China. It carries a lot history and culture of Vietnam. In order to benefit from this visit, you should read more about the Nguyen Dynasty, which is the last dynasty of Vietnam."
"Go because:
+Lots to see - It should occupy half a day.
+Photography hot spot - old structures and patterns fill the city
+Love open spaces
+Likes wall reliefs and delicate carvings
+Vietnam war significance - some structures has bullet holes
+Historically significant - was the home of Nguyen dynasty rulers

Avoid if:
-Not to much fun for kids
-You want something active
-Don't like lots of walking
-Dislike construction as some locations are still being restored
-You don't like to deal with some crowding"
"Really nice entrance, but inside is poor and pale. Most artifacts are replicas and some reconstructed structures. Seen way too many country-side pagodas that look better than any of what this place has to offer, 150000 dong entry price also doesn't help...
save your time and money"
"A lot of history here. A bit expensive fit what it is but obviously the money being out to good use, some of the staff are a bit rude but the sights are amazing. Enjoying history would make it a lot nice. Bring a hat and water as it can get very hot."
"Stunning and atmospheric. Young kids loved the atmosphere, less so the exhibition on civil service documentation...! Great place and for us at least a highlight"
Interesting when it's about vietnamese history but it's not one of those spectacular places you would remember after leaving Southeast Asia
"we went to see this delightful site on a very hot day,hoping most others would not visit because of the heat,correct!!no crowds,just us two and a few others to see this magnificent place,so much beauty to take in,the most remarkable woodwork,the exhibits in the buildings were truly grand,the photos of a very different era,all so very good to see,then to walk along the waterways,totally by ourselfs was really so very nice.such peace,such beauty,we will always remember this really special place,"
"Great place to escape the hawkers and cyclos, 100000 entry for an adult which gives access to the royal museum as well. Can be quite stuffy in some areas as it is sheltered. The gardens are a must as they are so peaceful. As with most tourist attractions in Vietnam Friday's and Monday's seem to be days off so a good time to go without the restoration workers making noise. More and more buildings are opening. Lonely planet said the reading room was closed but it is now open."
Found the citadel while walking around. Got a push bike tour and it was fantastic. Our guide lives in the citadel area and was a an 8 yr old during the war. Many stories and a fantastic insight into the area and its many gardens temples and paradise. Highly recommend using one of the locals to take you around for 150vnd best value ever
"Talk about a tranquil day?! I visited the Imperial City on a Sunday, arriving mid-morning. Aside from three or four guided tour groups, the other Citadel-goers were solo travelers, like myself, and couples and families peacefully exploring the palaces, temples, gardens and walkways on foot. No queues, no commotion, no hordes of tourists walking in phalanx formation.

There were times I was the sole person looking at an artifact, walking on a tree-covered lane or appreciating the intricate ceramic work of an archway.

The 150,000 VND admission is worth the price. The fees obviously help to restore and preserve this exquisite piece of dynastic history dating back to 1802, the beginning of the Nguyễn empire. Some sectors of the Forbidden City (living quarters of the emperors) are still under restoration, but you won't be cheated since that's not the majority.

Take several hours or more to enjoy this world heritage. There's plentiful shade for protection from the summer heat of Hue and many kiosks for buying cold drinks, albeit at a steep price.

This was my second visit, and I was pleasantly surprised to see so much progress. Thank you to the government of Vietnam and to UNESCO."
"Another interesting place to visit, also lots of clear signage to work your way arrange and appreciate the importance of the site. Refreshments available."
"When in Hue a must see.

In August extremely hot, go early with lots of water.

Large parts of the palace are modern rebuilds of sections destroyed in the Vietnam war. Would benefit from greater clarity of where original ends and rebuild starts. Personally preferred the unrestored parts.

Only spent about an hour here simply because it was so hot."
"Despite living in Vietnam for 3 years we never got to Hue. A holiday 16 years after we left gave us the chance to correct that.

The Hue Imperial City is world heritage site that is benefitting from a slow but steady restoration of the key buildings. We spent most of a very hot day looking around around and enjoyed every minute, despite the heat."
Great place to go . I knowed something about this dynastry. Valueable. You should come here . I will come back
"This was the most incredible surprise on our journey to Hue. The beautiful forbidden city and even more beutiful surrpundings of the firbidden city itself. Where people still lived their day to day life inside the massive first walls. Highly recommended, if not to enter the forbidden city, atleast to round the surroundings."
"This imperial city really was a huge place. The buildings are variously well restored or destroyed completely. It is well worth a visit to get a feel for how the rich folks lived.
It is so big that with a bit of patience you can get whatever view you want without people. This also means you can take a quiet moment to just be alone."
"It was very hot when we went but very interesting. Lots to see!

We had a guide for this trip, pretty essential unless you understand the language."
"If you are sightseeing in Hue -you need to get up early to try and avoid the extreme heat.Take a rickshaw along the perfume river and through the markets before stopping at this amazing attraction.
Even though there are many renovations being undertaken -it is very accessible.
Make sure you have plenty of water with you."
"Vietnam was unified under the Nguyen, hence the Nguyen dynastical period is considered one of the most historically significant periods of Vietnamese history.

Political power was centralised and in rested in Hue, hence its term as the old capital.

Everyone who comes to Hue has to see the Citadel. After been partially destroyed during the Vietnam / American War, the Imperial City has undergone on-going restoration ever since, and presumably for a long time to come.

A lot of the palace still bears the effects of war. Whole sections of the palace stand bare where buildings once stood. Of the structures that remain, it is interesting to see the older structures alongside colonial era French buildings. There is even an Imperial Tennis Court used by the late Emperor who apparently had an interest in Western sports.

I spent over 3 hours at the Citadel. There is a lot of expositionary text for people to read if they're interested. Other areas are not so well subtitled. They include the workings of Imperial Palace, as well as a gallery of biographies detailing the different Nguyen Emperors. While I did the Palace solo, I did notice a few tour groups. As with all tour groups, you usually get what you pay for. If I go back again, I would consider hiring a guide that goes along with one or two people.

In conclusion, take your time, appreciate the history and drink a lot of water."
This is a truly magnificent site to visit. Be sure to get a good guide to explain former layout and history. Incredibly evocative place and easy to imagine the scenes from history. Great place.
"Some great buildings with real history,
Not much more to say really,
Didn't really know what to do as you kind of wander round looking at pictures, would be better with guide but there wasn't any available on our trip"
"Very interesting historical site of the Nguyen Dynasty. Easy to walk in 1-2 hours. Vehicles cannot enter the grounds, so you must walk. Imperial City is accessible from across the river by tour, bikes, taxi or medium-long walk."
"Wow what an enormous city, need a good few hours to see it all if not more. A map of the city would be useful to be given when you buy the tickets. A must to see if in Hue"
"For me, it was well worth the detour to Hue to see Annam's little version of the forbidden city by day, and even to see local kids hover boarding on the big square outside by night. The lighting at night could be better, but is still nice."
"It's a nice citadel, but considering they are already 20 years into renovating (from the war), there is really not too much to see. Price is fair though and a nice place to hang out one or two hours."
The imperial citadel is amazing! The construction is the most interesting place to visit in Hue. It took me the whole morning to walk around and I still regretted to not fully discover it (due to my tight schedule).
"In truth, the buildings are beginning to look the same. There are generally a number of separate squares, some have symmetrical statues and some are falling apart. This place was no different except bigger. You have to do it, it's the heart of the City, but don't make yourself visit every single one."
Cool place to see to get some culture as there's plenty of temples and sights to see. Allow a few hours to walk around here and take plenty of water.
If you want to see it properly you will need about 3 hours. The citadele is massive. Ticket costs 150.000vnd. Make sure you go early in the morning if you don't want to melt!
"We stayed in Hue for one night. We spent the afternoon on the Perfume River on a dragon boat. Just went as far as the first
Pagoda, very reasonable 300,000 VND. The next morning we spent in the Imperial City. It's spread over a large area, some very impressive structures. Very, very hot,
take water and a hat. Would have liked to spend more time in this lovely city."
"I had been warned that after the Forbidden City in Beijing, the Imperial City would be a let-down. I found it complementary and spent an entire day strolling about. If you're planning on visiting the tombs, there's a two-day combo-ticket which will save you a few dongs."
"Very nice and big area. Good to see a part of the history of vietnam.

!!!But please dont buy water by the!!! !!!woman next to the ticket office!!!
!!!this is no real drinking water!!!
!!!She is filling and sealing the!!! !!!bottles by herself somewhere!!!"
"Average.
Not well maintained, some sites are overrated. If you're passing by Hue, then stop for a visit, but don't head to Hue just to visit the citadel, there's better things to see in Viet Nam."
"A really interesting attraction which is not unlike the Forbidden City in Beijing but on a much smaller scale. I would, however, recommend you have a guide to get the most of these fascinating buildings and temples as the English translations are sporadic. We had our visit to the Imperial City included as part of a tour with Hue Tours and we learned so much more as a result than we ever would on our own."
"I had arranged a one night stop in Hue for the family as part of our Vietnam trip. On reflection the family would have preferred an extra night in Hoi An.
I must admit I was drawn to the thought of the Imperial Citadel especially as I understood there had been some ferocious fighting there during the Vietnam war but that was of course one of the problems. There had been widespread destruction and as such much of the citadel is gone.
However as we were in Hue we did visit the Citadel - it was very hot and humid, two hours was plenty.
It is fascinating and quite spectacular but for me the highlight was the ""Co Ha gardens"" and the small cafe where we had iced tea and noodles.
The Citadel is of course large area but the focus is always on the ""imperial enclosure"" which is exactly what we did.
It was so hot the family refused to walk back to the hotel - we got a taxi!
Taxis are however very cheap!"
The Citadel is very impressive and interesting to wander around but there is very limited information (in any language) when there so I would recommend bringing a guide book of some sort if you want to learn or understand what you're seeing.
My son and I visited Hue during my three week trip to Vietnam. I did not see the Citadel when I was stationed there in 1968 so it was a very pleasant surprise. It reminded me of the Forbidden City in Beijing but on a much smaller scale. It is well worth seeing and I would encourage visitors to plan on at least half a day so they can explore the entire sitel
"This place is absolutely huge, and really shows the power that was held by the Nguyen dynasty. It really is a must see when visiting Hue. The dance show is unfortunately only offered at 10 am and 3pm.

There is a lot of walking required so plan on spending several hours. We were not given a map or anything to help with interpreting the site or finding our way around, so relied on our Lonely Planet guide.

We found the displays lacking in information, with just the bare minimum provided, so do a little research ahead of time or bring your own guide. The only food options we could find onsite were overpriced beverages and ice cream."
"The citadel and the whole compound offer so many things worth visiting, you could probably go there 5 times and would still find something new and astonishing. Especially the gates to the private yards of the royal family have so many lovely details."
When in Hué you should definitely visit this. But if you dont have time on your trip through vietnam you can skip this.
"Bring plenty of water with you and a hat. This was a great place to visit, lots of things to see and the sun is unforgiving. The buildings were in a pretty good shape, there are photo exhibitions covering various subjects and the gardens and the emperors rest places truly unique. Definitely pay a visit and have your camera charged and empty!"
"I found the Citadel generally well preserved (shame for the bombing that ruined it) and interesting. Lots of buildings to visit, requiring around 2 hours.
As for most archeological places, you really need a tour guide to fully grasp the history behind the buildings and enjoy.
Don't cheap out on that after you invested in hotel and travel!"
This is a must to visit in Hue. Make sure you get a private tour guide from the front gate (will need to tip them at end of tour) but leave a few hours to mooch around at your own pace as there is lots that isnt on the tour. Have lunch inside in one of the cafes as there isnt much around outside.
"Get there as early as you can to beat the heat. Well worth the visit and the climb up to the top. Very impressive buildings, set on the beside of the river. This place was really special. Consider taking a travel guide for the extra info though, because it's not always clear what's what. So that wasn't very nice. If you want to see most, you need to walk a lot and not all places have shade. Hue is a very nice city and there are many restaurants in the evening. We came to Hue specifically to visit and were not disappointed. The main gate - Ngo Mon Gate is large and impressive, once inside stand the 4 Deities cannons, massive artillery representing the 4 seasons. This place is interesting and well worth a visit."
"Definitely recommend getting a tour guide who can explain the background of the kings and how everything worked as there were other tourists who seemed less interested as they didn't know the back story.
Our tour guide made it so interesting to learn about the Kings and how the whole imperial city used to work. Beautiful buildings.
Was so good to see the bullet holes in a lot of the buildings too from the war!"
Very interesting place. Historical place with many things to see. Beautiful gardens and explanations about the history.
"If you have a sightseeing day, this is definitely the one you should go to! The history is amazing and is gifted with very beautiful architecture! Entry fee was 150,000 dong, approx $9 aud. Make sure you look at the weather and bring a hat and sunscreen because it was scorching hot when we went!"
"Good hotel, but the buffet is very poor.
The service is good and friendly. The room is ok. I will come back to living but not to have a meal."
The best way to visit this site is with a tour group. We booked an all day trip which included the other tombs and as well as the Citadel. This made the day very economical.
"All you get from this is the size of the piece of land that was filled with the Emperor's stuff... but this is neither ancient, nor well preserved, nor particularly interesting/informative. Unless you really love 19th Century (yes its a recent build) relics don't waste you time or D200k"
"There's an interesting history behind the place, and there are a decent number of information boards around the place to tell you about it.

The place is really, really big. But unfortunately most of it has gone due to bombing. It's really sad... and it also means that there isn't actually a HUGE amount to see... I can see that it'd be a nice place to sit down, and if the weather had been a bit better then I probably would have enjoyed it more.

Obviously a big deal for Hue - and let's be real, you're probably going to visit this place regardless of what I say about it. Because you have to, right? Yeah I guess so... but the unnecessarily high 150,000d entrance fee is pretty tough to stomach."
Well worth the visit and the climb up to the top. Very different to others that we visited proving they are not all the same.
If you are staying in Hue it would make no sense not to visit here. There are some great old buildings in a lovely setting. You'll get a feel for the history of the city and a bit of the country as a whole but not in an overwhelming way. We were there in august so it was very tranquil and relaxing working around (albeit ridiculously hot).
"I've only stayed in Hue for a night and I already felt like I'd seen enough. Nice city though and beautiful citadel
Nice to just stroll around"
"It cost 150000 dong to enter the Citadel. Inside there are many pagodas and temples to see. Beautiful scenery. Some of the buildings were destroyed during the war but they are continuing to rebuild a lot of it. There are many places within the wall to stop and get a drink as there is not much shade. It was 40° when we visited. There are lots of information boards. We spent approx 3 hours there, but you could spend a lot longer. We reached the Citadel by boat which cost is 40000 each."
"The citadel opens at 8am and at 11 the heat becomes unbearable. If you want to see most, you need to walk a lot and not all places have shade. Tip: start early.
A lot was destroyed during the war and a typhoon but much is very nice restored. The expositions in the buildings are worth looking at.
We would have appreciated more overview maps and explanations. Also the price for drinks/bottle water is 2.5 times more than on the outside, and with this heat it might be wise to bring a lot.
Definitely worth a visit. Bring your book to have information.

We found Hue the most annoying city in Vietnam for harassing the tourists trying to sell stuff. Especially the bicycle-taxis get on your nerves. So be warned for this local army when leaving the gate from the citadel."
"This sprawling complex is the essential site to visit when in Hue. Set near the bank of the Perfume River, the Imperial City features temples, palaces, imperial libraries and ornate walkways. It is Vietnam's equivalent of the Forbidden City and well worth several hours of your time. Sadly, some parts of the complex were destroyed during both the French and American Wars. You can see crumbled sections of the inner walls riddled with bullet holes. The Citadel is rich with history, both recent and ancient."
"A must see when visiting Hue it tell you of another side to Vietnam, its beginnings and culture.You could spend hours just exploring the place"
"From the outside entrance, it's hard to appreciate how large this place is. You think it's just the citadel until you see the Imperial entrance. You think it's just the Imperial entrance until you keep walking and it just goes on forever. You could easily spend hours here taking in the sites and taking photos. A must see while in Hue."
A peaceful quite place with beautiful buildings and surroundings. Wish I had more than just one hour to explore everything. Nice place to sit down for a while and chill.
"Really cool! Definitely worth a visit. Will keep you occupied for quite some hours. Consider taking a travel guide for the extra info though, because it's not always clear what's what."
Apart from the heat this was amazing! Beautiful old city sadly partly destroyed by the war. We had an amazing guide who was very knowledgable (My from Asiatica)!
"There are only a few buildings left, most had been destroyed in the war or fallen into disrepair, however the exhibits were interesting and the information on the life of the royalty was also informative."
"I had some experience would like to share with you. if you drive motorbike, you should to park the right of port. Because when you exit, you dont allow go out throught the entry. Price sticket have 2 types: 120,000đ for Vietnameses and 150,000đ for foregners. Thats fine. Lets come here and learning about culture and history of Vietnam."
"Lived our visit today to the Forbidden Palace at the Citadel in Hue. It was so interesting to see all the various buildings withing the Citadel. Our guide walked us through the palace as well as the gardens which we thoroughly enjoyed!
I'd highly recommend a visit there to anyone visiting Central Vietnam"
So beautiful architecture and preserved many historical monuments. I want to visit again and again in the future to learn more about information not know enough about the famous Palace in Hue. As well as the history of the last kings Nguyen Dynasty.
It was a Nice and special dat out. Entrance is not expensive. We bought a combi ticket for about 12 euro's for the citadel and the tombs
It is really big and vast over our thoughts. The staff are helpful. The sightseeing is so nice. We loved our time very much.
"Nit impressed. The Tien Mu Pagoda was a better and more genuine experience...and free. This was not worth the 150,000VND."
"Like everything else in Hue or Hoi An if you have dollars or euros, your money will go for miles. But if you don't work in these currencies, most tourists attractions can be expensive as the tours in both cities are way too expensive. It is claimed that the money will be reinvested in restoring the sights but some parts are really neglected. For instance, in one year, the four tombs went from 25,000 to 100,000 viet dong. The agencies and government are really milking these sightseeings. If you don't mind spending overpriced tours and tickets, you should definitely visit all of them."
"The Citadel is a great example of traditions gone by. Some fantastic restoration work shows a glimpse of how the emperors once lived. The shear size of the Citadel is quite large but there are plenty of shady spots to take breaks from the heat. The cost per adult was $15 NZ and was worth the cost.
I would recommend visiting the Citadel."
We spent half a day walking around the compound looking at the different buildings. There is some descriptions in english near the different sights which is nice.
"This place is a must-visit for anyone visiting Hue. The history behind each part of the palace is amazing. Make sure you have lots of water, it gets hot. Also if you have a tour guide that helps so that you can understand the significance of each part."
"Very cool to wander through. Lots to see but there is hardly any information available. We brought our guide book so we would have an idea of what we were looking at. It's 150,000 per person to get in. There are a few stalls scattered throughout selling water and popsicles. Eventually we just got so hot we had to give up. The ticket price includes admission to the antiquities museum which is good for a quick look but also hardly any info.

It's interesting, but if this is the reason you're coming to Hue I'd add that day to somewhere else."
Quite a big place but nothing interesting inside. The entrance was quite expensive and not worth to buy. It was super hot as well and the buildings were not maintained properly
There was an exhibition of the writings of the last vietnamese king and his executive orders. Fascinating how sophisticated this system was.
"The animation film on the citadel, the museum, the city surrounded by the lotus ponds and Frangipani trees - it's nice; it's huge!

If you are traveling with small children in a HOT month like June, you might want to rethink."
It was one of my first times that I visited a place like this. There were not many people there and I felt a bit lonely but it was still nice because you can have a good walk around.
"Could definitely do with some more signage and guidance, not everyone wants to have to book a guide. Had no clue where to go and so there was a lot of wandering around aimlessly, with no signage, over a wide area. Bit overpriced for what we could see, but the video reconstruction was interesting."
A must visit this historical site if you are in Hue. Should visit with professional guide to enjoy the history of the citedel & the dynasty.
It's hot but well worth seeing. The architecture and surroundings are lovely and you don't get harrassed by touts. The entrance fee is reasonable and you will take lots of beautiful pictures.
We had a private tour with English speaking guide. This place was really special. Whilst alot of the buildings were restorations as the original buildings were ruined during war and weather there still are original buildings around. Interesting to see the buildings of the old dynasty.
"If you love history ,this is definitely worth to visit .it is spread on over large area and it is a big walk.but the old building are stunning and are rich ancient culture.we very love it .it is really quite fascinating.plan about 2 hours for visit.many original parts,some revonated."
"This amazing collection of buildings and courtyards shows the style in which the last Royal Vietnamese Dynasty lived. Surviving several wars, a burnt earth episode that saw several buildings razed to the ground, the loving preservation of this site is proceeding and will be a long term project. This does not prevent visiting the site which show s off the wonderful statuary, mosaics, sculptures and frescoes on various buildings, from being on display. It's almost a smaller, but not so pristine, version of its Chinese counterpart in Beijing.
Take good shoes for walking, you'll do a lot, water and a hat.
We loved this site. Allow two hours."
The whole complex is huge! Unfortunately there was much destroyed in the war but they are constantly reconstructing the buildings. It is very interesting to learn about this place! I would certainly go with a guide as there is so much information to learn. Put sunscreen on! It is very open and not always easy to find shade.
"Amazing buildings and gardens are shown here in the middle of hue. It was a great day out, it was almost empty it seemed! This made it even better as the perceived lack of people made it feel like your own personal palace"
"Interesting forbidden city, full of ruins, gardens and informative signs - however the Citadel is in a state of repair so isn't the most beautiful, this adds to it in someways and detracts in others. Worth a visit if you're looking to fill a day in Hue but I don't think you'll feel you've missed out if you don't make it. Beware of the local 'guides' nearby, unless you are particularly keen on the history you can easily wander around yourself and read the information signs dotted round. There's very little shade so I would recommend early morning or late afternoon if the weather is warm."
"Sadly a lot was destroyed in the war, but many beautiful temples and pagodas remain. The damaged parts are being repaired slowly.
Be aware that this place is huge and you need a few hours to see it all. I'd recommend taking buggy rides. We walked and it was so hot I began to feel unwell."
"A place to take your time and slowly meander around, reliving a way of life from the past. Need to take refreshments."
Very impressive facade but sadly there are shops within and I do wonder if the focus is more on commerce rather than conservation. My tip is to watch the video to get a sense of what it would have been like centuries ago and therefore enhance your experience.
"you can see a residence of old Emperor. Well, they promiss to rebuild some other buildings, that doesn't exists now."
This place is interesting and well worth a visit. Can be hot with the stonework so buy one of those cheap umbrellas and take your water. The video shows how this area is getting rebuild to its former glory. It will be awesome to see when completed.
"Wasn't as picturesque as I had hoped. Expected more for the money you pay to get in (150,000 VND). Probably worth going to but make sure you avoid middle of the day as was scorching hot"
"The royal citadel is a massive compound. As many have mentioned, a lot is gone due to war and nature, but there is a lot of potential there. Unfortunately very little of this potential has been realized.

There is very little information about any of the buildings or sites. Unfortunately there were no guides available for us, either. We ended up just walking around and looking at random stuff.

It's a nice place to wander around, but it could have been so much more interesting."
Spectacular sight. Gives a good impression of life circumstances for emperors. Our guide gave us interesting perspectives on Vietnam at the same time.
"A great example of restoration with an interesting history. Don't believe the cyclo riders, you can easily walk from Hue central in about 40 minutes. Yes, it's hot but you can buy water at a price and there are plenty of places to stop in the shade. We preferred to go at our own pace using the info in Lonely Planet or you could use Mr Google. Guides are available in most languages and you can hire a golf cart if necessary. You can see everything in 3 hours at a leisurely pace."
"The city is quite small compare to other ancient palaces in Asia such as the forbidden city in Beijing. And with poor maintenance, the whole place is actually a little messy and not really much to see. Still, part of Vietnam's history."
You can take a cyclo tour around the walls or walk inside but its just amazing to see a structure so old still standing. The lotus are beautiful as well
"Had no idea how vast the imperial City was until we went through. Had I known I would have taken large bottles of water and a picnic and would have spent a nice lazy day there in the shade somewhere. If it's sunny it is far too hot to walk around comfortably, hope for some clouds!"
Went with a tour guide. Very interesting and informative. Well worth going tolerance about Vietnam history as it comes alive being there.
I'm sure this was a grand Imperial Citadel in its time but now there isn't much to see as almost everything was destroyed during the war. The throne room is still there and a few ruins. If the weather is good you could have a nice stroll around the gardens
"Impressive restoration of one of Vietnam finest cultural sites. Excellent collection of artefacts daring back 200 years, detailed information on the inhabitants as well as gorgeous gardens to explore.
Strongly recommended"
Our taxi dropped us at exit gate and no body is allowed to enter from that gate so the taxi service providers should help the passengers to drop at correct location so that the tourist have better enjoyment as inside Citadel needs lot of walking and the family with small kids have to suffer a lot.
"The Citadel is probably one of the more touristy temples, but it is still worth a visit. The grounds are quite large, so be prepared to spend a bit of time there. It was great to hear about the history in the video and then we did a self-guided tour to see all the old buildings. Very interesting."
"There's not a huge amount to see here but pretty old ruins.

A guided tour may be a better option as there is not a huge amount of information around the area."
"Incredible place that would take hours to see all of. It would have been great to understand more of the history and significance of the imperial city and Vietnam in general beforehand, rather than showing up and having to google unanswered questions. It is really beautiful, however, so even if you're not interested in the history it would be a great place to walk around."
A must visit on a trip to Hue city rightly has been the center of power and control till it was destroyed by the french. This is also a part of the Hue city tour and the entrance cost is included along with lunch. The history of this purple city appears to be good however other than a few structures most of the parts have been destroyed. The theater is royal and intact after some restoration.
Beatiful sights surrounded by moats bedecked with striking lotus plants. Big sight to view so would recommend a guide.
"Very impressive architecture - even more impressive when you know most of it was destructed during the war and then renovated.
A guide would be ideal as he/she could give a but more information on the history of vietnam and this citadelle. Although some information (very little though) is provided so you should be able to find your way around.
Surprisingly quiet once inside."
You will need at least 3 hours at this site a must see on your itinerary. Site still being restored. The citidel and wall also impressive.
"The citadel is pretty much a compulsory visit if you are going to Hue. Unfortunately various wars and fires have taken their toll on what must have been a magnificent place originally. There are a few restored buildings and there are plans to restore more however much of the site is scrubby grass over ruined foundations.

That being said, it does make for an interesting visit and it is worth it. There are numerous documentary exhibits all around the cloisters which offer insights into the dynastic rule. Your level of enthusiasm for reading this sort of thing will probably determine the length of your time here. You can wander around for a couple of hours, taking in the buildings and the reconstruction video in a couple of hours. Longer if you like to read.

All in all, worth the VND and some of your time."
"Seems like a must visit location in Hue but really nothing fancy if you have been to Beijing's version. If you are in the area, I guess you will visit but is not worth to visit Hue for this."
"if you've been to Beijing forbidden city, this pales in comparison. The entrance fee is 150,000 vnd per adult is not worth the visit as many of the buildings are still under reconstruction and repair. We completed the tour in about 1.5 hours. Weather is extremely hot and we Took 3 breaks to replenish our bodies with water during the tour."
"If you go to Hue you'll go to the citadel. Very impressive building(s), set on the banks of the river. A scene from Top Gear was filmed here, where Clarkson and co took time out from their bike ride to view some culture on the way from Saigon to Hanoi. (The archway with bullet holes on it). Ok so it was unbearably hot the day we were there, so with 2 children, ice cream and AC were more important, as a result most of the site went unvisited.
Take water with you and if you can take at least 2 hours to see it."
"I had had high hopes for the Imperial City - but came away a little disappointed. However, it still took up a good chunk of the day, and was interesting enough to stroll around. I found it annoying though how many people kept badgering and offering their motorbike services, or water, or food, or the cyclos. They just didn't take ""No Thank You!"" for an answer. So that wasn't very nice.

They do have a little documentary to watch, and lots of reading to do at the exhibits."
"This place is not on the same scale as the more famous one in Beijing China but it is still well worth the morning looking at it. There is not much shade so dress suitably, bring water & bring umbrella / hat. It's a big place so good shoes also."
"The imperial city is a must if visiting Hue and won't dissapoint. Tickets cost 150,00VND to get in and is worth the money if you like architecture and history, if you don't then it's still a lovely place to walk round. Try and avoid busy times of day as the coached swarm in and is hard to catch any good photos or experience the quiet aspect. Most of the buildings in the Palace in the centre have been bombed in annihilation but there is a lot of work going in to rebuilding these structures. It would interesting to visit again in 10 years to see the efforts of themes works."
Great place to visit. We came to Hue specifically to visit and were not disappointed. Beautiful architecture and interesting history in contained location.
"We went here in July and were not so much impressed. Maybe we had a wrong idea or maybe the destruction during the war were too severe. One or the other, I recommend to take a guide so he can fill in the gaps and explain on the layout and purpose, etc. We didn't have one and it is not easy to get a feel without one."
"The citadel is a very historic relic in Hue and well worth a visit but is quite poorly maintained.
Lots of the structures have plants growing out of cracks and on the roof areas.
Desperately in need of cleaning and refurbishing to preserve the structures.
Waterways are overgrown with algae and have rubbish floating in them.
Come on Vietnam - make an effort to preserve your historically important structures."
Very interesting place and i recommend to every one visiting hue. However there is still al lot under construction and the lack of a clear overview of all the different buildings is a little minus.
Worth a wonder round if you're interested in the history of Vietnam. Get lost easily though so would think about going in a group with a guide rather than by ourselves next time
"My boyfriend and I enjoyed our afternoon here despite being outside in the sweltering sun. The citadel is extremely large, but it was fun to ""get lost"" inside. There were water closets and little vendors selling cold beverages throughout the place. The cost was approximately $15 for the two of us. We did not hire a guide as we wanted to explore on our own."
"Had a morning visit to this old site and enjoyed the experience
It has a very imposing entrance with lots to see inside. It was quite a walk to see everything but well worth it - the brass urns were very impressive"
During our visit to Vietnam we visited the city in Hue. A really nice place to visit even in the extreme temperatures. Hue is a very nice city and there are many restaurants in the evening. Also you can take a bus to the beautiful beach.
"We elected to take a carriage ride due to the size of the Citadel and the heat. For around $US10 we trotted around the perimeter. It was delightful. We then spent the rest of our time browsing the breezeway corridors, rooms and buildings near the entrance. Quite an amazing place."
"We came to Huè mainly to see this place. On our first evening we've had a lovely walk around the forbidden city. Lotus flowers on the moats, the gates enlightened.
The next day we came to visit the actual palace. 150.000 Dong per person (about 6 euro or 7,60 dollar). That doesn't seem to much, but for what is inside it was not worth it to us. There are only a few buildings that are quite special. Most others are in a terrible condition or renovated to look tacky, like the Royal theatre. You're not getting a map (apart from the tiny one on the ticket) or a leaflet. I guess they want you to book one of the official guides and a little bus. For people who don't like that kind of stuff it is a bit difficult. There are some info signs, but nothing really inspiring. You can also watch a cheesy video. Instead there are dozens of souvenir shops, everywhere. You wanna look inside a building and all you find is terrible paintings, overpriced soft drinks and fridge magnets. The two gardens are pretty, although one was in a bad state.
What we really disliked was the poor horse, strapped onto the middle of a giant meadow. In 39 degrees heat, without any water. At least in kind of ""official places"" people could pretend in taking good care of animals. There were a few other horses on the premises, but at least they were allowed to stand in the shade."
"Fascinating example of Asian imperial life. This site deserves its UNESCO World Heritage Listing, despite the fact that many structures were destroyed during the Vietnam War. Get there as early as you can to beat the heat (take a cyclo to get there); hire a local guide and be prepared to spend at least 2 hours wandering the grounds and reading the available information."
We spent the entire day at the imperial city. It is a beautiful space with intricate details. It is massive and easy to get lost on the many different buildings and rooms. Also houses a lonely antique store.
"The imperial city looks great but thats about it, there's no real information of the place and surrounding buildings. Would of been nice to have more understanding of its history."
"This is a huge complex with a lot to see. The separate pavilions are well maintained and some are still being reconstructed for viewing. The main gate - Ngo Mon Gate is large and impressive, once inside stand the 4 Deities cannons, massive artillery representing the 4 seasons. A short walk into the complex stands the Thai Hoa Palace and the magnificent throne room with the beautifully lacquered columns. A little distance away is the Royal Theater ( which was still under renovation) but you can still see the opulence. Well worth a visit. A word of caution if you don't have a local tour guide then a guide book is needed."
The price for ticket may be a little bit expensive but i worth the price. This place is must see when you plan your trip
"Avoid the large tours, you don't need to do it. Hire a guide on inside for tour, they do have a time limit so you can stay in and wander once they are done... It does feel a little rushed.
A large part of the Citadel was destroyed by the French and a lot is needing love, but worth the visit.

Please note, management of Citadel, we would prefer you treat your horse with more love and tie them up with shade and water, the middle of a field in scouring 38 degree heat and 80% humidity is disgusting!"
"This must be Hue's key attraction. It's a major heritage for the country.

The buildings are quite impressive - don't for any moment compare them with sister palaces in China.

But the explanations and upkeep were lacking. Why was the palace razed to the ground? I could only guess. The plaque that showed where the palace stood was unkempt for years. It's sad to see what must be grand buildings in ruins when they were built less than 200 years ago."
"Tickets are 150000VND per adult which you can buy at the ticket booth outside the entrance. They are very strict about where you enter and exit. We saw a caucasian family wanting to leave through the entrance because the exit is really quite a distance away but they were stopped by the security guards.

The grounds are huge. Very early into your walk of the place, you will chance upon a big hall with a large tv screen at one of the corners showing a quick and clear history and orientation of the imperial city. I would suggest that you watch it. Very educational.

Best to give yourself about an hour to walk the grounds. Your ticket should include entrance to the Hue Royal Antiquities Museum but that building is some walk from the exit of the Imperial City which is quite a shame as they could have converted one of the big halls into the museum. Instead, they preferred to turn the big halls into shops selling souvenirs, paintings and even a photo studio for tourists who want to take pictures in period costumes."
"If you stay in or close to Hue you must of course visit the The Imperial Citadel since it is one af the main attractions in the area. You can easily spend some hours in the Citadel since it stretch over quiet a big area but try to go early in the morning before it gets to hot! I got a bit disappointed when we visited the Citadel. The buildings is nothing special and the area is overgrown whit weed and is not well kept at all. However, some of the buildings in the Citadel has just been renovated and they give you a better feeling of how the place must have looked in its golden days. There is ongoing restorations so future visitors may get a better experience.
Bring a guidebook that can give you some informations about what the different buildings have been used to. At least that makes the visit a bit more interesting."
"We wandered around with an English-speaking guide who told us many fascinating facts. It was incredibly interesting; representing many facets of this amazing country's history. The restoration happening is wonderful, and you can see the parts that were damaged being rebuilt, as well as the original structures. A couple of hours very well-spent."
"The Citadel is kind of a must see if you're in Hue. It's certainly full of history, but most of the original structures have been destroyed and it's still in a process of being rebuilt. It's impressive, but not as nice as other ruins and temples I've seen around Vietnam."
This place is quite big so you need an hour or 2 to explore the city. You can either walk or use the electric car which you need to pay depending on how long you want to use it. We went there at 8:00 am so it wasn't that hot yet. Don't forget your umbrella and hat.
"Our guide told us this was the copy of the Forbidden City back in Beijng, well it is. It may be smaller and mostly destructed, but it's amazing place to see.
Even though some of the places are gone, some are being restored and it turned out beautiful. Amazed with all the history that follows.
Keep your camera on at all times to shoot the amazing landscape (except in the throne room)."
Incredible glimpse into the old years. Take the whole day but he there early as its super hot! Take water and hats. It's within walking distance of hotels but a taxi could be more comfortable
"The Imperial Citadel had a haunting, magical quality to it. Parts of it are fully restored and are a good representation of what it looked like 200 years ago, and other parts are falling apart and in ruins. The overall affect made a visitor feel like they were discovering and exploring areas that no one had seen in decades. Very fun and a great way to spend an afternoon in Hue."
"The Hue Imperial city is a massive scale attraction with lots of buildings built 200 years ago. It is definitely the best place to go to if you are in Hue. It reflects the history of Hue,Vietnam and it shows the history of Monarchy in Vietnam. I was really interested in learning about each and every king. I also loved the architecture of the buildings from Vietnamese Style to French style. This is a must go to site in Hue if you are travelling here."
"I visited the sight with my girlfriend in july 2016 and we were suprised both by the beauty of the ancient buildings and by the low number of tourists that we encountered during our visit. During the day it was relatively cloudy and thus only 30C so that the visit was very relaxed and we spent several hours walking around and enjoying the scene. It is possible to do several activities on sight, e.g. horse riding which could be interesting for animal lovers and families. For all others the buildings theirself are already wirth a visit."
"Everyone had raved about Hue and the Imperial City so I put it on my list. In hindsight I could have done without it.

The Citadel is impressive but like a lot of attractions in Vietnam unless you have booked a tour it's difficult to navigate your way around it as nothing is really sign posted.....

It's worth a look but don't spend more than 2 hours here unless you are prepared to fork out for a guide. For history lovers get a guide and make the most of it!"
Well worth visiting - the buildings were beautiful but it was great as there was a lot of information and history to give the citadel context
"I can't stress enough how worthwhile it is to visit this site when in Hue. The grounds are vast and there are plenty of areas and buildings to explore, plenty of history to imagine, lots of gardens to relax in and just enjoy your surroundings. There are tea houses and shops to buy water to keep you hydrated, and covered walkways to help you keep cool as you wander the vast grounds.

Do not miss this. I would budget half a day."
"This ""attraction"" is a must. It was so interesting to learn about the emperors of Vietnam, their years of rule, what type of ruler they were, number of wives, of children, etc. we were lucky enough to travel around the citadel by buggy - way too big to walk around. We saw the forbidden city, the wives' compound, etc. for history buffs, this is a must!"
"This a must when you are in Vietnam and in Hue,to see the history of that place.Our driver left us quite far,so we had to walk a lot.Also inside the territory is big.You need to pay the ticket of course.The palace is large.There was a screen with video and information about the citadel,to see before you go around.Need water with you,its hot.
Beautiful gardens.After, when you get out another gate,it is a long walk back again.Worth to visit."
"Per the guide books, Citadel was built up but there was a lot of work going on and minimal to see or do there. Would personally recommend a tour of the tombs just out of town instead of this"
"The Hue Citadel is a must go for anyone interested in the royal history of Vietnam. Compared to most places i have visited in Vietnam, there is abundant information about the city and other interesting topics available in English throughout the visit.

That being said, the citadel lost most of its buildings during the Vietnam War. The ones still standing are beautiful, but the citadel as a whole consists mostly of the green fields that have replaced the destroyed buildings."
"Although the poor old Citadel compound was devastated by war, there has been a lot of impressive restoration work undertaken and it is showing some of its former glory. It's easy to spend half a day or more (if you can tolerate the heat) wandering around here, there is plenty to see. The Co Ha Gardens in the northwest corner is a particularly pleasant spot to spend some time - very peaceful, beautiful gardens and you can enjoy a cold drink at the cafe there. Unfortunate that you can't take photos inside some of the more impressive buildings, but there are lots of other photo opportunities for keen photographers. This is obviously one of the 'must do' activities if you're visiting Hue."
"This is a huge fortress and palace that was the old imperial capital of Vietnam built in the early 1800's . It has many buildings, surrounded by walls and moats, and you really need an excellent guide like we had to take you through the complex. I don't think would have learned nearly as much without her by just using a guidebook. This complex became a major battleground during the Tet Offensive in the Vietnam war and there are photos of U.S. troops fighting in a number of the buildings that were reduced to rubble. They have done an excellent job of restoring some of the buildings and appear to be working on others. It was raining the day we were there but with an umbrella or raincoat for the outside part it was no problem."
Take water and go in morning before it gets too hot. You will need 2 - 3 hours there. Plenty to see. Don't miss the Japanese gardens.
"I've never seen anything like the imperial city before and it was amazing. I couldn't recommend it enough! Get the tour guide for 150,000 dong; it was worth it to find out the history behind everything as the story boards are few and far between!"
This is a very interesting historical site providing a wealth of information about the lives of the Vietnamese dynasties. Gives great insight into their ways of living and life styles.
"You could easily spend a day here if you like the history of these places, which we do and therefore disappointed by the short time that we were aloud here. Yes we were on a city tour. Next time we will go with out a guide as all that was said by him was available on signs and notices."
Had private guide the whole of the imperial city area very interesting and the history was nicw to hear about
This grounds of the Citadel is really quite huge and I would recommend to visit with a guide as to be able to enjoy the history better and in an easier manner
"This place is wonderful.

It a good idea to either read a lot on the subject before or hire a guide to help you tour the citadel. My guide gave me a lot of details about the reasons of certain building etc... however she totally ommitted the left side of the citadel.

I think overall you have to come prepare to do the visit. Lots of board to read from and learn from inside the citadel. The history is rich and interesting."
This site is very large and will require a large amount of walking. It is a nice place to visit if you enjoy history. This is one of the most important attractions in Hue- possibly the most important site in the city.
"This is very likely, imho, the best place to visit in Vietnam if you're something of a history and architecture buff. There is so much to see and admire, you can easily walk the grounds of the imperial city for half a day, take a relaxing boat trip on the Perfume river, and return the next day for more of the same. Despite war (and typhoon) damage, much of the western part of the city is relatively intact, some of it has been nicely restored, but even the more devastated and overgrown eastern sections are very atmospheric. To heighten the experience, cone early in the morning or late in the afternoon. Also, do prepare and read up on the lay out and functions of the many buildings of the city, to avoid letting it all turn into a touristy blur. When done with the city, don't forget another Hue must-see: the imperial tombs..."
The site is very big and I went at the end of May and the heat was too uncomfortable to walk around I sadly lost interest after an hour as many of us were on the verge of fainting as there is not much shade!
Walk across the bridge and check out the Imperial palace. No need for a tour guide. Family of 4 cost us 150k per adult and 30k for kids. There is plenty of English signs to read about the history of the palace. You can easily spend a few hours there but it is hot in June so take water and a hat.
"The citadel is big and beautiful, full stop. A bit silly to complain about the heat - you're in Asia in literally the hottest part of the year, you either didn't do your research or you're complaining for fun. No, there aren't many places for AC or fans but that's because it's a historically
significant UNESCO site still under repair ... Priority is not AC.
It's a cool place to wander around, and there are plenty of places selling cold water. Go early in the day and yes, be prepared to take it slowly. We went yesterday in the hottest part of the day (which was silly) and basically just allowed ourselves a lot of time to slowly wander and sit and seek shade.
Also disappointed to see people complain about 150,000 entrance. This is a few dollars. Be real."
"This World Cultural Heritage City is a defiitly a must, which still has partly been saved from the times of Vietnam war. It still is going through restoration and preservation stages, andparts are left ruined. The Imperial City with the Forbidden Purple City is a gem
The area of the whole City is huge by itself and one needs a good walking shoes if wanting to see all of it."
"Visiting here really helped us learn about the history of Vietnam, we were unguided so we may have missed a bit of information.. Visited on a ridiculously hot day, but there were enough water stops for us .."
visited the citadel in hanoi and disappoint. here is more things to walk and look around. it takes about 2-3 hrs to finish to discover all this citadel. you will see true ancient vietnamese architects from this place.
Maybe it's not so advisable to visit during June as the weather is just brutal. It's a nice historic site to visit but simply too hot and far to walk in between the palaces. Maybe the electric shuttles can be offered as a free transportation service within the park instead?
It's a beautiful place to go. A bit expensive to get into the grounds at 150k vdn but you can easily spend 3 hours exploring the place. Many of the buildings have been restored since the war but there is still evidence of the destruction wrought there. Be mindful of the heat though. Hue in June is incredibly hot and there are minimal places to escape it once you are on the property. More fans or places with AC would have been appreciated. It's an easy walk from the backpackers area.
"You'll want to give yourself at least a half day to see this place but even that likely won't give you enough time to see everything. When you buy tickets, you choose how much time you'll want to rent a driver & golf cart to take you from one section to the other. The architecture is beautiful & knowing the history behind each area is key to fully appreciating what each section has to offer. (We bought a Vietnam travel book online). There was even a small band of musicians in full costume playing music in one of the main courtyards. As is commonplace throughout the country, the restrooms are clean but don't have toilet paper & you don't have to pay to use it. We made a point to always have a roll of paper with us & I'd suggest you do the same. There are vendors along the way selling ice cream & drinks to cool off but that's mainly around the front entrance & before you get on the golf cart, if memory serves me right. A must see if you are in the area. Just give yourself plenty of time to explore. You can always buy more time if you run out."
For those who likes museums and history this is a perfect place to see. I'm more of a nature person so I'm not really invested.
"A very interesting place. Well worth having a guide. We went by cyclo from our hotel. Booked the tour online and paid a reasonable fee which included entry, however at the end we were required to tip as well which is a hidden cost. Overall though a good couple of hours. Go early and big hat or umbrella for sun."
The Citadel is a real journey back in time. This is simply a sight one cannot miss when visiting Hue.
"extremely interesting site, but gets very hot. so bring an umbrella, especially when travelling with kids. watch the different movies, they help you imagine the bombed buildings. dont rush, take your time to dive in and enjoy all sections. the garden at the queens mothers section is very peaceful and nice."
We visited this attraction as part of a full day tour of Hue. The buildings are all well restored and the exhibitions and photoes are well done. Although a lot of the architecture was destroyed in the wars with French and later the Americans. Great restoration work has restored it to reflect its beauty. Recommended for a visit.
"There are a lot of reviews that compare this site to the Forbidden City in Beijing, and that would be correct to the extent that the site really is little more than a sprawling complex of old structures. What we enjoyed the most about the site was the photographs of the nobles and their retainers and the brief histories provided with the photographs. Go early in the day in the hot part of the year (and what part of the year isn't hot in Vietnam?) We went to Hue in April and it was quite hot."
150 000 to get in. Average experience. I would say it was nice to get an idea of the history of vietnam in the dynasty time. Good education. The video that played was informative. Very hot and big space to walk around. Could do with an audio guide.
Went to have a look and surprised by the amount of information on display as well as exhibits. My only regret was listening to guide who set time limit as other areas to visit on the same day. I could have easily spent most of the day here but I suppose that's because of my interest in the subject. Lots of tourists. Be sure to take a hat because it was very hot but drinks available inside.
After two SHORT weeks in Vietnam in 2012 we drew up a bucket list for our return and top of that was the Citadel in Hue. The restoration of this magnificent place is progressing well and we were able to see so much more this time. Hue has so much to see but this definitelty has to be No. 1 on your list. I will say that having a guide as good as ours really adds to the quality of the outcome.
"It is really impressive to witness the imperial city ! I feel like I have gone back in time :)

The daytime heat made me feel uncomfortable but the palace was still a great piece of architecture :)

The entrance ticket costs 150 000 Dong. It also allows u to visit the Royal Antiques Musuem, which is located about 100m from the palace."
"Constant restoration going on here, in 20 years will be outstanding, but there is still enough here now to get an accurate picture of life under the old royal rule. Much better than the citadel in Ha Noi that was turned into French barracks.

Admission 150,000 vnd each & another 150k if you want a guide. We did not get a guide & found the excelent story boards in English & French sufficient to explain the complex.The guides seemed to rush people through, we spent 6 hours here & saw the whole complex.

The museum across the street (included in the ticket price) was disappointing with little historical detail provided on the exhibits."
"Its an interesting place to visit, but I would recommend a guide to make the most of the experience. It was a hot summers day, which made extensive walking challenging."
"It's too bad not many buildings remain standing, but what is left makes for a wonderful sight: the red color of the buildings - a symbol of luck and prosperity, the dragon shaped carvings and the colorful rooftops...simply beautiful."
"The City is currently being restored but enough has been done that you can picture the splendour of the Nguyuen emperors. Like the Royal Tombs, signs are translated into English which is so helpful and not common in Vietnam unfortunately. They were very informative and described in detail the buildings, their uses, and the furnishings. Allow 2 - 3 hours."
"The citadel was very informative and I had an amazing time. They only thing that was upsetting was seeing that a lot of the buildings had been destroyed by war (and natural disaster, but mostly war). Such beautiful buildings!! I love the old traditional architecture of the orient! So beautiful and detailed and filled with care. Most expensive ""museum"" we've visited in Vietnam (most places cost 30,000... The forbidden city to see the lot cost 150,000)"
"Hue Imperial City is a highlight of Vietnam tour. It is really worth visiting. If you are in a hurry, you can visit it in two hours or less, but I recommend you to take more time to enjoy the site. The influence of Chinese culture is visible everywhere."
"It is not as grand as the Forbidden City in Beijing, China, but still, it is worth a visit. You may need 2-3 hours to take a close look to everything inside the Citadel."
"A group of us spent approx 3 hours walking around the Imperial city and were amazed at what we saw. A lot of beautiful architecture and history can be found here. It was extremely hot when we visited, and would recommend bringing an umbrella or something to shade yourself throughout the tour if you go on a hot day as some areas don't have a ton of shade.."
"Went with our 2 twenty somethings but that option not available when describing type of visit (note for trip advisor). We went late afternoon and we're lucky in that not too hot so enabled us to spend a pleasant 2 hours wandering through the many buildings and gardens. You can buy a 48 hour ticket if you want to spread it over longer but personally pull think that excessive.
Interesting insight into the long time ruling dynasty of Vietnam. We chose not to have a guide and did not feel we missed out as there were plenty of signs explaining what we were looking at in English.
Only regret is that the numerous water lilies were not fully out as I imagine they would make a fantastic display."
"If you can do with a bit of exercise...take a walk. You dont need to follow a tour bus or a private car tour.

We walked. All the way from our hotel at Sunny A Hotel (lovely place..great hosts...but that would be in another review).

Walk to the Perfume River side to enjoy the scenery. Cross the river on the Truong Tien bridge. Enjoy the walk and the experience.

Once in the Hue Imperial City (150000 VND per pax)...just take a leisure walk around . Lovely architecture...gardens. Enjoy a drink at the Queen Mother's pavillion. Prefer not to take the buggy as you would miss out many interesting sights inside the buildings.

Bring the camera. And lots of water to drink...especially if the temperature reaches 39C."
"Impressive setting, guide and place. Can take some amazing photos. Really feel the history here. Camera ready."
"We spent half a day or so here. It was really interesting to learn about the emperors and their lives. Sad that a lot of the buildings were flattened in the Vietnam War. They are doing a lot of restorative work to the place, and it was a worthwhile visit."
"The highlight of Hue city! We spent half a day to went thru this attraction throughly. The long corridor after the supreme harmony palace turns out to be our favourite spot within the imperial city. The Ngo Mon is open to public anytime. You can freely take photograph in front of it anytime.

The imperial city is not as gigantic as the one in Beijing. One full day should be more than enough even you want to explore throughly and slowly."
Really interesting place to visit! You can easily spend at least half a day. It was much larger than we were expecting and with the heat (37 degrees) it was quite exhausting! Didn't see any maps there which made navigating difficult - we just had a photo on our phone snapped from the lonely planet book. I would consider getting a guide or some more written info if I was to go again. We thought there were some restauranty type things inside but we couldn't find them. Overall it is a beautiful site and a definite must see - definitely he highlight of Hue.
"Well Citadel, was fine.
One can see, lot of culture in the City tour of Hue.
The bad thing was that, it is Summer in June in Hue. The temperature and moisture were very high. So all of my energy was finished and I was exhausted during the half tour only.
So better avoid the summers (June, July), to Visit hue."
"A vast site with so much to see. We visited on an extremely hot day and definitely felt the lack of shelter as we moved between buildings and in places were there were no longer buildings. An umbrella for shade could be a good thing to take. Upside of that was that the place was practically deserted!

The complex varies and includes buildings with displays set up and some with video recordings. There are some really informative photography displays. In some buildings photography is not allowed, and in others shoes must be removed. In some you will get whacked by staff and roughly told to get out of the way if you stand between them and a fan or aircon unit!

Many of the buildings have not survived but it is great that those that have and that need restoration are getting the attention they need.

We spent quite some time here and the only problem we ran into was not being able to find the places that sold food. But we did find stalls selling drinks and ice creams. Would certainly be useful to take a map of the complex with you, or even hire a guide to get the most out of the visit.

A must visit attraction in Hue."
"It's really nice. Take your time to visit, as it is big.

It was a pitty that there were workings in some buildings, so you can't visit it all. And they never tell you when you buy the ticket.

A friend told us that it is better to visit on Spring, but we could not, so we went in January, and it was a delightful visit anyway."
Lovely place to walk through. You get a real sense of historical life in the Imperial city. Worth the visit. The golden dragon at the back was particularly impressive!
Enjoyed the tour around the palace except that i went on a blazing hot day. The written explanations of each part of the palace helped me to appreciate its history better.
"What an amazing place...make sure you enter by the foreigner entrance or you will be told off lol..absolutely beautiful place with great buildings, pools full of enormous Koi Carp and stunning gardens. There are very informative presentations and a replica of the improvements being made. There were a few school parties there and the kids wanted to practice their English which was sweet. Must see in Hue.."
A lot to see inside and outside. Very impressive to look at and with the history attached. It can be hot though with not to many places for cover. There are areas to buy drinks inside and out.
"Lots of history, lots of small museums to visit each with their own story. Take time to walk around the citadel which is surprisingly big inside. We ended up doing a tour of the complex with a group and combining it with three other tombs in the area which were stunning too. Thoroughly worth it."
Too bad a lot of it is destroyed because of the wars but still totally worth the trip to hue. Make sure to buy the combination ticket with the tombs as well if you have the time to visit those
"I'm not a fan of the Forbidden City in Beijing, and this is a smaller version of that same place, very similar. But, it's simply lovely if you like to feel you're really getting up close and personal to the sites. It is being restored nicely and there are still some ruins of the original buildings as well. A bit more detail in the English translations would be nice but apart from that an absolute highlight in Hue."
"Be prepared to spend hours there, plenty too see. There is also a bus service for those who have walking difficulties for a resonable price"
In a hot day is good to visit the royal palace where you can spent some time inside the exhibition houses reading informations about the emperor. Unfortunately have been many houses destroyed during the war.
"Definitely make the trip if in Vietnam, you can cover the ground in three to four hours for the citadel but try and get on the river as well, I'd suggest dawn or dusk as it's cooler and you stand a really good chance of spectacular sunrise and senset views. Spend time researching the history, especially the battle of Hue you'll get much more from the visit, YouTube and Wikipedia both cover very well. When booking hotels try to always look for the best views, be persistent it will make a big difference to have river views at altitude, and rooftop bars in the hotel."
Very interesting place and happy we saw it. It was a bit rainy so we were able to walk around and not be too hot. This place is pretty big so there is a lot to see.
"This is bit by bit being renovated after being devastated during the war between Vietnam and France/America. However, it is an interesting place to stroll around with lots of places you can stop for a rest. Many different sights to see and try to climb up on one of the ramparts to see where the local people lived and live."
"If you have a short time in Hue, you should go to the Citadel. Although most of it are in ruins and they are gradually restoring it, the place is still full of history. We went with a private tour and we got to know a great deal of history behind the places. We spent about 2 hours in the place. I guess if you have time, you can spend even more time there. However, it was scorching hot when we visit so it kinda deter us from walking much. Not much signboards with background of the history but you can sit down at a few places which has english videos explaining the history. According to our guide, at the side of the Citadel, there are good food around the area too :)

We bought a combi ticket which costs 360k vnd. It allows you to go to the citadel and the royal tombs. As the citadel is accessible, I would say it is a must see in Hue. I saw at the ticket counter that they have english guide but I dont know how good they are in explaining as I did not engage their service since i went there with my own private tour guide."
"This is ancient palace of Nguyen Dysnasty back to 18th centory. With various architecture of Viet ancient people was reflected in here. As Steps in, you are really in a scene, live of 18th centory with the King. Queen. Prince ..."
"With bikes from our hotel we began our visit of the Citadel by driving around the exterior walls. The ornate entry gates and relaxed town life under the shade of the tree-lined streets was a lovely introduction to our visit.

Walking through this extensive palace incredible. I loved the ornate painted doorways open to greenery, ancient walls, and stunning architecture.

My only regret was not having a guide. There are written explanations everywhere but reading them all would take an entire day. I'm not sure if guides work there but if there are any, we did not see them. Granted, we arrived at the entry gates at around 5:30 so perhaps they had already finished for the day.

Two hours well spent in this lovely UNESCO World Heritage site."
"Walking around the Citadel is a bit like having a toned-down forbidden city/winter palace experience minus the tourist hordes. Of course it's not as impressive but you can definitely find hidden-away quiet corners here and overall it's a very atmospheric experience! Some parts have been well-restored, others are quite damaged and un-restored. Interesting to learn about the heritage-restoration process.

Would definitely recommend going early in the morning or after lunch when it's (hopefully) a bit cooler."
"Could have been great with better upkeep and maintenance.
We visited as it was one of the must-sees in Hue."
We just walked around the outside of the city gardens as on a tight budget but plenty to see with historical buildings and people flying kites around the outside of the city its a nice walk and free activity
Nice to visit. Specially the buildings on the left site seen from te entrance! We walked for about 2 hours in the citadel. Worth to spend time there.
"Lovely and quiet city. Foods are phenomenal. Love biking along Huong river. Citadel is not much to see. Other than that, everything is perfect."
"Loved exploring this remarkable palace. It was 150,000 VND per adult for entry. Guided tours were an extra cost. Be prepared for the heat if you travel in summer."
"It was big with many nice sites. If you do not wish to engage guide, just sit through the video presentation as you cool off from the hot sun. However lunch time sees less tourist, so choose your poison ;p
Many interesting places for photography too."
"Take the day, and the tour. I only spent 4 hours there and the last hour was rushed and I am sure that I missed a lot. Great buildings and the chance to see both ruins and restored bring plenty of water."
"it's obviously impressive and you're bound to go there but it needs cleaning up a bit, plus the guides seem really lacklustre"
"you need some time to go through this site. Once you get through the first layer, and get into the second layer, there are some nice buildings. Also, musicians are walking around dressed in traditional clothing. Even though it got heavily damaged during the war, there is still lots to see"
"We were blown away by just how big it is, but it was amazing to see all the little gardens, each one different and each wall with different art! We were shocked that it hasn't been there that long and is in quite a bad state of disrepair, but it seems like they are slowly doing it up to its original glory!"
"I usually love these kind of places but this seems more suited to being called ruins at this point, and rather dull ones. Still very nice to spend an hour or two just walking through the sites, getting some great pictures and learning a bit along the way. It is huge! We barely saw any tourists. Make no mistake though, foreigners do pay a higher price (this is not optional) but you do at least also get a ticket to the Museum nearby to see some intricate Royal artefacts. CORRECT COST WOULD BE 150,000 DONG for Citadel + Museum ticket which was not optional, had to be to get both.

Some parts were nice but generally only nice for a walk and appreciating the historic value."
"Great place to visit, lots of culture and plenty of very interesting things to see. Historical photos showing the palaces after the war and now after restoration. Allow at least 1.5_ 2hours"
"If you want to visit an old and ancient place in Hue, the Citadel is one of the places you should not miss. You also know more about Nguyen Dynasty - an important dynasty in Hue."
"Wow, you could spend hours here learning about the history of the area. We had a guide, so were taken through each area with his expert commentary. It gets very busy so I would be there as it opens."
"If you have ever been to the Forbidden City in Beijing, China, I would recommend you not to pay to get into this one in Hue, Vietnam. What you see inside the citadel will be very similar, that's why I only walked around in the peripheral area of the walled city. I really think it is already a great hangout for the afternoon. You still manage to see the external door without paying. A penny. The river water surrounding the Forbidden City is disgustingly dirty, sorry to say, thus I don't understand why locals can still fish there. One more important reminder, the cheapest sugar cane juice with lime is found near the Citadel: 10,000 VND for two cups! Sugar cane juice with lime is a must try in Vietnam!"
"Small price tag, but worth it. The grounds are a bit dilapidated, but the structure remains intact, and is quite a sight. Historical captions also provided in English."
"This place you mush try to visit before leaving central region of viet nam, booking a local tour from travel company, they will give the joinery to discovery many place and tell you the story behind."
"That's the place you have to see if you stay in Hue. There's lots to explore in the citadel, from buildings to garden and temples - very rich in history.

We arrived quite late - around 4:30pm - but they were closing at 6pm (in early June) so it was perfect to have a good overview. You can easily take more time to visit it though."
"If you don't have a lot of time, forget about the Tombs and go to the Ciudadele
It is under refurbishment and it will take a long time to finish, but Unesco was right when they declared it World heritage site. Truly amazing"
Good to see the restoration work is being done. A must in Hue. Not as far as the other monuments if you are lacking transport options.
"What a beautiful place. Just 150.000dong, we can visit two places: The Imperial City and Royal Boutique Museum.
We spent about 3,5 hours to go around the Citadel and 30mins for museum. Many things to see and discover the histories are interest in. We loved it. Highly recommend!"
I screwed up here. I didn't get a guide and walked round aimlessly not really understanding what I was seeing. The place is huge but. With decorated buildings but it needs some TLC. Most of the signs and information are in Vietnamese (I know I'm in Vietnam) but without a guide of copious signs in English the while thing meant nothing to me. Definitely get a guide!!!
"Spent just over an hour walking through the citadel in the June summer heat. Having just visited the tombs and pagodas around Hue, this didn't seem that interesting, especially given the heat and humidity (everything is outside). If you are not into history, this place is definitely worth a walk through if you are in Hue but you probably won't spend more than 90-120 minutes here so plan accordingly. It's definitely worth the entrance fee (around $6 at the time)."
"150000 dong entrance fee is slightly extortionate for what it is. Quite a lot of work being done to the place and actually quite a lot of litter around which is a shame really. All in all 3 stars, not bad, not great"
Impressive. Worth visiting but there is a lot of walking. There is shade everywhere and drink stalls. U can rent a buggy for 1 hour
"We were amazed at how big the citadel complex was. We only had 1 1/2h hours here, but could easily have spent half a day. 150VD entrance fee. Plenty of toilets and cold drink machines.
So many glorious buildings and avenues. Signs in English as well as Vietnamese."
"I feel in Hue there is just tombs after tombs, and temples after temples etc. By the time we got to the Citadel, we were templed out. Enjoyable, just much the same."
"Need to allow sufficient time to see and absorb
it all. It is very large with different sections and history."
"We spent a few hours here, and walked a fair way during that time. Amazing photographs, fabulous surroundings - there is a program of restoration going on, which will hopefully result in a complete replica of the former imperial fortress, but what is there is already worth seeing. Definitely recommended if you are in Hue - could easily spend half a day here, but you need your walking shoes on!"
This place looks old but it has a lot of historic value. It is a world heritage spot. The uniqueness of this spot compared to other historic places makes it a place to visit. The design with the moat around it is impressive.
Very interesting and beautiful place. We did this by ourself but would have been great to have a guide to understand everything the Citadel has to offer. We got totally lost exiting the Citadel to meet our bike guides as there are several exits.
"My Hubby and I loved it, there is so much to see and the history was so very interesting! We were so surprised at the size of the place! It is absolutely massive! Amazing!!!!"
"A very interesting place to visit if you are at all interested in the history of Hue. We could walk to it from our hotel, the traffic is of course crazy but they do miss you and there are a lot of things to see when you walk..."
"Probably one of the most remarkable area in Vietnam. Atmosphere, arquitecture, nature and certain sense of spirituality acting together and creating you a sense of pleasure tranquility"
It is massive complex. You need a good guide who tell you story along understand more about the complex. Price for ticket entry now is 150.000 (7.5 USD) to compare to Grand Palace in Bangkok then it is only less than haft or it is same price of Grand Palace in Phnompenh. It is beautiful worth of 1.5 hour visit
I use motorbike tour with rider at Hue and this Citadel was the last one I visited.The citadel was the biggest one of Hue Tomb.When you inside some area was destroy and nothing seeing.They just do a long walk way and have history of citadel at the wall.No more staff to advice you about the citadel and some people cannot speak English.This place have more exit and I did not know they way to exit no staff take care and when you exit of the door you cannot back to inside although that the same day and I have a ticket.
"My friends and I did a stop-over in Hue during our tour of Vietnam and stayed in Hue for a day. We were told to do the Imperial city as it is a ""must see"" , but for our tour, we were not very interested in more of a history lesson. I found the Imperial city to be extremely run down ( I realize there is a lot of history here), but as compared to over parts of the world, I think the landmark could use some renovation/ restoration to make it a better attraction. It is worth a look since it is cheap and was an important part of the Vietnam story."
The citadel is in a huge area covering many thousand square meters. Lots of nooks and crannies to explore and there is even an artists workshop with some lovely pieces.
"This walled fortress and imperial palace is full of surprises despite the ongoing restoration. Much of the intricate walkways, gates and gardens remind you of the Forbidden City in Beijing but on a less grandiose scale, and with unique Vietnamese flourishes. This UNESCO heritage site makes a lovely backdrop for photos."
"The Imperial City was an amazing experience for me. The architecture and historical significance of the site are incredible. The site can take quite awhile to explore, so be prepared. The food here wasn't the best, so I'd recommend going between meals. Also, the isn't much in the way of shade or breeze while you wonder the grounds, so be sure to have a hat, light clothes, sunscreen, and lots of water if its a warm day."
Our family of 5 visited the Citadel in May 2016. What a remarkable feat of architecture with so much history. Some of the grounds are being restored but there is a lot that is largely intact so you can appreciate the full scale of this attraction. Purchase the admission ticket that allows you to also visit the tombs and it will be a full day of activity. We also did a boat tour on the Perfume River and visited Thien Mu Pagoda but all of this felt somewhat rushed (we were only in Hue for 24 hours so we had to make the most of our time here). The walk around the grounds is very peaceful as it was not very busy and there are places to stop to pick up refreshments. I highly recommend this attraction.
Take a camera and take in the many views and ruins. Enjoy the theater if you can catch a performance. Look for bullet holes from Tet offensive battles.
"A very impressive site. The complex covers a very large area & is very interesting. We were there on a wet day so only spent a couple of hours there, on a dry day you could spend all day exploring."
It is worthwhile visiting as it has a lot of old artefacts and buildings. It's a great way to understand the history of the city and country.
"The Citadel must have been a fantastic sight in its prime. Walking around the ruins, it is sometimes a little hard to imagine how grand the place must have been. The evidence is there, though, that through the careful restoration taking place, the Citadel will once more be quite spectacular. For now, it is a very interesting place to wander. Try to soak up the history and the violence which took place here if you can."
It's a shame that a large percentage of the Citadel was destroyed in various wars but even what remained is very impressive. I wish the Vietnamese government realised that they are sitting on a pot of gold and do the place some justice by spending some money on it.
"Hue's Citadel is both a fortress and an imperial palace, and is a huge place to spend half a day wandering. A lot of the area is ruined thanks to several wars (notably the Vietnam/American War) and other disasters, but several buildings remain and others have been restored. As an archaeologist I am unsure about restoring buildings (they bring buildings to life but can neglect the history of a place after it was built), however the restorations here have been carefully done and are very interesting. Older walls are riddled with bullet holes, and other signs of damage can be seen everywhere. A particularly quirky feature is the tennis court installed by the last Vietnamese emperor, Bao Dai, in the early 20th century before his abdication. The gardens are lovely, and several building contain exhibits giving more detail on the history and culture of imperial Vietnam. The entry price for the imperial city (150,000VND each for foreigners) was a little steep and has increased greatly over the last year or so. However the Citadel is a fascinating slice of history, and no trip to Hue would be complete without a visit."
"Was great day, huge place to visit; gardens were amazing. Best get an informative Guide to take you around as this site is both expansive and chock full of interesting sights and facts/figures."
I loved being able to read about the time period and the way of life for those who were lived there. It was boiling hot when I walked around so bring water but it was beautiful gardens and scenery. Most of the structures were destroyed first by the French and then during the war but some are being restored and the buildings that are there are really cool.
A really interesting place. Sadly so much was destroyed by war but so good to see work ongoing to rebuild and restore. Very hot in the afternoon but plenty of opportunity to buy water /drinks. Definitely one of the must-do sights in Hue
"Citadel is a big place to explore. The sun can really be harsh at noon so best to plan the time to be there. There is a shop inside where one can dress up in Imperial costumes, there is also a scheduled performance of traditional music of Hue and there are so many spots to take photos."
"Hue Imperial Citadel is a historic sites recognized by UNESCO, the capital of the Nguyen Dynasty. With ancient architectures, beautiful, mausoleum, which home to almost certainly must visit to Hue. But i think there's too high admission prices 200k adults."
"Although much of the original Citadel was destroyed during the war, there are still a lot of authentic remnants, and much good quality reconstruction is also occurring. This is worth a visit."
"The Imperial City of Hue is truly imperial. On a rainy day you have to fight of the umbrella salesladies, but it's worth it. A very large complex with lots of interesting buildings and structures. True, a lot has been hit in the American, as they call it here, but enough is still to be admired. Certainly more than worth visiting."
"Principle. Reason to visit Hue I would think and well worth a long morning tour. Opens early and I'd recommend it because in this off season was getting very busy before lunchtime.
Tickets to go in at 150,000 and get a guide (buy a ticket, +150,000 for a guide as well and pick them up at the right of the entrance.)
Worth getting a guide to learn about the city and the Kings.
You can walk for miles inside and beware the heat."
Part original structure and part recreated (a result of war). Very interesting! We did have a tour guide which made it helpful.
"The complex is sprawling and the entrance fee isn't cheap - 150,000 VND a person. But it was well worth it.

We spent 3 hours here exploring on our own. So much history and beautiful architecture.

Water is not sold inside. So make sure to buy some before going in, you're going to need it!"
"The citadel was bigger than expected, so it was a good thing we had comfortable walking shoes on. We did not join a tour, so we spent several hours exploring the place. There were golf carts (extra cost) available to ferry people around the area as well.

There were two very informative videos shown: one in the back of the main hall, and the other in a building in the Queen Mother's section. The ticket included entrance to the Museum of Antiquities, which was certainly worth a visit."
"The price of ticket is 120.000 vnd, expensive. But i think you should buy ticket to go inside. Very big, very beautiful and old. You can walk around to visit imperial for 3 hours. I and my family are really tired when we go like that. It's better if we have a car or bicycle to ride. But it is not allow. And remember take a hat or coco hat, jacket, and the sun cream beacause the wheather is very hot."
"This is a fascinating city within a city. Be prepared to walk... a lot. Just when I thought I had seen all that this incredible site had to offer, I would discover another treasure. The royal reading rooms, a grand theatre, wings for mother and grandmother, bureaucrats and concubines. It is amazing. And with a quite a bit of reconstruction underway, it will continue to improve. So well laid out and plenty of black and white pictures with English captions to bring the history of this Royal city to life. Don't miss pictures of the last queen; surely one of the last centuries great beauties."
"Imperial City is very beautiful and historical place to explore, spend your time to walk around the citadel where you can see the old city"
Ancient and historical. Worth the visit. Colorful and rich in history.There's an entrance fee which is slightly high but it's worth the visit. Spend more time to learn and enjoy the ancient culture.
We reached there around 10 a.m. and the weather was very hot. We spent almost three hours in exploring the imperial city. Sadly many areas were destroyed during war time. Hope the organization will restore them soon.
"The town isn't busy with tourists at present but I would imagine in peak season the Imperial City would be very crowded. At this time of year we had no difficulty in walking around at our leisure and could easily read explanatory signs.

The film shows a lot of digital reconstructions of the area and there are numerous scale models to see. The buildings that are reconstructed are very beautiful and opulent.

We were there around 2 pm and it was very hot and hazy with limited shade except in buildings, so agree with the need to take plenty of water. Much of the area is still in very poor repair including the gardens but at least there's not much litter around inside the walls of the city. Outside is a different story with the moat clogged with detritus!"
The Imperial city is just on the other side of the Perfume river from our hotel. This's wonder trip for those who are interested in VN culture and history.
"Beautiful and historical Imperial City. Lovely and diverse architecture. Scenic. Top attraction in Hue for very good reason. Not too much information inside, so read about the history before you visit, it will make your visit more meaningful."
"This is probably the main tourist destination in Hue. I still wouldn't call it a must-see, but if you are a history buff, you might enjoy it."
I really enjoyed the Citadel. Go early to avoid the heat if possible. We went around 11am and it was so hot. The grounds are lovely to walk around in and you can get that photo you want with no one in view reasonably easily. We spent just under three hours here and we're happy that we had seen everything we wanted. The entrance ticket includes entry to the Antiquities museum too which is worth a quick look but we were only there about fifteen minutes.
"We arrived midday and so the heat was intense but we enjoyed walking around the grounds. There are many shaded areas. As other reviews have mentioned, many of the structures were bombed during the war but it's easy to imagine the opulence and beauty of the past. We didn't have a tour guide and didn't know much about the history but there are interesting and informative displays and a film. Great exhibit on daily life in the imperial city that detailed the bureaucratic levels of advisors and how they helped the emperor rule."
Was a little bit pricey for what it was but obviously they need to fund up keep somehow for what is a massive undertaking of a big city and a lot of repair work obviously needs doing. If you were a history nut yes you could spend a day there easily but for us it was just more for a look around to say we've been and for us was good for a look. We saw what we wanted to see easily in two hours.
Loved the place... Too bad the air was thick with smoke from all the rice fields burning!! Still-- it's def. worth the trip. I just wish they would explain more about the restoration process---we were all fascinated by the mosaics made if repurposed glass and broken pottery but there's no explanation about it.
"There doesn't seem to be too much to see en in the city. But i was very positively impressed by this place. The payed guy can be spared with a good written one, but still is cheap."
"It was a nice place to visit, although not much compare to Royal Palace in Thailand. A lot of place to stop inside and have refreshment since the heat will make you tired."
"Spent a morning here after a night bus from Hanoi. Really well kept and preserved temples, ruins and pavilions. Entry is 150,000 and it is well worth it. There is very little shade so make sure to bring loads of water and sun cream. The food in the cafes is over priced with small portions so bring your own snacks. Overall a very pleasant experience."
"Set out here one morning. Paid 150,000 for an entrance ticket and once inside had a stroll around. It was incredibly hot and so stopped several times at benches that were in shade to cool down. It was fascinating walking around but a lot of it has been restored. Think I would have preferred if it was left as ruins to have saw the damage and that had been done, but it's very impressive the work they have done. Enjoyed the small part with photographs. Highly recommend a visit but take lots of water and a hat."
"Bring lots of water! Tickets for foreigners are 150,000 VND, which when you compare to the locals price of 120,000 is quite reasonable. Main attraction in Hue, definitely worth a visit - would recommend about 2 -3hrs to make it worthwhile."
Wonderfully preserved temples and carriages from a bygone age. Very atmospheric and the real Vietnam.
The Citadel is easy to get to on foot from most places if you don't mind walking. If you're staying on the opposite side of the river the walk across the bridge is pleasant but you'll get asked a couple of times if you want a boat ride. I didn't bother with that so don't know if it's any good. The Citadel itself is huge and costs VND150000 to get in (adults). There is a chance to feed the koi carp in the river if you want just after you walk in. Then there's a map showing various routes and what the buildings are. We just decided to make our own way round which was fine. The buildings and structures are beautiful and there's a lot of history there which you can read about from various posters and plaques etc. What I would say though is that it is very hot and humid so take plenty of water and sun screen. There are benches dotted about to sit in the shade though. We walked round for a couple of hours and covered about half. We found this to be enough.
"Many buildings that has been rebuilt after the war and natural disasters. It's a nice place to walk around and read a bit about the place and look at some pictures.

Entrance fee 250k"
"Very historic part of the town, our Vietnam tour guide took us through the grounds explaining much of the history.

Unfortunately so much of it has been ruined, maybe it will be rebuilt one day to look close to the original buildings.

Very large site so give yourself plenty of time to explore."
"We got here less than two hours before closing so we knew that we will have to rush. There was Hue festival on and different nationalities were performing in different parts of Imperial City.
We managed to find quiet part after visiting all the main buildings, which was to the left once you go through the main gate, after they check your tickets. There is beautiful pond with small 'coffee shop'."
"This is a UNESCO world heritage site. Accordingly, should be top of the list of items being restored in Vietnam. To be fair the authorities are trying to do quite a lot and there is a heck of a lot to do- almost overwhelming in what they need to do.

The one thing though that Vietnam does have in abundance is workmen and I would have though more attention would be given to keeping the grass mowed and all verges trimmed. It is a small thing but it does make one think that it is not top of the agenda.

Some very interesting historical information given and very interesting to see information about the royal family as this is the only place in Vietnam where remnants of the imperial regime still exist.

Well worth going if you are in Hue"
i was there with family ...4 adults. We were so unsure with main entry after we entered the citadel wall. So first man we met shown us the way with limited English. We were about there just around the corner then the tricycle man came told us that's not the way it's very far away. ..we bring you around the old city. We refused. Then he told he can bring us into the Citadel 1 hour around. He called his friend to come. Considering my mom we took the trip where 2 of us were squeezed into a tricycle. So they bring us the other way round the citadel into some Royal family residence which got nothing much to see lastly to the Citadel and told us to come out left side exit later they wait us there. We thought there were other visiting place in Citadel which is distance away. ..after we met them they bring us to Dong ba market. They will bring you all around the area and tell you story....i think we spent time mostly around and round the street. ...after reached DONG BA I'm not interested to see inside so i told them end here we are going to Thien mu pagoda.they dont want to let us go. they try to tell you to take the boat etc.i read about the bad comment to visit via boat. so i refused...also for the reason they want 300k per person...then they offer to bring me there. ...i know it's quite a distance so i refused. at last they need to let us go. ....they charged 80k told 1 hour total trip around Citadel now it's 2 hour so it's 160k per person.4 person 640k!!!!If i din insist to turn them away i think they are going to delay the time some more.....i knew there is such thing with the bikers but i never expect with the tricycle as well. Beware of them.
The Nguyen dynasty was very interesting. I passed the whole day in the old city. There are many parts of the old city to visit. It is easy to take a rickshaw to the old city from anywhere in Hue.
Interesting place full of history. Shame so much lost by time and war. Can still see some original remains of structyrs. Allow good couple hours
"I made a mistake and did not get a guide, I should have, feel like i just walked aimlessly around some old stuff for 2 hours."
"We went to Hue to see the Imperial City and we were not disappointed. The grounds are very large with many elaborate temples, houses and gates as well as interesting ponds. You are impressed even before you get inside as you can see the huge Vietnamese flag flying out front from all over Hue as well as the citadel walls and big main gate as you approach. We spent a couple of hours exploring the grounds and going in and out of some of the buildings. There are informational videos playing in some of the buildings as well as placards in some areas. Bring lots of water if it's a hot day as you do a fair amount of walking to see the whole site. This is a must do if you are in Hue."
"World Heritage - Dai Noi (Imperial Palace)
Walled in square with 600 meter long and 5 meter tall, the palace has 4 gates which is similar to the Chinese style.
There are a total of 6 palaces, yet a few are completely destroyed due to natural disasters and wars.
Along with the palaces are temples and lovely ponds, and a tennis court built by the last king! Spend a couple of hours to appreciate the ancient beauty."
"We rode around the site on a motorbike. The one place we found (we think) to park and go inside the guy at the gate pointed to a parking area with 1-2 bikes then went back to reading his newspaper. Meanwhile tons of locals just went through his gate. We figured they were employees but who knows.

The second gate we went through has no signs or other information about where to go and we didn't want to wonder around and leave the bikes there. So we got back on and rode around inside the outer walls and checked out the architecture and general layout before proceeding out to see some of the tombs and other historical sites which were more accessible."
"Well worth a walk around this old city. It's amazing to think that 40,000 people lived inside this 10 kilometer walled fortress. It's a shame that the restoration in parts is taking so long, but I guess it's a lack of money. A great insight into how old Vietnam ruled and lived. To get the most out of it, definitely have a guide."
Vietnam and Hue government are really doing their best to restore and preserve the imperial history of this majestic city. The beautiful houses and temples are womderfully restored. The city walls are impressive.
Really worth getting a guide here. Its a big place and worth a few hours. Also worth hiring a buggy to get around if its hot or wet. Beautifully preserved buildings snd history.
If you want to have a perspective on the history of Vietnam over the last 200 years and see the Imperial City that has been preserved the
The place give a good insight in the living off the royal family. Even many of the palaces got destroyed under the American war the place still have many interesting sights.
"I have gone to the Imperial Citadel in Hanoi and I can say that the Imperial City in Hue is really huge with more structures and history along with it. For me, it is better for one to get a tour guide to know more about the background of these structures. It was an interesting tour for us when we went there because the tour guide was able to tell the stories we needed to know. Again, the site is very interesting for those who like history. And since it is huge, there is a lot of walking for people who are not used to walking."
"Went to the citadel, as part of the city tour which included the total tombs and the pagoda. Great value, and gave a good overview of Vietnamese history before 1950. The use of water within the palaces was the most striking aspect for me."
Enjoyed my walk through the imperial city. Great spot for photos. Buses are not allowed through the city.
"Although I'd read all the guide books nothing quite prepared me for the sheer size of this site. It is simply enormous. Go early,take lots of water and good walking shoes. Entry was 150,000 D. Enter by main gate facing the river.Look out for the big cannons inside the outer walls. Guides are available as are trolley cars for getting around but best way is to walk and walk and walk.There are cold drink/snack stations and gift shops dotted around.If you have a good guide book you can self guide. Take a sun hat.
There is a cultural show in the Royal Theatre 1000 and 1500 200000 D They need at least 5 tickets sold before running the show.Normal exit is via eastern gate where taxis and cyclos wait."
"Visited the Citadel today, it was extremely hot so if you are going take plenty of water. The site is huge, so it takes a lot of walking to get around, very interesting, but be prepared for the heat."
"The palace is very big, decorated with ancient beautiful architecture. I was there a day before The Reunification Day, a national holiday in Vietnam. They prepared decoration for performance on stage and many women in colorful Ao Dai traditional clothes gathered in this place.
You have to spend more time in here because there are many corners you need to explore."
Spent a drizzly day at the Citadel and broke away from the group. Was able to cover the entire complex and had 2 coffee stops. Very enjoyable day!
"It was raining the day we visited The Citadel. The area is massive and impressive to say the least. It was busy with so many people. It was not well instructed, and we walked around the to wrong side and found we had to return completely to the other side for our tickets !! This was annoying, especially in the rain....perhaps some better signage would be helpful. It is worth seeing, to embrace the History and the size of the whole construction."
"Thoroughly enjoyed this amazing piece of Vietnamese history, architecture and cultural insight. I truly hope that it continues to be restored to its former glory."
You would definitely need a guide to take on Imperial City as it is rather big and requires a lot of historical explanation.
"Must see when visiting Hue! Make sure to see the southern gate, as it is the most impressive. We did the forbidden city part first and afterwards the outer circle. Nice little cafes available to have a rest and drink something."
"Perhaps because it was so hot we didn't get the most out of it, but found this a bit underwhelming. Quite interesting but most of the buildings were knick knack shops inside. Place could do with a spruce up."
"a great place, and not only from a historical point of view, but also just a great and beautiful, especially the gardens of the Imperial Palace)"
This old citadel is incredible. Well worth a visit of you are in Hue. Just 10 minutes away from our hostel. We found lots of information here and if you go I suggest going at 3 as less crowds and recommend a guide to talk through the dynasty
"This is an impressive complex you easily spend half a day here wandering around palaces, old corridor and royal temples."
The Imperial city was beautiful but there is so much to see and after awhile it all starts to look the same. I wouldn't spend more than one day here as there is so much more to see in Hue. The citadel is much larger than I assumed and will take at least one day to see all the main pagodas. Be warned.....we went in May and it was so hot! 115 degrees and lots of walking but worth seeing all the architecture.
"It is a nice walk around the citadel, where you can see the old city and walk to the palace which is a great sight. Walk around yourself if you can stand the heat, otherwise book a bike tour, which will drive you around for around 100.000vnd per person"
What a wonderful place - an absolute must see while in Hue. Hire a guide and spend the day wandering this magnificent place. The restoration of this citadel is amazing.
"What a lovely place, great service and friendly people. Well worth the visit while in Vietnam. The weather in May is a little hot but it's the low season so you can take photos without people"
"The only attraction you will have to do in the old town of Hué.
Even though it's beautiful, it should have been more impressive in the past but it's now all ruined by the two wars Vietnam has known in the XXth century. The price was 100 000D in 2015 but is now 150 000 which is way too much."
"wonderful architecture and artistic labour. Amazing to think how quickly it was built. Take a day to go round slowly (the heat means you need to take rests), take plenty of water as the
price of bottles inside the walls is ridiculously high. The grounds are enormous so make sure you have a good map and idea of what's there otherwise you'll miss things. Could do with a good dust everywhere but that doesn't detract from the wonders. Definitely don't miss it!"
This place í great but ruined a lot during the war. They are now under restoration and for sure will be much nicer after done. We really impressed with Vietnamese kings!
"The place is very large and spread out.Know which bits you are interested in otherwise you will get shown a lot of uninteresting bits and get overloaded with historical facts that don't register after a while
Its ok but no as good as Angkor or Grand place in Thailand"
"A historical place , walled fortress and palace , interesting architecture , huge complex , slightly in ruins though . lot of walking !"
Nice to see they are trying to do some more restoration here. Suggest you have someone who can explain the different areas to you.
"The Imperial City is a must see when visiting Vietnam, not only has it served as the Royal living palace for the past Vietnamese royalty. It also has a large significance during the Vietnam War, as one of the major battles.

However it is more than just a memory of the war, we were captured by the beauty and architecture of this place, as we walked around for hours exploring all the old buildings, and learning about the rich history of the Vietnamese people.

It is truly a significant place to visit, and I recommend staying for 2 hours or more to truly explore the city.

We walked to get there, and passed under one of the car tunnels in the surrounding wall, as it was safe to do so. You have to pay to get in so I recommend coming in the morning to get the most out of the experience."
This is a huge fortress representing an important part of Vietnamese culture. Very impressive stonework and simply massive.
"The complex is immense so bring your running shoes. Here's a hint. The exit is not next to the entrance. The custom is to have the exit to the side or the rear of the complex. Since the king was the only person to use the main entrance. Besides that cultural miscue, I had a great time. I recommend taking a cyclo back to your hotel. Remember that you must know how to negotiate, Vietnamese style, or it'll be an expensive trip."
"This place is the heart of Hue. When you understand about the history of NGUYEN Kings, you'll see this place is more beautiful. Hope they will recover destroyed parts."
This is my second visit to Hue's forbidden city and this time I found it a lot less appealing. So many of the buildings were not there the first time I visited and while I understand why they are re building it loses some of its appeal when all the buildings are replicas of what once was. The grounds are spectacular and the gardeners do some amazing work with the tree sculpting. You can easily spend 2 hours wandering around and seeing all there is to see. There are minimal English descriptions so hire a guide or bring a guide book so you know what you're looking at. I wouldn't miss visiting the Citadel but I wish they weren't so intent on making it all bright and shiny.
"This was the absolute highlight of Hue.

We went during the Hue festival (which I am told only happens every two years) so there were extra exhibits inside the palace.

The gates and architecture are stunning and the grounds are very impressive. Be prepared to spend a good amount of time here as there is a lot to see and it is HUGE.

The good news is that they have plenty of opportunities for snacks and even beer! It was a very hot day (~109F) when we went and there was very little shaded area. Luckily it started to rain lightly which was a welcome cool down.

There was an INCREDIBLE bonsai garden and tons of beautiful flowers.

Also note that there is a very small fee to enter. If you do not want to walk as much you can take a tour with buses inside that drive you from area to area but I would recommend walking if you're able.

There is no dress code, so if it's hot like it was for us, shorts and sandals are appropriate.

Don't miss this one!"
"The citadel was built up to be the main attraction in Hue and half a day should be allotted to it. However much of it had been destroyed and it in the process of being rebuilt. Some parts were interesting, but with a guide it took us 1.5 hours"
"Destroyed a lot but still great, especially when you have a knowledgeable guide to take you through site. Impressed with Kings of Vietnam."
"We were going to spend a half-day doing this on foot. Due to the heat, we hired to cyclo drivers. Not sure what you call these things in Vietnam: pedicabs? Rickshaws? In Thailand, we might say ""sam lor"", but the seats are in the front and not the back. We paid the 2 drivers 200,000 VDN total (I talked them down from 300,000.), but they convinced us to extend the tour a bit and take us back to the hotel so, we settled on 400,000. Definitely worth hiring the drivers. One was about 55 years old and spoke some passable English.
The only disappointment was that some sites or museums were closed on Mondays. The highpoint was the little history museum that had many artifacts from the imperial times, including china, crystal, coins, textiles, ceramics and other interesting things."
"I'm writing this review because I got the idea from other reviews that it's possible to leave the Imperial City without understanding what you'd seen, due to lack of interpretation. I'd say that has been fixed. There is now a lot of information about the history of the site and how the emperors lived there, including lots of photos. I also had the impression that it would be ruins, but there are actually still a lot of buildings to explore, and more being restored."
"The Citadel of Hue, is a large fortress built in the 17TH century (year 1805) mandated by Emperor Gia Long in the city of Hue in Central Vietnam. This huge and magnificent monument has been designed combining the concepts of Chinese geomancy (the best example is The forbidden city in Beijing). But its shame that half of the palace was bombed and destroyed during the Vietnam war. To save cost, you may purchase the 4-in-1 ticket in Imperial palace for only V360,000 (3 tombs & the palace)."
The Imperial City is a great piece of history being renovated as some of it was destroyed in the war. A vast complex that can take time to walk and a knowledgable guide a must. Take your time as there is much to see!
Had a great day walking around a place with so much history. Even enjoyed dodging the rain and lots of iconic photo opportunities.
"The Imperial City is of course a must in Hue. Renovations are ongoing, which means part is very fancy and shiny, and other parts consist of ruins. Make sure to bring a guide (human or book), because there are not loads of explanations in the individual buildings. The first part is very busy with tourists - when you move further inside the forbidden city, it gets a lot more pleasant. If you've been to Beijing's forbidden city, you'll see that there have been plenty of parallels between the Chinese and Vietnamese courts."
"This place has history going back centuries, you will get the best out of it with a tour guide. We visited on a very hot day and must say we struggled but glad we did it. The only damage really was by bombing in recent wars, typical!!"
Visited on a very hot day but was able to visit most of the complex as there are many buildings throughout the whole area. It was mostly destroyed during the Vietnam War and is undergoing major restoration but there is still a lot to see though the grounds are no longer as pristine as they were. It is still possible to see the many bullets holes throughout the complex as a reminder of the recent war. An enjoyable place to a peaceful couple of hours.
"150,000 Vietnamese dong per person. Relaxing walk around the temples and gardens of the Citadel, and one of the main attractions in Hue so a worthwhile visit. We stopped in one of the cafes for drinks to escape the heat. We found it easy to walk there and back from the DMZ bar in the old town over the bridge to the Citadel but taxi would be cheap and quick."
A very interesting place. Some reparations have been made but it is minimal. There is little money available for maintenance
We spent two hot hours investigating the Citadel with Hong. There's a decent early on video and a couple of the structures have been all around restored with magnificent signage. Tragically much is still in vestiges. Great lesson with tour guide.
"We found the Imperial City a fascinating stop in Hue. Our guide from Destination Asia was so informative on the many aspects of this city's construction and use. We were intregued by the art work, physical placement of the interior furnishings and the country's determination to maintain this historic site."
The gate as you enter in to the palace is quite grand and the moat is pretty cool. There is a good distance between each building or point with not the greatest walking paths in between. Sometimes it seemed like we were not really walking on paths at all. But as most of it was ruined by the bombing it's understandable that there wouldn't be any pathways left. They are starting to restore more buildings which will definitely help this place out in the future to give more of a feeling of what the time was like. Lot's of good reading about the royals in some of the buildings. You can even get dressed up as one and sit on a throne if you want.
"An incredible location within Hue full of history.
Although the citidel has gone through major reconstruction due to damage caused during the war it is still packed with history.
Due to the humidity if you feel it is to much to walk around the site or you want to see it from a different perspective
there are horse drawn carriages which will take you around the citidel for a small fee

This is a great place within the bustling city"
Buildings and size of the area was impressive. Reminded me of the Forbidden City in Beijing. Would be better if they had maintained the whole Imperial City and not just the main areas. But thats just nit picking and it is still definitly worth a look.
It was good to learn about the imperial history of Vietnam. Lots of photos and other items that bring the period alive. The fortifications and palace construction very typical of asian cultures of the period.
"It's a pity that much of the place was destroyed during the war. However, what is left is still gorgeous, the colours blew my mind!"
It was interesting to look at the ruins and there is a lot of pictures and writings which show the empire spanning back centuries.
"This attraction was on the more expensive side (entry was 150,000 dong), but it is definitely worthwhile. It was surprisingly well signed with lots of information in English. However, I would recommend using a guide or taking a book with you (which I did) for that extra little bit of information. We spent a little over 3 hours there and that was enough time to cover everything. Make sure you bring plenty of water because although they do have plenty of little shops/cafes, the prices are much higher than what you'd pay outside."
"This was a very interesting attraction to visit one that we really enjoyed, learning the history of the citadel from our tour guide was both informative and enjoyable. The buildings were unbelievable and the photo opportunities were excellent. The imposing Ngo Mon Gate is the main entrance to the imperial enclosure is something else. We visited in the afternoon which was quite hot so you need the usual protection, hat, sun screen, good footwear and plenty of water."
Really worth visiting....walk it if you are able (as opposed to small motorized carts) as you are able to soak up the atmosphere better. Explore all the buildings...very interesting.
Another ancient place destroyed by American Bombs. Such a shame. Would have loved to see in all its glory recreated video movie not enough. Don't go on hot humid day. Totally unbearable and not for faint hearted we could do it all due to heat exhaustion. Guide was excellent. Le tau restaurant magnificent but didn't like 3 hour trip to get there from DaNang. Too long a day
"Well worth visiting, but I was shocked to learn that it isn't as old as it appears.
Doesn't compare to the forbidden city in Beijing but still worth visiting - make sure you see the section around The Mieu"
"Top 10 sight. Vast citadel, takes a fair time to get around. Lots to explore and plenty of photo opportunities.Busy road runs through grounds so usual motorbike pollution. Well worth the visit"
Our tour group walked all around the Citidel while learning the long interesting history from our guide. We were in awe to see the buildings and to understand what a large community this was at one time. The restorations being done were amazing. I would recommend going here as long as you have some kind of guide who understands the history. We took one of the rickshaw rides from the Citidel out to the city markets - definitely recommend doing this!
"This could be great. There could be maps to help visitors, but there aren't. There could be information panels, but they're few and far between. There could be a sense of the life of the Imperial family, but it's been stripped out. Most of all they must immediately sack the restorers. The buildings the restoration team have touched are essentially vandalised; all sense of elegance and subtle has been painted over. The good news is that if you get away from the main buildings and go to the edges of the compound e.g. the 'dowager queen palaces' and the side gates you'll find - all-be-it slightly faded - the beauty that was originally there. And that is worth visiting."
"The forbidden city was huge. With the hot dry weather, I brought my small camera along this tour to visit the insight of the city. Beautifully maintained and with our guide, we tour this place with great interest and sight. Every photography I captured were beautiful when I review them back.

The place is colourful, serene and peaceful.

Strongly recommends visitor to visit this place when you are around Danang, travel down to Hue for this place. Worth the visit."
"Once you get past the cyclo drivers offering tours, the Citadel is an impressive sight. We were there on a rainy day and still enjoyed our 1/2 day. On a sunny day it would have been easy to spend more time.

We found the compounds on the western side - Hung Mieu, The Mieu and the Hien Lam Pavilion more interesting than the Forbidden Purple City at the centre of the Citadel.

The ornate Royal Theatre is definitely worth seeing. Some people miss it because the entrance is hidden at what seems to be the back."
"The visit of the Imperial palace leaves an impression of both timelessness and its period. Restauration work is in progress and a number of buildings have already been restored, but the remaining ruins also tell their stories, as do the photographic documents of the devastation during the wars. There are excellent explanations of the evolution of the palace and the Nguyễn dynasty, and their roles in the history of Vietnam, along with the day to day functioning of the palace and its relationship with the people. The size of the palace meant that it was very easy to be alone and undisturbed, to take in the whole redolent history of the site."
"You'd probably get much more out of it with a good guide (or with heavy duty background research), but I'm not sure if this place is worth visiting by yourself. There's not too much effort put in giving the visitors information about the palace area or its history, not even a decent map is provided. You get some idea how the place must have been like in its days of glory, but I didn't find the visit very educating nor impressive. I hope it will be different in the coming years but at the moment some of the historical sights in Vietnam seem to exist merely for selling tickets and services to tourists, not because the past or the cultural treasures were appreciated."
"The overall size of the Citadel is incredible, to see it properly would take a few days, our guide showed us the highlights which there are many. Get there early, wear a hat and take plenty of water as not much shade between sights."
Video in the forbidden purple city helps to bring former glory to life but still a lot of renovation needed to appreciate in person
"While this is like a small copy of the Forbidden City in Beijing, what made it sad were the gaps left as a result of bombing in the war with the United States. Great efforts have been made to restore the Citadel, but many more need to be made."
"Nice to walk around. Colorful, is still being restored in a lot of areas. Not a lot to see. The gates were nice, enjoyable to walk around, some beautiful bonsai."
"Hue citadel is a lovely historical place to visit. The grounds are huge and well worth a walk around. There are many signs to inform visitors about the his our of the place, which is helpful for those interested in how the palace functioned in the past. Beautiful greenary. I would not hesitate to recommend a visit here."
"The more interesting buildings are towards the front of the complex. Don't put yourself under pressure like we did to talk the whole thing like we did, as it 75% very similar. Two hours checking out the main buildings would suffice.

The city isn't as old as the name might imply, think I read about 200 years. I wouldn't say making the stop in Hue was worth it if you were basing your stop on this being a highlight of Vietnam.

Hue worth the stop to use as a base for DMZ tour though."
"The Imperial City, the Citadel, is a huge complex where there are a lot of ancient (restored) buildings, temples. Great to see the colourful buildings and the old gates and all. Only 'concern' I got from this: they fought heavenly in the Citadel during the war. They're busy restoring it now and did already do a good job so far. But is it restoring or just rebuilding.. The sight looks nice though, with all the colours back on the walls, but not sure whether it's 'real' or just redone. Great place to wander around for hours though!"
"I'll put it simply: if you are planning on going to Hue to see this, then bypass the city altogether. This site, like the res of the city, is just very unremarkable and uninspiring: semi-ruined gardens and buildings with golf cart-style buses zipping around. Museum at the end is ordinary. This is disappointing as the place has lots of potential to be really beautiful and fascinating if they invested some money. Maybe you can contribute to this by visiting now and supporting it; or maybe you can't be bothered, in which case, I don't blame you."
The Imperial City covers a vast area and contains many buildings which are very ornate and beautiful. There are also lovely gardens.
We arrived very early in the morning to avoid the crowds from bus tours that arrive throughout the day. It's a much better experience if you can do this too - uninterrupted photo opportunities and less loud tour guides shouting at their followers. It's very well preserved and they're going to a lot of effort to reconstruct and preserve what they have left. It's very beautiful too so make sure you spend half a day here having a good explore for yourself.
"Good day outing, some impressive structures, and a vast space to explore.
Do it early, the heat of the day is murder.
Pity that the majority of buildings were destroyed. Regardless, it was a good days walk."
"The ticket's price is quite high for what they offer. It would be reasonable if they improve more. You need to pay for the guide which means it costs more money. The map and guideline are not good enough to explore on our own, even for a Vietnamese like me.
The electric bus is even too much to pay. I didn't use it."
"The Citadel is large and ruined. Little of it is in its original condition due to natural weathering. The museum was the most impressive with all of the artefacts and pottery. There are very few signs around the Citadel telling you what was what and what was where, so we had to frequently consult our guidebook because we didn't travel there with a tour guide. It's lovely to see the moats and the Lakes and the gates are very ornate, especially those that have been renovated. It was interesting to see the Throne, Theatre and the Reading room which also had a small souvenir shop within it. I'd recommend a visit if you are in Hue."
"Flavour of forbidden city in smaller and less ""in shape"" but certainly to visit to understand the story of the local kingdom.Try to be there with a sunny weather it will be more glamourous. Spend your time in "" promenade""...but the best is around yhe city : the tomb"
A must see for any trip to Hue. Loads to see so allow plenty of time. The video of how it used to look was good.
"We spent a few hours in the Citadel. lots of walking around, lots of interesting buildings and artifacts, and a lot of restoration going on since the damage during the war. Well worth a visit, but give yourself enough time to see it - and there is a lot of walking.

There is a separate entrance for tourists. You have a choice of tickets, it is probably worth buying the combined tickets if you think you will visit other sites in Hue. We bought just the citadel and museum entry ticket."
"Far better than we imagined from reading the guidebooks. Less going on than the Forbidden City in Beijeng. But they are renovating and rebuilding bits all the time due to all the bombing in the US war. We enjoyed the architecture, colours and gardens.

Try and take a map with areas highlighted to visit, lonely planet has a good map and information, as there is a lack of info within the site.

We spent around three hours here and finished just as it was shutting. They closed the south gates, where we entered and had to backtrack to the east gate to get out."
Great just walk around for few hours with the guide book and read about the history and purpose of the buildings.
"I suggest a one day visit of the Citadel, maybe even less...It is better to have a guide (book or person)!"
"the entry fee is 150,000 VND and you can easily spend half day here learning all the history of Hue's kingdom.
love the video they show how the ruin was reconstructed.

overall it is a MUST VISIT place"
It was nice to see the site for a second time. Renovations are being made. Very encouraging for the future
"As individuals with a good interest in History we had reasonable hopes for this. However there isn't much well presented information. You'll need a guide to attain any understanding of this place (which conveniently you can pay extra for).

It's a shame because if managed correctly this site could be fantastic given its scale and history.

Do not go unless you are prepared to pay 150,000 VND for entry and another 150,000 VND for a guide - having been to the Hoa Lo prison in Hanoi the day before for 30,000 this price was even more outrageous."
After traveling around Japan last year and being overloaded with temples and palaces I have found it hard to be impressed since. However I really did like it. I would have been more impressed a year ago however it does have a Vietnamese twist and was much greener and there are a few really beautiful buildings. I didn't think that there is an aweful lot to do in Hue so spending an hour or two here wouldn't be wasted and is worth a visit.
"This was one of the expensive tours we opted for while in Hue. About 32 USD pp. But it was well worth it. Although, the scorching heat made it quite uncomfortable. But a very interesting place with so much history in it. Give yourself atleast and hour and a half or two to walk around and explore the place well. Carry water and all that you need. The stalls selling it nearby sell it expensive. Hire a guide or atleast get a map of the place. It is huge and very interesting if you dig into a bit of history attached to it."
For someone on a backpacker budget I felt it was a bit steep. The main entrance and hall is cool and wandering around is peaceful when it was quiet but (especially in the heat) it begins to be similar. Only 2 hours max really needed. But if your in Hue it's cool to see
"Love the adventure we had over in vietnam,wou,d like to go back and explore more one day, with hubby"
"We tried to avoid many of the typical tourist attractions, however this was something we needed to see.

A massive wall around the outside surrounds the Citadel, outlining the footprint.

We took our rented scooter and parked it right outside the exit of the Citadel; paid 10,000d to park.

The inside is massive. I would suggest getting a map of the inside or downloading the maps.me app which we used to trace our progress, and find our way around.

There is lots to take pictures of, lots of history and stories of ancient times to be absorbed.

It would have been nice to have a tour guide, which some people had, to have the proper story explained to us. We were fending for ourselves with our Roughguides book and piecing together what we could reading the signs.

The day that we went (late March 2016) was extremely hot. If you are going on a warm day, try to get it early morning, or late afternoon if possible. We went right at noon and had to cut the trip short as it was blisteringly warm. Bring your own water and food as well, everything inside is more expensive of course.

Budget an 1.5-2 hours here if you want to take your time and touch on everything. On a cooler day, and for history buffs, you could spend more."
Beautiful place but not to be recommended in the heat of mid-day. Was being used by students who had just graduated to have their photos taken and it seemed such a happy place.
Our hotel Serene Palace organised the tour. At USD40 pp it's not cheap but was worth it. Saved time and gave a great insight into the history of the Citadel and the Royal family.
"The citadel housed royalty in a range of purpose built areas. Enclosed gardens, lakes, moats, kitchens, libraries, areas for many concubines and a strong French influence can be seen given the link with France. The housing of carriages - both hand pulled or carried were of interest. In addition a whole pavilion is dedicated to documents which indicate Vietnam owns the islands that China is now building on illegally. The area is huge and the architecture, artwork and furnishings are in surprisingly good condition. Worth a visit - however go with a guide."
This was an amazing place to visit. So rich in history although we found a lot of history not mentioned here. The buildings that were there were stunning and it was quite nice to dose the ruins of where buildings had previously stood. Definitely a must if visiting Hue
"It was a very hot day when we visited. We were soaked in sweat and 10 of us saw a place to buy a drink under a covered area. We had also passed another place selling drinks and ice cream just a little earlier. They were charging 25,00 for Ice cream there. We walked up and the first man asked how much was the ice cream. The lady said 70,000. He said I wont pay 70,000 and walked over to sit down. I told her that another place said 25,000 and she said, ok give me 50,000. I bought one because I was hot. The others decided they didn't like the womans attitude and just went over to sit with me. The woman came over and turned off the one little fan on the ceiling. I said, please leave it on, I bought Ice cream. She ignored me and walked to sit with her friends that started laughing at us. We walked down to another exit and there was another same type of stand and the woman sold it to our guys for 25,000 . The other woman was very rude and trying to scam us. Its too bad someone in such a great place as the Citidale is so dishonest. We enjoyed seeing the Citidale very much."
10k place to walk the whole place. We didn't end up walking from end to end because weather was hot..pretty much empty place with a view photo or documentary about the palace back then.
"This is a work in progress for the Vietnamese. It was badly damaged in both wars/ and with money and time is being rebuilt. Took a couple of hours with a guide to see it all properly and worth it for the history of the monarchy (40usd for 6hr tour with car, boat and lunch, entrance coat separate.)"
"We spent two, very hot hours exploring the Citadel. There's a good introductory video and a few of the buildings have been well restored with excellent signage. Sadly much is still in ruins."
"It is would take a full day to explore this place properly, but with three young kids in tow and the humidity cranked up to 1000% we lasted about three hours. It was difficult getting here because most of the bridges were closed due to a cycling race through Hue so the usual 8 minute, 50k VND taxi ride took 25 minutes and 150k dong.
Entrance price was reasonable at 150k dong per adult and kids under 12 free ( so equivalent of $18 Aussie for the family ). We walked a bit then grabbed a large golf cart that fit 4 adults and 5 kids comfortably with a tour guide for 45 minutes, total cost 240k dong. She whisked us round to some key sites and let us get off to explore at leisure then dropped us back at one of the entrances where we grabbed a taxi back to the hotel to cool off in the pool."
"Hue's Imperial City was definitely a highlight to Hue for us.
That being said, there wasn't much to Hue.
But that's besides the point.
The imperial city is huge! It took us hours to check out fully.
If you spend the time looking at the finer details, there's beautiful hand painted designs on the majority of walls in the refurbished buildings. The grounds are wonderful to walk. Keep your eyes out for bullet holes in some of the older walls.
The architecture is wonderful as well.
We would recommend sitting through the provided video as it helped teach us some awesome facts about the city and palace. It will make the walk around much more enjoyable.
Altogether it's not mind blowing but Hue's Imperial City is a great way to kill a few hours if hanging around Hue. We would recommend a visit."
"as its a large site we took a tour with a qualified guide and felt it worthwhile as she gave us a very detailed tour , giving us information we wouldn't have found on our own. The tour took several hours but was worth it"
"The antiquities in Hue date from the early 19th century and the ones outside of the Citadel are very interesting.
The Citadel itself was destroyed to a large extent during the battle of Hue in 1968. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site now and some of the buildings have been rebuilt. But there are huge areas within the walls that remain as rubble or with grass grown over.
The Vietnamese government does not seem very interested in preserving its antiquities and many of the temples, mausoleums and pagodas are not in good repair.
Having said that, the whole city is a very interesting one day destination."
Spending the early morning hours in the Hue Imperial City was my favourite experience in Hue so far! I spend 2 hours of just strolling around between palaces and threw massive gardens. Seeing the remaining and rebuilt parts of the citadel makes possible to imagine the overwhelming dimension round about 200 years ago!
"The imperial city is ringed by a moat with a very tall wall over 2km surrounding the the whole Citadel.
Unfortunately a large number of buidings have been destroyed due to typhoons or the Vietnam War, but now are being restored.
Well worth a look , but bring your walking shoes it is a large place."
One of the obligatory places to visit in Vietnam. Unfortunately the day we visited it was very hot. 41 degrees.
"It was cool to visit. If you're in hue you should go here. It's big and there's a lot of history in there. But it wasn't anything special. 3,5 out of 5. Worth visiting."
Imposing building. Huge grounds. You will only be able to see/walk about half of it. Lots to take in. Restoration work being carried out. Very beautiful.
"We visited the citadel after lunch and it was so hot!
The history is interesting and try to get a guide whom can talk English clearly.
Very interesting information on the life back then.
You can walk inside or hire a bike or an electric car driven by one of their staff.
I believe a must do while in Hue."
Second time I have been here in 18 months. Amazed at the amount of effort being put into renovation of the place. Even though sections are being renovated I would highly recommend going. Highly recommend a guide to get a full perspective and understanding of the importance of this place in relationship to Vietnams history. We spent 3 hrs and saw most of the place. Look forward to returning at a latter date to see all the progress in renovations.
My friend and I recently visited the Citadel and found it quite dry and uninteresting. Unless you are interested in the Nguyen dynasty of Kings you will not find this place very interesting. It's not exactly that interesting of a place to photograph either. Way overpriced.
"I appreciate the historical aspects of each country we visit and Hue offered that opportunity. The imperial city is well worth the time and offered excellent comparisons with that in China. One cannot hold the Vietnamese accountable for the loss of their historical landmarks due to war and they are making excellent progress with their restoration efforts. We traveled in by moped and it's a bit of a challenge to find the entrance as there is a bit of a one way system in operation, but once conquered it is easy enough. Would be nice if they relaxed their rules on exiting the place as the additional two km walk out the side entrance to get back to your parked vehicle could so easily be avoided."
"The Hue Imperial City really is a must see when in Hue. We took a rickshaw ride from the city into The Imperial City for 200 000 dong. Encoder earned his money as it was a hot day and he had both my wife and I on board. The city gives a great insight into some of the history of Vietnam, including its emperors. Lots of walking to be done here. You can hire a ride around on a cart if you like. The old buildings are fantastic, but probably the most powerful part of the tour is seeing what has been destroyed by war. A real shame that the main parts were destroyed. Lots of these buildings are under renovation or construction."
This wonderful enclosure is gradually being restored to its former glory and is a fantastic glimpse of just what life was like behind the fortified walls for the Royal family. It's a beautiful place to wander around and you need a half day to fully appreciate it and explore all the buildings. There is a small cafe which serves cold drinks and a comfortable place to sit if you get tired.
"There really aren't words to describe the Imperial city. It's a must do item in Hue.

The whole place has that feel of presence about it. The workmanship and structures are truly amazing.

Well worth visiting. Best to get a taxi to the front gate and walk from there. If you exit via the right hand gate, there are many taxis and bikes available to take you back to your hotel.

Make sure you have a few hours to explore this beautiful place."
"We visited without a guide and it was so big that a guide would have been better. Had some idea from our guide book. Definitely need a good few hours to see it properly. The kids were a bit bored, but it was safe enough for them to sit and wait for us. Whilst they were sat waiting, they were constantly being asked for photos with locals as there were a lot of Vietnamese visiting the site due to its historical significance. This made the day more interesting as being Western tourists, we were a bit of a novelty!"
The most beautifull buildings in Vietnam. It is nice and quiet as well. Surprisingly not many tourists.
"To have 2 different entry prices 1 for locals and 1 for tourists to me is scandalous and leaves a sour taste when entering (for a meagre 30,000 VND why not make it the same). That aside the Imperial City, having been to the Forbidden City in Beijing, offered a lot more greenery and grandeur on a smaller scale. Along the same principles with Urns, Bells, Dragons and Pagoda's as symbols. There was amble information to digest and gather an understanding of the history and significance. It gave a really good understanding of the different reigns and dynasty that moulded Vietnam, and how each dynasty left its mark on the City. Various customer such as Betal chewing was also on display. We spent 3hrs walking around and got to the outer walls which was around 10kms. The exit was made very complex as you could not exit where you entered taking you mines away from where you want to be and confused as to where you are when you exit, why nobody knows."
"We booked a trip from Hoi an where we were staying. When we arrived we were supposed to have an English Speaking Guide. However this was not to be, and we had a Vietnamese speaking guide, who told our tour guide (who accompanied us in the car) and he translated it into English, but his English was much to be desired, so you can see our dilemma. I would of liked to of understood a lot more of the history, and have tried to look it up on line since our return, but there is not a lot to find out on the internet."
"If you have been to the forbidden city in Beijing you might be a little disappointed but it is worth a visit. Go there in the morning, take some drinks with you and make it past the rikshaw guys and you will find a peacefull place to look and mingle around. Because nobody wants to sell you something ;)"
"Would thoroughly recommend this to visit if your time in Hue is limited it is not to be missed.

We did a free walking tour with three wonderful Students who guided us through the old quarter to here. (I have reviewed this separately - and is a must too)!

We had half a day and could've have easily spent all day here.

Well maintained and fascinating."
"Very impressive complex, lots of places have been destroyed during the war and have now disappeared, which is sad, some places are slowly being restored, when funds allow.
Need at least an hour plus to wander the whole area allowed"
Living in VN we had heard many citizens emphasize the need to go to the Citadel. One must experience this to truly understand the rich history of the country and to put the VN war into perspective as many of the buildings were destroyed although very minor impact on the walls. Understandably why this is a UNESCO Heritage site. The restoration is amazing although there is much left to do. While one could tour by yourself I would highly recommend having a tour guide to explain what one sees and also have access to some of the limited areas.
"The Citadel wasn't as exciting, spectacular or glamorous as we had expected. The highlight was finding a tea garden off one of the paths to sit and chill. Worth a visit just to have the experience of its magnitude but lower your expectations on the rest and the interior."
"I thought to see some old palace, but it was only small things. Vert dissapointed. Better spend hue time at the beach"
I really enjoyed the trip there! It's really beautiful town! Must visit this place if you want to learn more about Vietnam
Give yourself some time to walk around this beautiful area.The restoration work is ongoing but the results are stunning . It can be accessed easily from most hotels in Hue.
"I have to admit that I did not like Hue itself but the Citadel was a real treat. I would recommend to get the most of your experience read up a little on the history before visiting.

Take lots of water, wear some good walking shoes and then just explore! There were beautiful buildings and some great photo opportunities. Some parts were a bit like exploring a secret garden. Take a spare 5,000 dong and you can buy some food to feed the fish either at the entrance or on the little central island. You get free entrance into the museum of antiquities which is just outside the main Citadel - its small but there some interesting pieces so worth a look.

Overall a really fantastic day out!"
"When we visited Hue it was very hot and humid. It is a considerable walk to the Citadel which is a large, spread out complex, part of which are under restoration. A very big Chinese influence in the design and layout."
"The citadel was great, but there is a scam running around it. We were using bikes to visit Hue, and when going to the citadel through the main gate a guard (that seemed to be an official one from the government) told us we could not go in with the bikes and had to park them. There were a few of them parked there, so we left them. After we park, the guy asks us 10k dong for each bike. At our hotel they told us we'd have to pay something, but not so much, so we told him 10k for both bikes and he agreed.
When we came back from the citadel, my bike had a flat tire. It was OK before, it really looked like it had been emptied. It became obvious later: after walking 200m with the bike in my hand, there were a couple of guys selling air tubes, and also some cyclo driver offering to take us to a shop where they would fix our tire.
We refused and took the bike by hand to the place where we rented it. They reacted like it's a normal thing, we were trying to tell them that someone emptied the tire and even showed them pictures of the guys selling the air tubes, but they didn't really care."
Beautiful place to spend an afternoon wandering around both the ruins and restored buildings. Great informative displays and videos all around to explain the history.
"We walked to the imperial citadel. It is a big sprawling complex, & hot!! So, make sure you go as early in the morning as you can. We took about 2-3 hours looking at all the buildings & displays. We didn't heave a guide, but the explanations on the display boards were adequate for us to get an understanding about the place & it's importance to Vietnam. There are lots of opportunities to sit & reflect in cool pavilions."
It's an impressive sight and the video at the start helps to put everything into context. There are lots of visitors but there's plenty room to make you feel separate from everyone else. The various buildings are intricate and quite beautiful - the nicest part was a small garden to the east side. The visit is a great opportunity to take some nice photos.
"The whole area is huge so it needs a good time to walk around. It's interesting enough but all very Chinese in style, even the inscriptions. As an old China hand I found it a bit disappointing."
"Get your walking shoes out for this place. There's plenty to see, but it's very spread out, so you'll need well over half a day to see it all. In terms of grandeur, it goes slightly downhill after Ngọ Môn Gate, but it's all still a lovely visit."
"Much has been rebuilt due to wars and bombing, but it's been well done.Like elsewhere in Vietnam, your guide (and yes, you do need one) will over-burden you with facts and history, but go with the flow, its 'part of the deal'. We had overcast sky and drizzle and I still thought it was great - immagine what it would be like in sunshine....."
"We went to the Citadel alone without a guide so we didn't get rushed through! Really amazing, loads to see! Check it out."
"We found this fascinating and spent 7 hours there. No need to have a guide as there are videos and very informative notice boards in some of the buildings. Best to take your own refreshments though, as very limited there."
"Spent a few hours looking around as part of our guided tour. Luckily we had electric carts to ride on, as a lot of area to cover. Unbelieveble history."
"We visited the Imperial City, which is Vietnam's former imperial capital and is recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage site. The area is large and we toured the Capital citadel, Imperial citadel and Purple Forbidden citadel. by foot, going in and out of the monuments.
After so many decades, the monuments are still impressive and restoration works are still on-going. The Citadel's architectural has some western and asian influence.
Do not miss this place if one is in Hue."
We took a trip up the Perfume River and visited the Pagoda and the Citadel and were dropped off and walked to the Imperial Palace
Not as old as you might think dating from 1806...If you have been to the forbidden city in Beijing you may be a little disappointed. The Imperial city was damaged in the war but is now being restored piece by piece. Still nice gardens and nice walk.....take a hat for the sun and plenty of water if its a hot day....you can get water inside at 25K VND (1 USD)
"Our guide had lots of information on this site and pointed out some of the damage still present from the ""American"" war as there was a major battle fought here."
"It's 150,000 dong to get in. They will want to charge you more for guides, and sell you drinks and food (which you need).

If you've been reading other reviews you already know it's large, wear comfortable shoes.

Is it a must see, probably not. Is t a great way to kill a few hours, certainly.

Btw I also recommend grabbing a scooter and visiting th tombs 15 minutes away from the citadel, they are similar but smaller."
"Come here I feel the majestic beauty of Vietnam 100 years ago, the people of Vietnam would probably very proud of this place. Space is very wide, I went to each area to see history, photos and biographies of the kings, really great."
"The Citadel is very reminiscent of the Forbidden City in Beijing but not nearly as awesome. It was heavily damaged during the war and reconstruction is still going on. It is very popular with the locals and a great place to people watch, but don't expect the awesomeness of the Forbidden City."
"Visited earlier today (10am) and it was already almost unbearable heat. Suggest going early or on a cloudy day.

It's a huge complex and very impressive. Some beautiful areas have been restored and there was much more going on.

It's a shame the restoration is taking so long though and it would be stunning if it was just looked after better. If you've visited the Forbidden City in Beijing before then that is much more impressive, so I guess because of that I was a bit disappointed. However having been to a number of historical sites in Vietnam now, this (and in fact most of Hue) is the best kept."
"Spent hours walking around this massive and varied location. Please wear flat shoes and take water with you as the torrain varies from tiled floors to grass and ruins.
A photographers dream location.
It takes many hours to go all around it. You may need to select what you most wish to see if you are short on time. I recommend the royal relics house also part of your ticket in and the treasures stored inside are wonderful."
Foreigners (= non asians) pay 150.000 instead of 120.000.. Not a huge amount more but the principle of price discrimination is just very shocking. Incredibly unfriendly staff. Not worth it!!!!
"Went off the rating on trip advisor, most unimpressed. Not a lot to see and overpriced in comparison to other similar attractions (bai dinh in Ninh Binh)"
"We did the tvisit with a guide, because it was included in a tour. In The imperial city they are building some new constructions. If you are interesting in history or in more than only the beaches and bars, it is worth to visit"
"You can spend hours wandering and discovering. It was picturesque at every corner. Discovering a shop that sold cold beer saved us from the heat and dehydration! A must-see if visiting Hue. A guided tour might provide a better perspective of the city, but I appreciated the exploratory freedom nonetheless."
"A nice place to spend a quiet couplemof hours with lots of history.

Beware of where you park your bikes, lots of scam artists"
"This place is amazing on the eye and photographs fantastically.

As many others have already commented though, lots of reconstruction is currently been undertaken and without a guide (300k each with entry) the site can be hard to navigate around as there is no set route.

A must do when visiting Hue however do your research before heading there and allow half a day for the trip"
Took a walk through on a lazy friday afternoon with the fam. Nice to wander around a bit and have a look but pretty dull really. Buildings are pretty much all the same and you don't get much more by actually going inside.
When a structure takes your breath away the first time you see it you know you have found a place that will be worth your time. This is a very impressive attraction and is worth your time.
"The site is in walking distance of the main town. If you plan to visit other sites, the combined tickets give you a saving on entry fees. We bought a ticket that also allowed us to visit the Minh Mang & Khai Dinh tombs.
It's a big site with plenty to see, so you can spend several hours there if you're interested in history. It was interesting to see the display of photographs of the Emperors, together with their brief histories, and there are a number of temples and palaces enclosed in an impressive fortified wall with a moat. Some areas are in a state of disrepair, but renovation is ongoing."
"The Citadel is a nice visit, but a lot of the site is under restoration, while the wings have yet to be groomed or restored. If you are short on budget, you can skip."
"Besides it's historic credentials as the seat of the Nguyen emperors, this site was extremely heavily damaged during the Tet Offensive, with fighting inside the walls.

Five buildings are original, and many of the others are being rebuilt.

Be sure to employ an excellent guide and give yourself 2 to 3 hours to properly visit the site."
"Includes the emperor’s residence, temples and palaces. In the southwest corner are the three-tiered Hien Lam Pavilion, To Mieu Temple and the 2m tall, 2.5 ton Nine Dynastic Urns (dinh). On the north side, a gate leads into a small enclosure that houses the Hung To Mieu Temple. Open 0700-1730 hrs. Entry 105,000d. Could be maintained a little better."
"We toured the Citadel this morning, a time of day that I would recommend a visit before it gets too hot as the site is huge. There is a succession of wards, with plenty of shade provided by covered perimeter walkways and the key buildings.

The Citadel received massive damage during the 1969-73 war, damage that has been repaired in a sympathetic and parts of the Imperial Palace that was raised to the ground is also going to be re built.

All information provided is in Vietamese and English in a user friendly way. Plenty of photo opportunities. A must see when visiting Hue."
"We visited the Imperial city in a a rainy day and it was fine. We had a fun experience too, there was a place which you could borrow imperial dress and take photo, try it."
"Interesting history and architecture of time gone by. Unfortunately it was a rainy miserable day, so we felt we did not see it to its full potential. Very large place where royalty used to abide. It was getting quite busy when we went, would advise going early to beat the rush."
"We visited Hue during March but it was just for one night and we only had a few hours to visit the citadel. It is located around a 15 min walk across the river from the main tourist area of Hue (Imperial Hotel) or you can catch a cab or a cyclo.
It's not too expensive and was a very pleasant way to spend a couple of hours wandering around the amazing buildings. If you're into history then you'll love it."
Only do this trip with a guide as the site is large and you learn much more with a local guide. Interesting architecture and worth a morning visit. Also nice to escape the city.
"Had a lovely stroll around the citadel. It is being renovated in places but you can get a real feel for the history. Good posters with informative information in English.Relaxing and you can find your own solitude to relax.
No places inside to drink other than buying bottled drink. Worth a visit but to get the most of it there is quite a bit of walking."
Loved visiting this impressive place and learning about the history of the imperial palace. There was also devastation to it and Hue during the war - this country and its people have endured so much. This is a must see when in Hue.
Very busy visit. Be prepared for a lot of walking. You are able to wander around the whole area and explore but there is not much in the buildings. Disappointed that the most important building was a ruin.
"It's a good place to visit in hue gets you away from the busy traffic and into to the olden times, very good."
Many different buildings / temples surrounded by a moat. Interesting site to explore - a range of buildings to visit and wander round. One of the highlights of visiting Hue.
"Worth a visit. Plenty of information to read (in English) and you can learn much about the Nguyen Dynasty in Viet Nam. Tour guides available. Entrance Fee 150,000 VND. Beautiful grounds and buildings. When we visited, they had a traditional musical group performing at 2pm, near the Emperors main welcoming building, Thai Hoa Palace. Not sure if this happens daily."
"I've heard from people that it's nothing compared to the forbidden city in China, but since I've never been to China and it was the first kind of palace like this that I've ever been to I found it great.
The information they provide in some of the rooms are really interesting and informative. The buildings, although some have been destroyed, area beautiful and the park is nice!
The whole area is pretty big but it doesn't take too long to explore a bit."
"A must to visit when you stop by in Hue. Beautiful detailed palace.
For anyone that is unsure about the empire costume, just ask someone at counter. We thought it was close with the way it was set out but when asked, we were told the price and then moved to another room to get dressed and photo was taken. It was a quick process but fun.
Also it was nice to have photographers standing by the gate. They took some shots and was able to picked them up on the way out if you decide to buy then. Afford price."
"I’m sure in it’s hay day this was a spectacular place to visit however much of it has sadly been left to become ruins (there did look to be a lot of restoration work going on however I’m not sure how much of a difference this will make). It’s worth it if you have an hour or so to kill but personally I don’t think it’s worth going out of your way for. If you do go, be warned the signage to the ticket office is extremely poor (it’s near the flag pole)"
"Hue Imperial City is a wonderfully restored architectural heritage area. The many pavilions and courtyards are stunning relics of an Imperial period so full of riches and a unique lifestyle. Great photo exhibitions were very informative.

Still many buildings are being restored or left in ruins, but is is definitely worth visiting as an enriching cultural experience."
"This is worth the visit. Although much has been destroyed during the war, much is left to appreciate. The Queens quarters I think are the high lite of the property.
Walk the grounds for there are other nice things to see.
Plan on about a half day."
"Drizzly grey day when we visited. Bought tickets for the Palace/Forbidden City at 150vd each, about £5. Film showing history and layout was good. Forbidden City, although large grounds was a bit disappointing. Felt that buildings and gardens could have been better maintained. Not much furnishings but seem to have more of an interest in gift/souvenir shops in this complex.
Worth a visit just for a peaceful walk."
"While much of the original Imperial City here in Hue was destroyed during the Vietnamese/American war, they have been working to repair much of it back to the original designs. They provide a great video about the history of the complex that gives you insight into the different parts and how it was used throughout the past 200 years. The buildings that survived and the restored buildings are all very beautiful, with very detailed artwork. The complex is rather large, but you can easily explore it all in one morning or afternoon. Definitely worth a visit to experience some of the history of Vietnam."
Lovely historical place. See evidence of American bombings though yet no resentment. Large area. Worth the visit
The citadel was - in my opinion - not worth the time spent there. It was quite boring and we never fully appreciated the history of the place. Maybe due to poor signposting?
So we didn't get a guide & the map on the back of the ticket was next to useless. We walked straight ahead to some big buildings looked around & there didn't appear to be much to see. One of our group was a bit disappointed but the rest of us wondered off & discovered the main parts which were very impressive. Basically turn left after you enter & you'll find the best bits to see first. Also the exit is at the opposite end to the entrance. If we'd known this it would have saved us from lots of extra walking.
Enjoyed the Citadel or what was referred to as the Purple Forbidden City. Once you go there you will see why it's called that with all the beautiful flowers. Loved the architecture and history with all the pictures telling the history.
it used to be great in past and will great again after most of ithas been rebuilt but currently most of buildings just exist on a future plan.much of this impressive city has been restored and they continued to work o it.
"A large, interesting historical site. We meandered thru without a guide and enjoyed the peacefulness and beauty of the place. There is enough English signage to give you a perspective of what the buildings were and what the kingdom was about.
However, we made a circuit of the grounds and returned where we began, only to be prevented from exiting there. There was nothing at the entrance to let a tourist know, that the egress was in a different location. After a long walk in the hot sun already, this tidbit of information might be useful to someone else."
A very interesting historical site. Hire a bicycle to cycle round the citadel's outer walls. A guide is a great help to explain the history and create the bigger picture of life at the citadel over the years. Well worth a visit.
The area is quite large about 38 hectares with some historical buildings intact with the grand palace of the last dynasty of Nguyen and Goddess-heavenly pagoda. A must visit when in Hue.
Disappointing. Most of it is been rebuilt at the minute and is not as impressive as the tombs around Hue
Self explanatory. Don't miss this. You can feel the history and culture. Bring a snack or eat before as there is no proper foods to be had. Lots of walking. Read about the history before and 100% arrange a guide.Great photo ops. There are some English posted information but you will left to your imagination if you arent a history buff. We went in the rain and had a great time.
"I loved the Imperial City and knew nothing about it til I went there. It is 38.5 hectares of amazing history from the early 1800s. Much of the City was destroyed in wars but some is intact, some has been restored, and more is in the process of being restored. Emperor and Empress palaces, Queen Mother's residence, reading rooms, Royal theatre, am amazing complex to visit."
"An interesting site of great history that is in the process of restoration. Tranquil and sprawling, we purchased a basic entry ticket and just roamed around. Got caught by a cyclo driver at the end though. We just wanted a ride back to our hotel on the other side of the river, however he took us on a tour of his fiends gift shops and actually had no idea where our hotel was. We also made the mistake of not having exactly the correct amount of change that was the initial agreed price for the journey, ripped off."
This is a huge property with many buildings to see including a temple where the ashes of the former royal family are held. You need to remove shoes so be prepared. The buildings have in large part been restored and in good condition. This is a signiificant historical site for Vietnamese so expect to see many including young couple getting wedding pictures taken with the beautiful backdrops. There are very few washrooms on site and the one we did use was not very clean. Be prepared.
"We decided to go here because it wasn't raining (like it had been for the previous 2 days) and it seemed like it was the main thing to do. We arrived at the entrance gate and were shocked that we had to pay 150,000VND each for entrance! But we'd been inside for the last 2 days so we decided to bite the bullet and just pay for it. When we got in we were very disappointed.. We walked around for about an hour before we got bored. There was lack of things to see and without a guide you didn't know what you were looking at or where you should visit.

Also they do horse and carriage rides and they were using a horse that was lame and obviously in pain, which is hardly fair."
"Lots of history and artifacts here. Great restoration work is going on, love to see it when more is complete."
We were just transit in Hue and only have one afternoon thus decided to do this one. Well maintained and not super crowded with tourists. Took us about 3 hrs to finish the whole tour.
The restoration of the Imperial City is amazing. Our family enjoyed the visit and stepping back in time.
"If you have been to Beijing's Forbidden City this place is like the quirky cousin.

Similarly laid out in the Oriental style to promote harmony, it's a charming place to wander around. Beautiful restored buildings surrounded by gardens sit next to crumbling structures yet to be restored and those reduced to rubble; destroyed by the war in the '60s.

Despite this place being the major site in Hue, we managed to wander around and avoid most of the crowds. Many hidden corners to explore, a photographer's paradise.

Inside there are plentiful cafes, toilets and souvenir shops. We found the shops sell a fairly poor selection of goods, however.

There was also a place you could pay to dress up in imperial clothes if you are into that. It seemed a bit tacky though.

It is possible to buy a combination ticket with the tombs on the outskirts of Hue. We preferred to pay slightly more and dedicate a day to the Imperial City however - it takes at least half a day to look around it properly.

The Antiquities Museum is also included in the ticket to the Imperial City.

Tip - many buildings require you to remove your shoes: bring socks with you if you don't want to walk around barefoot."
"My wife and I found this to be an amazing place to just wander around. Many of the buildings are under renovation but there are still plenty to walk around and study the intricate stone carvings and detail of a past empire. We were there around midday and the place was crawling with tourists but it wasn't as bad as I'd expected. One thing to keep in mind is if you arrive by taxi (as we did) you have to almost run the gauntlet of Cyclo drivers and ""Tour Guides"" who line the entrance to the place. Once inside it's ok as they can't actually get in. All they can do is take you for a ride outside the perimeter. Just take some comfy shoes as the Imperial City is quite vast."
All of us visited the citadel on our second day here. This marvelous complex survived the war and you still can see a lot of bullet holes and damage walls in and outside the old city. Its just starting to be a big tourist attraction. You need to reserve a lot of time to visit the parts of the inner old city.
"If you like history, architecture, arts - this is for you. We spend 5-6 hrs there (our hotel told us it's 1-2 hr visit). It's an absolutely beautiful place - highly recommend it"
"Hue Imperial city brings you to the old Vietnamn. Rent a bike and get to the old city. the trip by it's self is worth as much as the ancient city. At the city, there were many school girls and boys beautifully dressed. The place was lively but mostly by locals..
I missed a shop"
The imperial city is surrounded by a river that is surrounded by land and walls that is surrounde by a river that is surrounded by land and a big wall... An guess what? On one side there is river...
"Only wish I'd allowed more time in our itinerary to visit Hue - it's an amazing place, and the Citadel exceeded my expectations. The architecture and fascinating history make this a 'must see' attraction if you're visiting central Vietnam."
"Somehow in my opinion, this place have very little to offer in comparison to Beijing Forbidden City because in Beijing, you can see the Royal chambers, the different places for the queen and other Royal consorts, the meeting place and others. The artefacts of different dynasties can also be identified in Beijing. However, I don't see these happening in Hue."
"We had a private tour with Ha and really enjoyed it. It was interesting to hear about the 13 kings during the Nguyen Dynasty and see the remaining buildings, and also the damage caused during the American-Vietnam war."
"We visited as part of our tour and this was a very interesting area, especially the effort being put into renovations."
A great place to visit with many iconic sites. Make sure you have plenty of time and a guide. There is so much to take in. Getting there early is another useful tip. Photos look better!
"I read all the reviews, both good and bad about the Citadel before visiting, and quite frankly don't understand the reviews that say there's nothing to see here. It's a huge site with an amazing history and we loved every minute of it - and wished we had even more time to explore.

What I would say about the site is that it does lack good interpretive signage, which means it is a little difficult trying to navigate your own way around (and understand what you are looking at) if you visit on your own. For that reason I'd strongly recommend hiring a guide. We did - and it was money well spent."
"Allow at least half a day and wear comfortable shoes. The many buildings and structures are in reasonable condition, the surrounding garden areas could be much improved very easily. Certainly a highlight of visiting Hue, do not miss."
"the most important point when visiting Hue. highly recommend you to have tour guide to explain everything for you (they can speak in any languages). despite of some on-going construction, however it's great enough to observe and understand.
it would take 3 hrs to visit."
"My husband enjoyed this. Clearly for the history lovers, but be aware only a very tiny proportion of what you see is original. It seems to be constantly being rebuilt almost."
"For a complete visit travelers should plan a half day. There are multiple buildings to see and to visit. There was a group of musician playing old music with instruments from the same period, without mentioning the costumes."
"Fabulous construction. Gives a real sense of what imperial life was like. A very worthy visit. Close to city, so no trek to get there."
"Paid 150vd entrance fee (locals only pay 120vd!! See if you can pull off being a local!!)- we didn't want to join the hotel tour which included watching Kung fu shows etc for about 12usd. Taxi from our hotel which was across the river was only 25vd, definitely worth it in the heat! (Use the green Mai Linh taxis). You can also get the boat to cross the river but you would need to walk to your hotel too. Only cost us 40vd for 3 people.

Agree with previous post that the place could be made more tourist friendly such as audio guides. There were guides available when you buy tickets but we didn't bother. The artefacts etc are all labelled with descriptions etc.

Enjoyed sitting in the garden areas overlooking the pond which was very picturesque and a lovely way to cool down and unwind.

Takes about 2 hours to have a good look round. Can't exit the way you entered there are signs to direct you out through the side (probably a few ways to get out)."
The citadel provides a fascinating glimpse into the life and times of Vietnam's Emperors. Take time to wander through its restored palace and gardens. Some structures are still in ruins but restoration is under way. There is a comprehensive display of photos from the Emperor's era with interesting explainations.
We scootered here on a nice morning to go around the old city. Price wasn't too bad but not worth the trip. Not a very informal tour not was it interesting. None of the buildings had a wow factor about them and have of it had been or was under renovation.
The imperial city is a beautiful walk through time. However make sure you have good shoes on as it is massive and I think near impossible to see the whole thing in a day. You don't need a guide as there is a lot of information available but do your research and decide where you want to go in advance
We visited Hue and the citadel a couple of weeks ago .You do need to leave a good couple of hours or more to explore . It is worth it. It is so good to see the government trying to renovate so that we can see what it was like in its time
Nice to see but not amazing. Probably needs a bit more renovation/refurbishment/structure to make it more visitor friendly. I.e audio guides - must see parts.
This is spectacular. The history is amazing. Make sure you get a guide or you will miss out. It is not expensive at all. Also a suggestion we always arranged out own tours there were four of us the driver and guide sometimes the guide was the driver as well. You get such great service and you are not just with a large bus full of people being herded around and not being able to hear. Also find out at your hotel what time the major tours are and you can work around !
The Citadel and Imperial City should be first on anyone's list who visits Hue. The buildings and grounds are impressive and to do it justice at least a half a day could be spent here. It's crowded but there are also many places you can find where you are the only one admiring this magnificent architecture and watch the careful restoration that is going on.
"We unfortunately didn't have much to enjoy the vast area of the Hue citadel. Wish someone had mentioned it to us beforehand.
My message then is leave enough time. It's a big area and though being renovated there's still lots to see and appreciate."
"Worth a visit and some parts are really interesting and unique. I found the ""beds"" in the section containing the photos of the emperors intriguing. Be warned a lot of the facilities were damaged by war and others just neglected by the government for many years so are in a state of decay, The present government is busy with extensive renovations.."
Yes to the scale but considering the oldest original building still there is only about 100yrs old it is not that interesting! The majority of buildings have been refurbished or rebuilt in the 20's and 50's and they are still rebuilding quite a few more. If you like the 'Disney' effect you'll love this. If you are like me looking for the real old history unaltered than it will disappoint. The less famous Tu Duc & Minh Mang tombs are way more impressive!
You could spend over a day here if you want to see everything. Although it does get busy the city is quite large so you never feel hemmed in.
"I've been to many UNESCO World Heritage sites around the world an each one of them have a lot of history to offer. The imperial city is somewhere in the middle of being restored and original; around one corner you would see old ruins, and directly across the walkway you would see brand new restored parts... The restoration is honestly not the best I have seen; it looks like more attention is being paid to the amount of time it takes to complete, rather than quality. There were workers everywhere, power tools buzzing, and the familiar smell of wood stain.

I didn't get a tour guide, but they are available at the entrance on the right hand side as I only had about an hour and 45 minutes to explore and knew a bit of the history already. One of the neatest things was the throne, but photos are not allowed inside that building. There were also cigarette butts and litter in a fair number of places on the grounds which really detracts from the experience.

If you are in Hue, it's pretty much mandatory that you visit this site; if you do it yourself allow 1-2 hours to see it and explore. There are souvenir shops on the grounds as well with quite inflated prices..."
"We were unsure about visiting the Imperial City (150,000 Dong entry fee) but are happy we made the effort and spent a few hours wandering the grounds and becoming familiar with this interesting moment in Vietnam's history.

The grounds are huge, but not immaculately kept and maintained like other UNESCO sites. A bit of maintanance was being completed in different areas, so it's good to see they are attempting to restore the beautiful buildings.

Would recommend visiting even if you are on a tight budget as there are some gorgeous structures still standing from the 1800's."
"I would have thought such a important cultural site would have been maintained to a standard. I understand that Vietnam is a poor country and it would be hard to upkeep such as this palace, but surely the lawns could have been mowed, and not be knee deep grass."
"I don't get why it is such a famous tourist attraction right now. It used to be great in past and will be great again after most of it has been rebuilt, but currently most of the buildings just exist on a future plan. Just don't expect too much!"
"Although largely destroyed by wars, much of this impressive city has been restored and they continue to work on it. Excellent representation of their imperial past."
This was a great way of spending a couple of hours. It reminded me of Beijing's Forbidden City and provides a glimpse at a different side of Vietnam's history. Definitely worth getting a guide to get the background. We visited just after lunch which was great as wasn't too busy.
"There is lots to see on this site -palace, theatre, library, temples etc. It is beautifully kept with some excellent decorations. Take a guidebook or have a guide so that the history of the place can be explained to you."
"We visited Hue whilst staying in Danang (3 hour car ride), specifically to visit the Citadel & the large flag tower. It was extremely hot when (March) so do take water with you. It is a fascinating place which they are starting to restore. There are several reminders of the war with bullet laden structures / walls in many places. One for the history buffs to enjoy."
"It pays to do your homework on this one or get a guide. There is lots to know that you wouldn't get from just looking around.

I am impressed with the reconstruction after two wars. It will be even more amazing once it is all complete."
Hue Imperial City is a magnificent monument and one that is essential to visit when in Hue. 2-3 hours is good enough to walk around it and to see some of the more far flung sections.
"What a marvellous example of Vietnam's not so long ago past. It's a huge area, so be prepared for a couple of hours here. Laid out very methodically, it shows a very structured past that ruled for over a century behind these walls. We took a private guided tour, which cost an extra 150000 + tip on top of our entrance fee and it was well worth it. The complexity of the lifestyle would well and truly have eluded us otherwise. Definite must in Hue."
"This place is huge. Be prepared for a lot of walking about and tired legs.

Good to see how the all poweful emperor lived served by lowly serfs of yesteryear!"
"I say that because around every corner I imagined how grand it must have been to live during those times of such majesty. It is a city within the city. The buildings and their surroundings show off what it was like to live during the centuries past. The buildings have aged gracefully and there are numerous pieces of royal art to be admired within the walls and acres and acres of sights. Including beautifully maintained gardens.
Plan on at least two hrs. to absorb these amazing times in their culture. Bring bottled water and even a picnic. Enjoy!"
Clearly this was a great place once nut it was badly damaged by the French during the colonial wars - they also took much of the treseaurs. Well worth visits for half day and not far from the town.
"The Imperial Palace and Citadel are very impressive. Though most of the buildings were destroyed by natural disasters and war, the ones that remain or have been restored are very interesting. The highlights are the Imperial Reading Pavilion, and the Imperial Theater.

Don't miss the mandarin house on the left right after you come through the first palace, as it offers a lot of historical background. I would also recommend downloading or printing a map and overview of the complex before going, since the signage is very poor.

Admission is 150,000 VND."
We went without a guide and were still able to understand what the citidal was about. They are still working on parts of the citidal but there is still lots to see and enjoy. A great insight into history.We did notice that tourists do pay more to visit but it was worth the extra which to be honest is not expensive.
Wonderful place to see! Will take about half a day to get through it at a leisurely pace. Lots to see and very interesting. Beautiful buildings.
Beautiful restored as well as ruins of the Imperial City. Quite a beautiful site and historically intriguing
the site is impressive addition to being careful .Aparte that you tell the story is a very nice place to walk and enjoy
"I had my review already formulated before my exit so that was just icing on the cake. Where do I begin? Is this really a UNESCO site? Have they lowered their standards to qualify? Have they laxed their enforcement? This is basically a sprawling pile of ruble upon which they seem to be building some buildings. Even that which is original is not all too ancient. The whole thing only dates back to the 1800's and those don't look to be preserved or restored just refinished or rebuilt and repainted. This site would be better left the pile it is and designated a WHS as an example of the tragedy of war. Then there's the management. Gift shops in these revered spaces selling wood carvings of golfers? A room where if you pay you can have your picture taken on a royal throne? No artifacts to speak of? And one exit? Seriously? After walking the huge compound looking for something to get wowed about and finding nothing, I headed back to the front gate to exit near my scooter which was parked in front. But had to (as directed by the guard) walk half way back and to the easternmost wall to exit and all the way I am thinking ""let me guess, there's something to buy that way""...not disappointed there."
"Take a walk by the old Vietnam-s imperial complex. A true pity that with so few time the citadel have been turned into rumble, but the essence of the Nguyen dynasty is still present. The palace of the mother queen is the one that best gives you the idea of how the life was. Some more indications (maps) could be provided."
"Although this place has been destroyed by war, they have restored with utmost care and still carrying out few renovations. Because i go there by tour so i explored history about Royal Citadel. Besides, the documentary shown was decent. we recommend anybody to take a guide to have a good understanding of the place.

The museum inside was also great. You get to know how the kings administered as well. the trip is so perfect!!!!!!"
"It's ancient, beautiful and also a historical place. Every tourist who visit to Hue city should come there. the atmosphere is very pure."
"The Imperial City in Hue, also known as ""The Citadel"", is from the time of the emperor Gia Long. He ordered a huge, 2.5 x 2.5 km area walled and fortified, the building began in 1804. The emperor's palace within is near the river, on the east side of the citadel.

A large number of buildings and palaces was subsequently added, eventually the complex consisted of tens of buildings and hundreds of rooms. Time, termites and storms caused damage during the years, but the area was still very impressive until the Vietnam war.

During the NVA and VC's attack in the Tet-offensive 1968, Hue was the site of most heavy fighting. The Imperial City suffered massive damage, large parts of it were practically wiped out.

The City was eventually made an Unesco Heritage site in 1993 and rebuilding started. Some preserved palaces have been repaired and the work continues. The Imperial City is quite impressive despite the destruction and well worth a visit."
"Beautiful mosaic tiles. Rich teak throughout. A real feel for the court Iife from the late 1800's until the abdication of Bo Dai. Viet Cong as well as NVA troops hid out here during the Tet offensive of January1968. Bombing by US forces caused extensive destruction; however, much as been or is being restored."
"Great ambience here. Though this place has been destroyed by war, they have restored with utmost care and still carrying out few renovations. There was no guide available by the time I went. But the documentary shown was decent. But recommend to take a guide to have a good understanding of the place.

The museum inside was also great. You get to know how the kings administered as well. Over all loved the place."
Went here one afternoon as it is a must do activity when in hue. There are lots of buses parked up outside but once we got in and started walking around you really didn't notice that many. There are lots of different things to see so give yourself a minimum of 2-3hrs to walk around And take in the old. If your into photo taking lots of nice little photo spots. Worth a visit.
"A large imperial city which reminded me of the Forbidden City in Beijing. There has been a fair amount of restoration, enough to give you a feel for what the place used to be like. While more should be done, it preserves a feeling for the turmoil and conflict that was Vietnam for many years. There are good displays of photographs which trace some of the history of the place. An enjoyable visit.
A tip - buy a combined ticket for 3 or 4 sights in the city - valid for two days and it will save you money."
"Since my last visit 8 years ago the Citadel has been further renovated and many informative boards have been put up - just as I enjoyed the many flower arrangements in the garden. Read about the history, close your eyes, and you can easily imagine the times not so far away."
Not really worth it. Unfortunately largely destroyed and partially rebuilt but not very old in the first place.
"Although badly damaged in various wartime offences the ramparts remain in original state as well as some of the internal constructions.

some of the reconstructions are no so sympathetically done - but still good to see"
"The private quarters of the Emperor occupied 10 hectares . He was the only one able to penetrate and the empress, concubines and eunuchs mandarins. The city was almost completely destroyed following the Tet Offensive in 1968. The restoration is in progress."
Visited on a private tour. The site is very large and much of it is yet to be restored. Those sections that have been are wonderful. Beautiful designs and bright colours. I had no idea that the citadel was a relatively recent construction and that the Royal family only gave up their powers in 1945. Well worthwhile.
"This Unesco World Heritage Site provokes ambivalent reactions. On the one hand, it is a Must-see with beautifully kept parts; on the other hand, a number of the central parts are in an alarming condition. The Unesco status should be suspended until further work is carried out and more effort is shown."
Excellent visit full of history and culture history. Visited on my own so relied on booklet information but as the site is so vast I had the time for a leisurely visit allow a good half day to really appreciate its history.
It is an amazing space but with many buildings destroyed (due to several wars). You can see a lot of them being restored. It deserves a visit.
"The ""must see"" restoration of The Citadel is amazing. Though damaged extensively during the ""American War"" it looks ""like new"" in most parts of the complex, with work still going on, funded by Unesco"
"It was an interesting place and historically really important. There was not actually much to see, because there usually was foundations and a sign that said something was here once. Also, we were on a budget and the citadel was really expensive. So if you are interested in history I recommend, but otherwise you might want to skip it."
"Hue's 'Citadel' ... it is really magnificent, so much more than I expected. It's about one kilometer square surrounded by massive walls and a moat ... the citadel of residence of the Nguyen Emperors until Vietnamese Communism over-threw them in 1945. There were originally around a thousand architectural feature (palaces, buildings, grand halls and statuary etc) But the communists denounced the whole place as 'imperialist' and let it slowly go to ruin. Then Americans bombs nearly finished the job in the 'American War' (they call it that, and not the Vietnam War as we do in Australia). Outrageous behavior by all concerned!!

Later the government realized it was an incredible tourist magnet and have been rebuilding and restoring it to a remarkably high standard. Probably bout a third finished. The Palaces and Temples, gardens and other buildings are wonderful, with a glorious Royal Red dominating many interiors.

It all speaks of a very powerful and culturally sophisticated regime. On display are wonderful photographs from the late 1800's, showing the Emperors and hundreds of court officials, concubines, children, dignitaries and even elephants in grand ceremonies and coronations, that really give another level of appreciation to the very ground I was walking on. An excellent video adds even more context. It is so much more interesting with that background knowledge. I didn't hire a guide, but I had read a fair amount and Lonely Planet and other guide books suggest the best ways to move around the place and give commentaries.

The Citadel is vast, with much yet to restore, but I walked round for five hours on a very hot day, and was quite knocked out by experience. It was quite busy but at times I was completely alone in gardens and long promenades. Hue itself is lovely town, and relatively laid back for a town of one million."
Really interesting place with different houses and palaces. Well maintained. Is the most visited place in Hue. Better visiting with an expert guide.
"Make sure you have plenty of time and comfortable shoes this place is vast and there's lots of different areas to see!

Would be worth hiring a tour guide so you get the full history!"
"Hué Imperial City is a must when visiting Hué for the first time. This historic site is vast and takes at least half a day to visit. Come equipped with a good pair of walking shoes and a bottle of water.

Even though not the entire site is yet restored, most areas remain accessible to the public.

Our favourite: the Emperor's Reading Room and the Royal Theatre.

Enjoy!"
"Our tour guide, Dang, from Indochina Odyssey Tours was an excellent source of information at this site. I would highly recommend him to anyone travelling with this tour company. I was unaware of any other ""forbidden city"" other than the one in Beijing. Although a good portion of it had been destroyed by bombs, the site was interesting and I learned much more of the history of Vietnam from our visit."
City is big n better to take electric cars to see the city. City is yet to be built as major items are yet to be restored.
"to learn about the history of the citadel, and the inhabitat in days gone by. Very interesting monument. Too bad parts were destroyed by the Americans"
Spent a few hours wandering through the gardens and buildings - it was beautiful. The Imperial Garden was empty! Wear decent shoes and allow plenty of time to explore here.
Lengthy walk from town. Worth the visit. So interesting. Mind boggling that it only ceased in 1945. Takes a good couple of hours at least to walk around. Most people had hired guides (available at entrance). We didn't. Saw the film and felt like we had a good grip on things!
There's so much history here and our tour guide thru Asia Travel & Leisure was fantastic as he seemed to touch on the important points which was enough of the information we needed to understand the once magnificent Imperial Palace. I'm glad we saw it.
This place is included in the tour package. It is old and is in a much smaller scale of the Forbidden City in China. It does have a lot of history and more visitor-friendly than the overcrowded Beijing jewel.
"It was imperial !!
It's unbeliavable to imagine this city alive !
During the visit there is a little movie with a 3D reconstruction of the imperial city !! Really nice idea !!
The last building who can see are really amazing !!
A place you have to visit in Hué !!"
"If you are in or near Hue you must have a look at the Imperial city. We drove up from Hoi An and must say the travelling was worth it. This is a perfect opportunity to sample the history and culture of Vietnam. Unfortunately our guide was not very good but we managed to listen in on other tour parties to learn enough about the site to appreciate its importance and value. Some of the buildings are in very good condition, other not so but still retain a certain something to make everything worth while seeing and with plenty of restoration work in progress you can imagine how nice the site will be once everything is back to its former glory."
We had an hour or wandering around - it must have been magnificent in its day but we felt uninspired compared to many of the other Pagodas and Temples we had seen on our amazing motorcycle tour with HueRiders. Some interesting exhibits but poorly sign posted and just missed the spot for us.
"first, the destruction should be considered a war crime. Second hats off for them trying to rebuild an important part of their history. What remains only lightly touches upon what must have been a truly beautiful and special place. We spent an entire day here just exploring the grounds and seeing what little is left. Is it worth it? Absolutely, but don't expect the Forbidden City."
"Very large complex though not nearly as large as the Forbiddin City in China. Lots of walking, lots of steps. In the process of restoration. Really needs it, much was destroyed in the war. Must see in Hue."
"If you are in Hue, then the Hue Imperial City (the Citadel) is a must see to gain a better appreciation of the strong Chinese influence in Vietnam, as well as the city's significance as the former imperial capital of Vietnam. The grounds are large and the most interesting portion is the Throne Palace. Sadly, much of the Forbidden Purple City was destroyed during the Vietnam War (Tet Offensive in 1968) and of the @160 buildings that once were housed inside the Citadel, less than a dozen survived intact. International aid has allowed the restoration of some of the more prominent buildings with more promised to come."
Beautiful and amazing history and cultural experience. Amazing photo opportunities. Spectacular architecture of ancient buildings and history. Great movie/video available to watch when you first enter that gives a great overview of the imperial city.
"Took longer than we expected, large in size, restoration is ongoing. Sad to think of how much wax destroyed in the war."
"We had the 3 site ticket for 280.000 VDN and visited the citadel and also two tombs!
We were very disappointed visiting the citadel! For this price we expected more than just a golden chair and some destroyed walls and houses. Think about visiting the citadel twice! But the tombs are definitely worth a visit!!!! I would absolutely recommend them instead of the citadel!"
The emperors clearly planned on a large scale and expected to be around a lot longer than things turned out. You need a country working hard to keep an estate on this scale up to scratch.
"The former Vietnamese Royal Palace has been partially restored to provide an intriguing glimpse into the lives of the Nguyen dynasty. I particularly enjoyed the examples of the King red penning official documents. Some things never change.
The buildings and grounds are really beautiful and work continues to restore the site further.
Thoroughly recommended."
Truly fantastic palace with extensive grounds with a pagoda every place you look. Spend the extra money ($12) to get electric ground transportation.
"The first time to visit Hue City, I heart so much about the Imperial Citadel here, then what I saw is not as like as my expection. I came here in a raining day, the ground was so slipped. There are so many broken thing that should be rebuild."
"The imperial city is one of, if not the highlight of a visit to Hue. Give yourself plenty of time to look around as there is a lot to see. It gives the impression of being much older than it actually is but when you take into consideration the battering it took in the war it is hardly surprising. It's a must see if you visit Hue"
"The Citadel is a very large site, and you will need to allow a few hours to explore it properly.

It took a little while to work out the site, but you will find many sign boards in three languages that explain all aspects of the site. A UNESO video provides a good 5 minute overview of the sites history.

It is easy to miss some of the detail, make sure you poke your head into every corner of the site. I am not a history buff but really enjoyed my visit, and also the history of the area."
"This is a very large property that housed several Vietnamese Emperors, up until the last one abdicated. It is approximately a mile square, with many buildings and landscaped areas within. The forbidden city is the innermost area of the complex, where the emperor and his Eunuchs were the only men allowed. We visited with a private guide, who was extremely helpful in providing the historical context as well as interesting details about the various structures.
Some of the buildings have lovely mosaics and artwork. One building had a number of paintings that were very beautiful . They were painted on glass from the back so the artist had to paint a mirror image of what the viewer would see. These are wonderful! Another room is where the opera was staged. There are stage sets and costumes that can be rented for a negligible sum so you can be photographed in the regal silk finery.
One building has beautiful statues of elephants, horses and soldiers. The landscaping is beautiful as well.
I highly recommend visiting this complex."
"The most important attraction in Hue, the Citadel is magnificent and a must see. Recommend you go with a guide to maximise the experience and gain some good knowledge about its history, but there is also a bit of information within. Beautiful place!"
Really good to see and much bigger than expected. Make sure you allow enough time to wander. We were on a group tour and there just wasn't enough time.
"We were here with a personal tour guide. My wife's friend who is a pinai doesn't Vietnamese, so we got a tour guide who spoke english. The tiur service we used was Saigon Tour which had exceptional service."
"The place is huge.
They need to distribute some fliers at the entrance though. Luckily we stopped at the main building and noticed there was a 15minute video explaining what is what and what is where.
Ticket was 150K which is ok i think. No attraction for night life seekers of course... hah!"
"Highly recommended attraction. Vietnamese history is very fascinating and it we really enjoyed the tour. It takes a while to walk all around it, so be prepared. It's absolutely beautiful"
"It is very very big and full with number of tomb, palace, temples and historical monuments. Take the free map at the ticket counter and plan accordingly to make sure you cover everything within this Citadel as there is so many things to look for.

Looks crowded but actually it is not that crowded due to its size. Very impressive and well maintain. Lots of walk so be prepared with cold water and towels.

Really really impress with this monument. Very beautiful and Lot to learn about this historical sites in Hue."
The history of the area is very good and having a guide is important. Found similarity with the Forbidden City in Beijing but on a much smaller scale. Worth a visit.
"I had arrived Hue since 2015 and i very happy when visit Imperial Citadel. Although Imperial Citadel is large area and walk so much. But so impressive, it's ancient and beautiful. When i tired, i seat on the benches, under the trees. It's very cool and make me relax, i can lie down to avoid the sun. I took a lot of photos at there but it's not enough, the Citadel has many places to sightseeing. I will comeback Hue to explore again."
"I was very impressed by it! Totally worth visiting, especially when there are no so many tourists. You will get a chance to walk around and to feel the ""touch of eternity""."
"This place is huge, interesting to learn the way of life and see some of the artwork and read about the history, enormous and so interesting."
A World Heritage Site. Reminds me of the Forbidden city in Beijing. Built of a grand scale that has to be seen. Plenty to see. Lots of history.
"There is so much to see here that you need to set aside a half day . The gates to this citadel with their faded paint hugely impressed me as did the scale of the buildings . Obviously the Citadel got knocked around a bit during "" the American War"" but extensive restoration work is ongoing and in a few years time l guess it will be difficult to distinguish between what is old and what is new. I often wonder about completely rebuilding places in the name of restoration - principally if a building is several hundred years old at what point in its long history do you ""fix"" the period to restore . I guess here they are working from photographs so it doesn't matter so much because the place was in use by the Royal Family until they relinquished power . Photographs - this attraction is perfect for them so make sure your camera / phone / iPad is charged up and ready to go .lt also has a couple of really good gift shops and if l had not been chivvied out of them l could have spent a lot of money"
A Worls Heritage site and a close walk from most of the popular hotels. Most go with tourist companies but just walked from my hotel (Century Riverside) across the Perfume River and the bridge. The site is under major renovation to retain the history (for better or worse) and is a juxtapose against the 21st Century Hue. Please allow at least 3 hours to wander and read the history of this site
"We walked from our hotel (30mins) and it was well worth it. Impressive architecture and fairly quiet (perhaps due to being rainy) so we had a great walk for a few hours checking out the citadel, taking some good pictures and stopped for a coffee whilst feeding fish in the ponds. Take half a day and visit."
To see imperial Vietnam and learn about history - it is a must see for all tourists visiting the city. 150k VND for foreigners which is 30k cheaper for local Vietnamese can feel a bit of discrimination coming up but that's Vietnam for you!
Lots of walking to see this huge complex. There are a lot of buildings & exhibits to see. Very interesting.
"This is a huge site of royal buildings surrounded by walls and a moat that was the site of the Imperial capital of Vietnam. We came on a day at Chinese New Year when the gates were open to local residents free of charge. The atmosphere was great, with families enjoying the environment. Some were taking advantage of the fancy dress rental to be emperors and empresses for the day. The historic main gate and buildings were well preserved and represent the classic styles of their day. A real treat."
"This place is huge! You can easily get lost and wander around for an hour! I enjoyed being away from the crowded areas better actually, and it was interesting to see areas with bullet holes remaining from the tet offensive fighting that occurred here. Some areas seem to be being restored but they've s long way to go! Nothing like the forbidden city in Beijing but with a little imagination you can picture the Nguyen dynasty emperors!"
"Big complex, be ready to spent there a couple hours. Lots of peaceful corners to relax and take pictures. Time well spent."
"It cost 150k dong for adult but its really nice to get a piece of history although the tombs and the pagoda was bigger, more beautiful and so much more details."
Amazing to see how far the Chinese empire stretched and influenced South-East Asia as a whole.Although it was a rainy day we still dis have a great walk about.
Visited the Imperial city as part of our 4 day tour. Amazing old fortress surrounded by a moat. Definitely worth a visit and enjoyed the tour of the Imperial City.
"This attraction requires considerable walking, but it is well worth it. You may want to hire a guide to get the full impact, although the signage is good and is written in 3 languages. It is a very large venue, so you should allow at least 3 hours, maybe half a day. The history is overwhelming."
"We actually visited the Palace and Citadel in late February 2015. The old history was fascinating, the grounds very spacious, and walking through the grounds can easily take a full relaxed afternoon. The Citadel show the wear and tear from the Vietnam war, and there are displays of American weaponry outside the walls. All very interesting. Beware the tuk-tuk guided tours. They will drive you around the back streets and show you a few historical sites, and while very interesting, not necessarily what y may have had in mind."
Take at least half a day to visit this area. Gives you a great idea what Hue used to be like. worth a visit!
"Nice place and very very big, the entrance fee is 150,000 dong, not the lesser price that's advertised everywhere but it's still worth it, take water shade and a snack, the prices inside are extortionate, also they advertise a guard changing ceremony at 9 am, we were there at 8.45 and it had already happened, aside from those few moans it really is impressive and I would recommend a early morning visit"
Our guide was wonderful explaining th history of the imperial city. We spent the better part of 2 hours. The building are wonderful and steeped in history. They are doing a wonderful job in restoration of some of the buildings. Fascinating glimpse into the court life of the Nguyen Dynasty.
"Our hotel organised a driver to take us here & we had 2hrs walking time. Since it wasn't a guided tour, we maybe didn't hear too much history of the place but we got to wander away from crowds. The gardens & the buildings are so beautiful. We found this amazing building near the edge of the area with a walk way to a giant willow surrounded by a river covered with lillies. That alone made the trip there worth it."
The area is big to explore so take enough time. I would recommend to take a tour guide if you want to know more about the area as most of the signs were already in bad condition that you could not read and study the area by yourself. There is maybe a bit too much to see in one place so the information what you will get can be feel a bit overwhelming. A top place to visit in Hue.
"Since I'm a bit jaded (bad pun) regarding seeing ""must see"" sites, I was more than pleasantly surprised to spend a morning and afternoon wandering around the citadel, visiting the intriguing and beguiling private dwellings of the former emperor and his many concubines (hundreds) and wives...dozens at least! Not to mention tonnes of historical tidbits accompanied by detailed black and while photo exhibitions of royalty here in ancient times. Though it was bombed heavily, they are doing a good job of reconstructing it using the original materials. Well worth visiting! Allocate at least 4 hours."
"A must if you are in Hue. Really interesting. With the price of your ticket you can also get into the museum outside the city walls, you can do this the next day,"
"If you like history/old buildings and lots of spots to explore, this was superb. We drifted over the river to visit in the morning and left reluctantly, with lots more to see, after 3 hours. One of those places you want to go back to-there is so much to see. Several buildings are being reconstructed so it will be fascinating to see it in a few years. Be sure to take your guide book."
"My partner and I very much enjoyed wandering around the Imperial City, which is in various states of renovation. It is an impressive site. There is some fantastic information provided in the museum area which answered many of the questions I'd had whilst travelling through Vietnam, in regards to the French colonial period, the Chinese heritage of Vietnam, and the history of the emperors. Fascinating."
"Great area, wide green gardens, ponds and fish to feed.
The citadel is peaceful and interesting. We noticed they have very good German speaking guides as well.
Foreigners pay more than Vietnamese. ;)"
"it is cheap to get in, you can easily spend many hours in there, you dont need a guide, just walk around by yourself, avoid crowded place and go back later, toilets are awful, so take a dumb before entering, drink water as it is really hot and humid, take a few pictures, not too many as many will be boring..."
By large the most important place to visit. A lot of restoration ongoing. Whatever has been restored is most beautiful. Take your time to visit.
"This destination was okay. In the scheme of things, I wouldn't have been upset if I missed out. We visited just after Chinese New Year & the potted plants were particularly pretty. There were lots of old frangipanni trees, naked at the time I visited, but I imagine they would look lovely in full bloom in spring."
"This is a really nice place to visit. Entrance by main gate into outer compound and then pay to get inside the inner compound. It is like a very small version of the Forbidden city in Bejing.
Some parts are still being renovated and overall a 2 hour visit is long enough."
Great to see the Imperial City. Parts of it are still under renovation but it is lovely to see the old photos and experience this part of history. Definitely recommend if in Hue.
"We visited with a guide and found it very informative and interesting. The audio
visual presentation is worth watching as it gives you a good background and is also a good place to rest from the heat.There has been a lot of restoration there, and although we visited 9 years ago, there there a lot of new restored areas and more interpretative displays now which are written i English.
Well worth a visit."
"The site is huge and unless you booked a tour or hire a guide you'll miss a lot of the history of the place. Takes about 90mins to go around slowly if you skip the extras like dressing up in robes to pose for photos or watching a musical performance. Entry is 120,000d.

The Queen Mother's palace was my favorite, as it has the most detail and is probably the most well-kept corner of the imperial city. The moat and bonsai trees here were the only ones I saw that has been upkept.

Careful when bringing children here, there's a lot of construction and repair happening and it's not blocked off or sign posted. The Northern corner of the city would be beautiful if maintained but is overgrown, which is a shame."
Spent about 3 hours in this palace - helps to give me a brief history of the Nguyen Dynasty and the palace customs. Found them to be very similar to Chinese customs at the time. Definitely worth a visit!
It's basically the remains of what was once a quit big imperial city. There are still some buildings intact and they give a nice insight in the art and decorations of the city. There is a theater in the center where they rehearse during the day and put on shows in the evening. Don't be scared off by the entrance fee. Once you're in you'll forget about it
"This piece of history is a must see. It's hard to imagine.this place in its full glory days but be sure to check out the video in the first main palace where they digitally reconstruct the city.

If you are going to DIY I would recommend reading up before hand as it's not that well documented but there is a route map outside the main entrance..but that's kind of worn out.

There is alot to see so If you like to meander through and not amazing race it, then you will want at least half a day.. Maybe slightly more to appreciate all the areas.

Also if you are DIY be sure to consider a multi visit ticket for the tombs and the city as it works out cheaper."
"Definitely worth seeing, however it wasn't as spectacular as I would have expected!
A major downer for us was that you had to pay extra as a tourist, not a lot extra, but still."
"The imperial city is an interesting place to visit and for 90,000 Vietnamese dong you can go to the imperial city and to two other cultural places in Hue (tombs). It's worth the money but if you aren't with a guide maybe do some research before you go. There is a short video you can watch and several signs with information but it's mostly quite vague. Worth a visit and good value"
"Previous imperial palace of vietnam, nice place with history, i could read chinese and decided to read what is written on the pillars or steele, realise that bullet holes were everywhere, i guess there must be a big fight before enduring peace. Nice setting across the river/moat, there are nice cafes with a good view of the palace."
"Beautiful place, and only a small portion has been restored! FYI, no toilet paper to be found so come prepared. Kids can feed fish for 5000 Dong."
"This is a large complex. We found a band playing and prayers at the temple of the kings.
A great visit, we were offered this as an optional add on to our tour. This is a must if you are in Hue. Allow plenty of time for your visit."
"If you're in Hue, obviously you came to see this. It's the main draw of this city.
Interesting to see the grounds and half fallen- destroyed walls w/ bullet holes from Vietnam Conflict. Some grounds are full of flowers, plants, and other sections is swabs of overgrown grass.
There is one long wall of a bldg that has a chronological order of emperors and their achievements and weaknesses.
Throughout grounds are various bldgs. To many to go into detail of what each one serves. But most of them have been redone or rebuilt from destruction over the years, if not the Vietnam Conflict.

What really tmpressed me was the massive Vietnam flag flying from an elevated rise of complex. The bright red gently flapping in the breeze.

Getting in as foreigners, we were led through a separate door and pay the mandated fee. I'm guessing the nationals are not charged.

There are about 2 vending areas that sell refreshments and snacks.

Time-wise, we spent roughly 3 hrs (?) and that was enough for us. Considering we walked across the Truong Tien bridge.

Enjoy the journey."
"Compared to other prices for attractions in Vietnam, I thought 150,000 VND was quite a lot, but I guess it is quite a large site. I was also disappointed by the few information boards around and the lack of maps available as it made it harder to navigate. Having said that, the citadel was really really beautiful and poignant both in terms the end of the Royal power and the American war. You also can't come to Hue without seeing this, I just think there's room for improvement."
"Not worth the entry fee $20 for two ppl. Its nice but instead you can walk around the old city and see many of sites free.

Or get a cyclo rider for 80k who will take u to all the free places.

Beware the food places on the way out next to main road terrible oily garbage only drunk people giv them good reviews."
I admit that I spend a lot of time reading everything I can and simply standing and staring at architecture or wall reliefs so keep that in mind. Bring some snacks cause there is a lot to see and the gift shops are expensive. There are plenty of places for couples to sit alone in open courtyards or empty lanes with crumbling walls and enjoy a bite to eat to bring your energy back up after a few hours of reading and walking. Totally worth the money. We didn't get a guide but they are available if you want. We just wanted to take our time and not feel like we were rushed. A great way to spend the day
"The imperial City was incredible and much larger than we expected!
I suggest allocating an half to full day to visit depending on your level of interest.
Bring water & your camera!"
"We were suprised with the beauty and calm of the place. Worth the visit, please let you self enough time to visit the whole complex"
"For the price you pay you would think they would maintain the grounds or even cut the grass, was ok but wouldn't spend too long here unless you get a tour guide so you know more info"
"Maybe we had been ""tombs/temples/historied"" out... walked round for about 30 mins and moved on. Im sure the history buffs would enjoy more."
"despite being totally overcrowded on Chinese New Year we would have missed a lot not seeing this old capital, center of the court and residence.It is very impressive in size as well as in detail.An english tour guide would have been good - we would recommend of taking one next time."
The trip to this place will take u about 3 hours maksimum. Here you can Just relax and take your time walking though the history of Vietnams empire. If you r interested in history then this is the place to go. But its too bad some places still need some restauration because huge spot of the palace was bombed to the ground during the vietnam war. The only thing i didnt like about this place was that they place the souvenir shop inside some of the ancient building.. and that they take 150 K for foreigner to entry this place vs. 130K for locals
"Surprised that others mentioned that it didn't live up to their expectations. Enormous site with lots of temples many of which have been well renovated. Lovely ponds, huge amounts of flowers surrounding the buildings and much information about the emperors that have lived there, both in writing, documentary as photographs and artefacts. One can easily spend two to three hours here without getting bored."
We were very impressed by the restauration works and what they have achieved so far. Beautiful flowers in pots everywhere to give the squares and buildings more cachet. It was like if you would walk into a film set to us.
"This ancient city or citadel is a must if you are visiting Hue. Give yourself several hours to do it justice. Our visit was far too brief as part of an organised tour but it will be on our return bucket list.

Whilst a large amount of the Forbidden City has been destroyed through a succession of wars there is still a large amount of the outer city left. Some restoration is and has been carried out. It must have been spectacular in it time. You can just imagine the Imperial Courts. Many people lived within the fortress wall during the war, although some have been relocated there are still some residents remaining.

I recommend a visit of 2 - 3 hours and then a possible return the next day. There is so much to see."
"I found this place amazing. Three layers, a Citadel which then houses an Imperial Palace and a Forbidden City. It is being restored step by step with information in English everywhere.
Beautiful gardens, ponds and buildings scattered around all with long history.
You could spend a day here, plenty of refreshments, toilets and resting places."
It is a large property and it was nice to get the horse ride. The driver waited for you as you stopped throughout several areas of the city. Go to the theatre as the show as nice and it was refreshing to get out of the sun and into air conditioning.
"My wife and I were taken to this attraction by a friend and the amount of history is overwhelming, similar to our visit to The Forbidden City in Beijing, China last year. The grounds are huge and it is sort of like a maze but the history is so fascinating. The architecture of the buildings is interesting and it is nice to see they are continuing renovations on some of the buildings and structures. We visited Hue Imperial City in the afternoon. It would have been nice if this was our first attraction of the day as I believe 3 hours here is a minimum one would want to spend wandering the buildings and grounds. It was nice that they have trolleys in some places to take guests from area to area too. One of the best attractions we attended in Hue."
"Although some of the structures are now in ruins, and most of the significant existing monuments have been partially restored, The Complex of Hue Monuments is stunning."
It's kind of a ruin of the Vietnamese Emperor Palace. A must see in Hue. But you don't expect to see much historical stuff as in Beijing Forbidden City.
"Didn't quite get what I'd hoped for from the 150,000 entry fee but filled a day up with some interesting back story on vietnamese history."
Reminds you of the Forbidden City yet much smaller. Beautiful flowers were everywhere and lovely for photos. We visited this on a motorbike tour that took us to several main attractions in Hue. It was an experience traveling as the locals do.
"An enormous site brimmed with beautiful buildings clearly portraying the regal splendor of the royal Family from a time long gone.

Restoration continues and the buildings look spectacular. The grounds are well groomed and there are lots of walkways"
"The site is good for those who appreciate history and to truly feel like you have stepped back in time. The site has various buildings, arches, carvings, statues, urns and even it's own moat, all of which really add to the sensation that you are entering a special place. The site has plenty of photo opportunities can take a few hours to walk around and see the complex in it's entirety, but can be done in 2 hours if you go at a fast pace and can be visited via a bus tour or via your own transport. The site it still under constant restoration from damage done by the weather and in the Vietnam/American war, but luckily that doesn't detract from its charm. However depending on the weather I would recommend: Water (even if your tour includes it), Sun Screen, Camera, Umbrella or a hat."
"We went to the Citadel very early; it had pretty much just opened. Would definitely recommend this time. For starters, it is very quiet! Not many tourists and only a few workers tending to the grounds. Secondly, it is a lot cooler than it can get during midday and late afternoon. The Imperial City itself was beautiful, however parts of it seemed very unkempt. All in all, still a must do while in Hue."
"The citadel cost 150k to enter, the ticket also includes a museum however we never found this. It took is about 2-3 hours to look and walk around. It was interesting to see and it was nice to explore the quieter areas of the citadel. It reminded me of the film the King and I.
It was not breath taking, and most of it has been rebuilt due to natural disasters and war.
I wouldn't bother cycling around, it is much better to just walk- it is not as big as expected."
This is simply not to be missed! I was in awe of the Forbidden City in Beijing and it would be foolish to compare the two but I was enchanted by the Imperial City.in Hue and could have spent a whole day there.I hope any future restoration does not detract from its charm which it owes in part to its state of disrepair.
"A must see place in Hue. As others have said, go on your own and skip the guide. Plan to spend a few hours exploring the entire complex. Oh, those Americans... Such shame they should feel for all the bombs here a d in Laos."
"The citadel is imposing with its walls and moat. Moving through the main gate you see the main hall, from there many out buildings beautifully decorated. Well worth a visit."
Tranquil gardens to wander round and many impressive buildings. You really need to be accompanied by a guide to fully understand the history of the place.
"This beautiful to walk through and was nice to meander through such rich history. There were many parts that were re built but also many parts that weren't. Quite interesting to see. I would recommend bringing some snacks and water if you get hungry. Food is quite expensive inside. Also, do some readings and research as there aren't many signs that give you a background of where or what you're at."
Interesting to see some of the history of the imperial city. Good video as you enter that explains the different sections of the grounds. The site was damaged during the American war and not all of the structures have been refurbished. It is also hard to get a sense of what it was like when the Emperor lived there since most of the buildings are empty. Bathrooms are horrifically dirty.
"Too many people visit the Imperial City being towed around by a guide and despite the historical briefings they do not get to see as much as they could. Before visiting and whilst you are there, read your guidebook and walk slowly amongst the buildings and marvel in their architecture and design. Take your time to enjoy this wonderful piece of history."
"The Citadel continues to undergo restoration and is still ""the"" sight to see when in Hue. But having visited several times already, I was especially delighted to visit during the Tet holidays. Although painfully mindful of the past history of another such holiday many years ago the temperate weather, the beautiful flowers, the dragon dancers and drummers, and the throngs of native Vietnamese rather than foreigners was enough to make the visit both memorable and meaningful. The almost complete renovations of the porches and the reading rooms or library are very nicely done. The changing displays on life in the royal palace and documents and history are also worth wandering through if the time allows.
You need to allow plenty of time to really drink in the concept of what life is like for a king, and those associated with him. the symbols are also instructive-- for example the walled curtain that separates the public space from the domestic and contemplative spaces. Meanings and messages are expressed subtly here."
The Imperial Citadel is just a shadow of its former self after being bombed during the Vietnamese war. What remains is full of interest and intrigue. Our guide had plenty of stories about the Emperor's lifestyle which were amazing even into the 20th century!
"The Citadel is mostly ruins with some surrounding buildings still standing. You need a bit of imagination to imagine what is used to look like. Not much going on in Hue and this is part of most tours, not sure I would recommend it!"
Lovely place to spend a few hours wandering around. I especially liked to bonsai garden in the top right corner. Also most tourists seem to gather in the central bit so if you go further out there are barely any people
"Amazing site! i enjoyed the walk without a guide, it was great to see a lot of information posted around for those who choose to do it this way. Absolute tragedy what happened but really cool to see what remains is being restored and maintained in such a fashion."
"Must visit! Do not join a tour group: most only give 1 short hour. But the grounds are massive and the Imperial City has an amazing vibe of history, mystery, and encroaching plant life. I wrongly joined a tour thinking that we'd get extra information and lots of time but the guide pushed us through in an hour (we fought back for a little more time) and did nothing but point out the obvious (ex: This is a crumbling building.) Instead, get any guidebook with a detailed map of the Imperial City, pack your bag with food and water, and visit on a sunny day to marvel at the buildings, the ruins, the partially restored, and the future plans. The Co Ha gardens, Emperor's reading room, Can Chanh Palace, Dien Tho Residence, and Thai To Mieu complex are all worth the extra time needed to get around. The Imperial City is really the highlight of visiting Hue so don't cut the trip short.

The site is in the middle of town but quite a long walk (at least 45 min) from where most of the backpacker hotels are. Save your feet for walking around the Imperial City and grab a taxi or cyclo or rent a bicycle if coming more than 2-3 blocks."
"I has visit Hue several times and I don't want to miss this place whenever I come back. I want to remember and learn more about Hue Citadel and Nguyen Dynasty as well as architecture of the Central region.
I highly recommend you to visit this place. It has large space with many areas, with a local guide, you will have an excellent presentation about Hue Citadel.
After that, you can walk along streets, eat something, take photos and enjoy peaceful atmostphere unlike hustle and bustle atmosphere in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City."
"This large complex was built in 1804 by the Nguyen Dynasty. The tragedy is that the huge Forbidden City (where the Emperor and his family lived) at the rear of the complex was bombed by the Americans when other efforts to dislodge a group of Viet Cong failed. Restoration efforts are underway, and it is still worth a visit to see the ruins of the Forbidden City. Take time to go see the Theater which is really beautiful inside."
"A must visit. You will not be disappointed. A lot of walking but well worth it. The ravages of war caused considerable damage but the restoration has been carried out using traditional methods.
Allow a day if you are to do it justice."
"Allow plenty of time to see the palace, as it is a huge site with lots to see and read. In those bits that have been restored there are interesting old photos and very good descriptions in English of palace life that bring the place alive. There appears to be only one exit to one side, but well worth finding the old gardens not far from the exit (although it's not well signposted) as there is a cafe there serving drinks and food in lovely peaceful surroundings."
"The citadel is huge, you could fit an entire suburb in there. Try to get around and see as much as you can, you'll need some time"
"The Citadel has suffered neglect and the ravages of war, but visiting this place still inspires my imagination. I especially loved the photo collection that detailed the daily life of the last imperial dynasty and their entourage. Extensive renovation is underway now -- I hope I get the chance to return someday."
"This is the first place we've visited in Hue, and we really enjoyed it!! Gorgeous scenery, very quiet and relaxing. They also have a video presentation that gives a brief history, as well as an exhibition hall that talks about life in the Imperial City. It was really interesting and gave context to what we were seeing. It's a little bit expensive, but it's definitely worth a visit!"
"The whole citadel is so big, I should spend more time to visit in 1 day. Each architecture building has its own story. I hope there are more visitor information at each place."
I have to say that I was a little disappointed with this. What there is is very beautiful but so much of it has been destroyed during the wars.
"Such a huge complex! You could easily spend a whole day there - not just to see the main buildings but if you have time, there is plenty of small alleys and parts waiting for you to discover. The only disappointment was that after the night fell, the main gate wasn't lighted, that would have been amazing tbh"
"Extraordinary mix of wonderful architecture and scars from the American War. Spacious and opulent. Lacking a little in visitor info, but a worth world heritage site and must be seeb."
"The complex is well worth visiting to see the ruins and other ancient buildings of a lost empire. Don't expect anything like the Royal Palace at Bangkok though; there are a lot of buildings in bad shape here. Closer to the entrance is always packed with tourists and can seem a bit tourist-trap like (there are people hiring out imperial costumes, and a few souvenir stands). I suggest you get away from the crowd and walk as far into the city as you can to get away from the crowds and really experience the buildings, ponds and gardens with no one to bother you. You can walk into some of the buildings as they are not manned. One tip: Bring lots of water!"
"The Citadel gives a glimpse of Vietnam's dynastic past, and is a miniature version of The Forbidden City in Beijing, China. Come here to see mini-me, go to Beijing to see the mother lode. Am interesting fact was that all the housing in The Citadel was filed to the brim when the second emperor of the Nguyen Dynasty (Minh Meng) was in power, as he had more than 500 wives and apparently had the power to impregnate 3 wives in a given night!"
"It is. Must visit. If you go on your own or part of a group you will see the wondrous Citadel and the buildings contained inside.
You will see the history of the Kings which is covered extensively up to 1945 when the puppet King and family, the last king fled to France and when Ho Chi Minh claimed independence.
However they make a passing reference to the extensive damage caused during the Vietnam War and in particular 1968. They also say that the area is being restored. What no guide will tell you or give a proper answer too is why no reference to the Tet Offensive which occurred on the 31st Jan 1968 by the Vietcong who attacked the citadel in the early hours taking it and rounding up ""tyrants"" including German Doctors French and Mennonite from within the citadel only for their bodies to be found months later in areas away from the citadel. The Vietcong then proceeded to fight within the walls when the American and South Vietnamese responded to their attack. 28 days later the citadel was re-taken by the Americans and South Vietnamese. When asked about this we were just told that they were defending the rights of the people against oppression.
It is a Wonderful place to visit but it does not give a clear picture of its history nor the atrocities committed there and close by. History is written by the victor however it shouldn't be falsified for sake of a particular doctrine. I'm British by the way and not an American or Australian."
"My wife and I visited the Citadel and Imperial city on a short visit to the city. The entrance is truly magnificent and a credit to the ongoing restoration project. We visited just before the Chinese New Year and there were beautiful flowers on display. As you walk deeper into this vast complex, there is less complete restoration, and you can let your imagination work out how it must have been in it's heyday. Bullet holes in the exterior walls are a sharp reminder of the Vietnam conflict in the late 60's, and 70's. Well worth a visit."
"We visited the Imperial City in Hue because it seemed to be very famous and worth visiting it. Unfortunately it was more of a disappointment for us. There is not a lot to see and therefore not worth the entry price, even though it's not that much, but still a lot compared to what you get for it."
"This was an interesting site to see. Although most of it was destroyed by American bombs they have done a good job of restoring it. Very ornate and beautiful, and gives a good feel as to how Vietnamese royalty lived in the past."
We spent a couple hours touring the citadel. It was very interesting. Loved the moat and the history.
Interesting to see and also to see ongoing restauration. Enjoyed walk from hotel to citadel although raining.
"The history of Vietnam is so amazing and the architecture is stunning! Make sure you go with a guide who can articulate the significance of the citadel (I went with Swallow Tours who were great). Also, make sure you try on the traditional dress, we were hesitant to begin with but it's definitely worth 95,000 vnd per person for the photos you get!"
The tour of the Imperial City is a worth-while one. It was built modeled on the Forbidden City in Beijing. There are still bullet holes in the walls from the Tet Offensive of 1968.
A must see in Hue. Whilst not old in terms of some Asian or European sights it is still very historical and gives a wonderful idea of what it was in its hey day. Thankfully parts have bee restored to their splendor and other parts are at different stages of restoration.
As the former seat of royal power one would expect to see ornate ceremonial structures. Couple that with beautiful gardens and terrific bonsai trees and the result is this wonderful old historic setting not to be missed.
Old history and new history meet in this poetic place full of hidden small gems. Some of the walls are scarred with thousands of bullet holes from the American War. allow approximately 4-5 hours for the visit. Only couple of places sell food so best to bring own snacks.
"What a shame so much was destroyed in two major wars and in weather! It really must have been magnificent once upon a time. Though with a lot of Vietnamese attractions, so little is done to offer you that chance to relive what it once was... Minimal living features in the existing buildings, very little signs in English with historical explanation and one basic miniature model of the site as it once was...

Still, everyone says go when you come to Hue. So go."
"Amazing, but I think you will appreciate it more with sunny weather and with a guide that explain everything for you. Take your time it's much bigger than you think at first."
"No question about it, this place tops the list of site to see in Hue. It is not only of some historical significance due to the Tet battle during the Vietnam-American war, but it offers insight into Vietnam's history and how their rulers lived - needless to say much better than those being ruled."
Had to come here on our day tour into Hue. The architecture is absolutely stunning! Don't need more than a couple hours visiting but definitely enough time to appreciate the history.
"The imperial city is a place I've always wanted to see ever since I was a university student. Unfortunately, the miserable weather dampened my experience a bit. The citadel incorporates a large area, most of which is original and beautiful to see. There is a lot of construction work going on in an effort to restore the city, so it may be a little noisy here and there."
"We visited citadel with our local guide who explained us a lot about the history of this city. The site offers excellent opportunity for photos and has a video where you can watch and learn more about the history if you haven't hired a guide.
I really liked the architecture and the gardens. Well kept archeological site that is worth a visit."
"Arrived at Hue on a sleeping bus that came from Ninh Binh early in the morning and headed down to this attraction, it was def worth it. But wouldn't spend more than a day in Hue"
"We chatted with an aide masterminded by our inn and it was well justified, despite all the trouble. His nearby learning clarified what the different structures were and their history. He was likewise ready to bring up the structures that are being restored because of war harm. Possibly not an entire day but rather an entrancing couple of hours"
"We spent half a day wandering around the citadel, this ancient capital. It is undergoing extensive renovation, as much of it was destroyed during the Vietnam war. In fact, the Viet Cong captured this citadel and occupied it. There's a lot of bullet holes in the walls. You can watch a digital recreation of the entire citadel as it existed in it's heyday. The presentation gives a good overview of the site. We watched artisans repairing paint and guilding and very much enjoyed a musical presentation by individuals in court costumes playing ancient instruments in one of the buildings that were open. There is also a very nice photographic display of previous royals and functions that occurred at the citadel."
"It was sad to see how much of the palace was destroyed during the war so much of it is in ruins/neglected. Restoration is being carried out as we speak but at a slow pace (corruption eating away funds).

We were very interested in Ancient Vietnamese history before we came to Hue, but once inside the Imperial Palace we were a bit underwhelmed after seeing the photographs of what it was actually like back in the days.

I just can't fathom the neglect through the ages but, there are hints of its beauty from the glory days in the ornate columns, wood work etc. I look forward to returning to Hue in 10 to 20 years time to see more restoration completed.

If you visit & not a history buff, grab a guide. You'll need at least 1-2 hours to stroll through."
"Honestly, this wasn't worth even the one day stop I had in Hue. In comparison to all the other things to see in Vietnam, this really shouldn't be on them...especially when Hoi An is so close and far prettier. Bit of a let down and kind of expensive - as vietnam goes."
This is a must see in Hue with a ' forbidden city' feel to it. It's mostly 19th century but has been historically poorly maintained and a lot is crumbling and peeling. It also suffered desperately in the French occupation and Vietnam/American war with most buildings destroyed. Now there is a new government initiative to restore the damaged buildings and completely rebuild many of those destroyed from the foundations up. They look glorious but are not quite history. But certainly go.
We visited the citadel just as it started to rain and the cold snap hir at the end of January so we couldn't do justice to this enormous complex and had to rush through. So much to see! Amazing buildings and history. Fascinating photographs in the Mandarin Halls showing life in the Citadel in the times of the emperors. Sad to think so much was destroyed in the war.
This place is stunning. Just walking the grounds was a peaceful experience for me. We still hired a guide to hear the more interesting tidbits of history. At 150k dong it was worth it.
We went there for a two and a half hour walk. It was nice and worth visiting if you are in Hue. The temples are impressive and I was most impressed by the shot up temple gate.
"The Citadel is a must at Hué. We spent a total of six hours wondering through the buildings and gardens inside the fortress. Very beautiful architecture; each time we thought we'd finished the visit, we'd find another beautiful spot at garden. It hosted the emperors of Vietnam between 1802-1945. A must, go with plenty of time to get enchanted with is beauty."
"I really don't know much about Vietnamese imperial history, this place does make you interested.
They are undertaking extensive rebuilding and renovation, however, I hope they don't over do it and leave some of the old buildings as well.
What a pleasant and interesting way to spend a few hours"
It only took me about an 1 to walk around the city but what I saw was amazing. The area itself was in good condition and the guides were knowable and informative. The koi fish at the ponds at the entrance were great fun to feed.
A little run down utility the citadel is well worth a couple of hours. Very large and a lot are ruins but we'll presented.
"It's a huge place, with many things to see. The buildings and architecture are amazing and its a nice walk, or you can get a free golf cart to take you around. Don't miss the sides as most do by walking straight through the middle and out the other end. Gift shops here are expensive, so be aware. Also make sure you feed the fish on the way in through the main gate. They are crazy, probably because they are starving, so give them a good meal. You take their food from the box and leave the small asked amount in the money box. Well worth it. Go here if you are in Hue! Also make sire you get the 3 in 1 ticket if you plan on visiting the two main tombs and the Imperial City while you are in Hue!"
Kind of reminds you of places like the Forbidden City in Beijing or any other number of old imperial palaces across Asia. A couple of hours is enough unless you are a real buff on this sort of stuff
"Wonderful experience but be prepared - it is a very large complex. Best way to get there is either by hiking across the bridges (but remember - the Old City is huge) or by taxis which are cheap by the meter. The 'dragon boats' are fine, but they dump you in the weeds and you have to walk through this to get to the entrance. Rickshaws are fine for the experience, but they cost more than the taxis and take forever. If you are over 80 kilos - it will hurt..."
This was the capital of vietnam in the 1800's until 1923. It is a great historical representation of older vietnam.
"It is best to go as soon as it opens as it gets very hot walking around amongst the city.
Well worth going to see.
Do not accept cyclo tours or people offering to show you the city.
They can only take you around the perimeter, and to actually see the city you need to pay an entrance fee at the front gate."
We were fortunate to have an excellent English speaking guide who gave us a wonderful narrative of the history of the Citadel from ancient times right up to the present. It is a large compound so give yourselves a full day or at a minimum a half a day to visit. We were there when the weather was cool and pleasant.
"This was pretty much the only reason I stopped of at Hue during my trip to Vietnam and I have to say I was a little disappointed.

I've been to the Forbidden City in Beijing a number of times and Hue's Citadel shares many similarities such as the same Chinese names for the gates, various palaces and it's sheer size.

However, unlike the Forbidden City, this place has been left to rot. I did not that some areas have been (or are being) renovated but most of it is in ruins. Of course, in some ways, this can make the place more interesting but there's no commentary or write ups in English to explain the different buildings.

Nevertheless, I did spend a few hours wandering around and I did learn a few things so I'd still recommend a visit."
Historic and large. A great deal of history not to be missed. Get a guide and plan to spend a half day wandering this amazing place for kings.
"This visit will take you several hours to do it justice. We were there on a cold rainy day, speeding our way though it and could have spent more time had the weather been nicer. It is a full restoration job that is on-going. The displays and descriptions range from very good to needs improvement. The cost is 150,000 VD or about $7.50 USD - well worth the price."
The amount of work undertaken since our last visit in 2014 has made this visit even more of an experience. There is much more English added to the signage which is very helpful. Tasteful shopping opportunities have been allowed around the site.
"Visit the imperial city and its surrounding area by bike, hire a tour for an hour and you'll receive some interesting history about the people who lived here. The gardens are expanse and it'll take you all day to walk around the imperial gardens. It's a must if your visiting Hue."
"the flag tower, nine canons, watch tower, thai hoa palace, dynastic urns, the library...all these and many more make the Hue citadel a journey into the royal history of Vietnam. a half day tour is needed to explore this place at peace."
"As many people have pointed out, entry into the Imperial city is quite expensive at 150,000 dong, but this also includes entry to the Arts Museum (across the road from the exit), and we spent at least two hours here, and if it hadn't been so cold and wet we probably would have spent longer.

Of the original 40+ buildings that once stood here only 5 now remain, though the whole site is slowly and very carefully being restored. There are a number of interesting exhibitions; the one detailing life in the Imperial City was particularly fascinating. There are also gardens, temples and a theatre to explore as well as the palace buildings and the main Noon Gate.

If you don't want to pay the entrance fee, we enjoyed the walk around the Imperial City walls which you can do without actually entering, but you can still see the (outside) gates."
The tour of this historical site was interesting. We had an excellent guide who explained the history and the current rebuilding that was underway.
"Visited the Hue Imperial City yesterday and I wasn't disappointed. It is very interesting, supported by loads of ancient pictures/texts/official letters that help you understand the History behind it all. Couldn't see it all (it's so big there) but overall I liked the experience. Great photo opportunities :)"
"It cost 150k Dong to get in, but it was one of the most beautiful places we´ve seen this far in Vietnam. We even bought a painting inside which we can´t wait to get up on the wall!

I recommend going there when you come to Hue, just to experience for yourself how the people lived and see the majestic architecture."
"My wife and I visited the Hue Citadel on a rainy Monday in mid-January. We visited as part of a tour of the city of Hue with ""Tour From Hue - Day Tours"" (see separate review - our tour included the Pagoda, the Tombs, and the Hue Citadel).

The Hue Citadel is a complex of Vietnamese Imperial buildings built largely in the 1800s. The buildings were modeled on Beijing's Forbidden City. If you've been there, the Hue Citadel is about 1/4 the size. We would suggest allowing 1-2 hours here - although people with a significant interest in Vietnamese history or photographers looking for atmospheric visuals could probably enjoy a longer visit.

Be aware that a visit here includes a fair amount of walking - probably your recommended 10,0000 steps per day. And, as with just about every other historical site in Vietnam, there are stairs involved (nothing too strenuous, but people with mobility issues should be aware before visiting)."
"Read the title, 150,000vd to get in, filled to the brim with tourists, avoid if you want a genuine personal experience or prepare to watch a load of mindless photograph taking cattle go crazy for nothing"
The Citadel is a great visit but make sure you allow yourself enough time to see it all. All kings live in luxuriant surroundings and the Vietnamese Kings were no different. The history is amazing even the retained bullet holes on the walls at the entrance held over and preserved from the February 1968 Tet Offensive. Don't forget to feed the goldfish at the entrance pool....they appreciate the gesture.
"walked along the Perfume River from town centre to the citadel, in overcast skies. Upon arrival the drizzling rain set in but nothing could dampen the experience of the royal palace and grounds and the amazing restorations being done in the traditional way to replicate what has been destroyed by wars and time. As Molly Meldrum once said "" Australia do yourself a favour"" put this one on must see list!"
"If you have limited time in Hue (we only had one day), then this is the place to visit and spend your time. This used to be the imperial center of Vietnam up until 1940s and has been mostly devastated during the Vietnam wars, therefore only a few of the original buildings remain: of the c.40 buildings in the ""Forbidden City"" where the emperor and the immediate family lived, only 5 original remain. There is a lot of gradual restoration (may be called ""rebuilding"") going on based on the original layout and designs. There is a good exhibition inside that explains the royal life, imperial governance and the society during imperial times, as well as a good short movie explaining its history being shown in the royal throne hall. There are some nice ponds and gardens further behind with very good photo opportunities."
"We went there ten years ago and find out the place has improved immensely. Our tour bus stopped at the bus station and we had to walk about five minutes to the Citadel. This was one place included in the city tour. I wish we had done by ourself since the tour guide was not polished with manners as he rushed us through the tour. However I really enjoyed to walk around the Citdel, the museum, the Royal Garden...my wife loved to feed the koi in one of the beautiful ponds. You have to plan plenty of times to visit this site."
"Similar to the Forbidden City, a lot smaller scale. One of the top recommended attractions in Hue.
There's a cafe nearby Rods Cafe before entering the Citadel that offers free use of bathroom if purchasing food or drinks, otherwise you have to pay to use bathroom facility.
Just make sure you bring your own toilet paper."
"This is Hue's prime attraction consisting of a great complex of temples,pavillions, shops, museums protected by walls, gates and moats. Building was started in 1804 using thousands of workers. It continued as the seat of government until 1946. Regrettably it was severly damaged in January 1968 during the Tet offensive. Much restoration work is being undertaken now. Well worth having a guided tour. There is a lot to take in."
"Not the best unisco world heritage site. Make sure you bring a raincoat if it's raining, lots of open areas. Not curated that well and feels fake in many parts. Interesting history but not preserved well."
Very interesting place to visit with gives you a nice impression of the last dynasty of Vietnam before power was handed over to the communist party. If you are interested in history I highly recommend to visit this place on your own and not by tour. There is much to read and the place is incredible huge. Not possible to see with a organized tour which rushes you trough.
"I expected the Citadel to be in worse condition than it was. (It was 70% destroyed during the 'American War', but is being lovingly and gradually restored). It is clearly modelled on the Forbidden City, but its smaller size makes it much easier to visit. We had a couple of hours here as part of a package tour, however we could easily have spent longer. If you're in Hue and can take the time - and you're interested in history, this is well worth a visit."
"Why only a four rating when it's a must visit, still a lot of restoration going on and to be continued. Beyond the restoration still needed, the history of Vietnam lies inside this citadel. If you want to learn about Vietnam and how it has arrived to this point today, then hire yourself a guide who is knowledgeable in its history and take the tour. Our guide was fantastic, he explained for the first emperor to the thirteenth and to present times the history of Vietnam."
"We only had limited time in Hue and The Citadel was left until the end of our transfer & tour day with only a few hours to look around...could have easily been 3/4 to a full day stay. Very interesting place and would like to go back one day to see more. Ideally our schedule would have allowed for 2 nights in Hue, but we only had one.. so much to do and see."
It's a beautiful place and a beautiful experience to walk around this ancient citadel. We spent most of the afternoon exploring. We didn't need a guide but just did our own thing.
This Unesco Heritage site is well deserved. The place is s beautiful display of Vietnamese architecture of the time.
"This attraction covers a very large area, after first gate you come across a huge moat, then you enter second gate. There is a large courtyard so the king could overlook his army and give speeches, stairs are not proportion to normal people, very high."
"We visited with a guide arranged by our hotel and it was well worth it. His local knowledge explained what the various buildings were and their history.

He was also able to point out the buildings that are being restored due to war damage.

Maybe not a full day but a fascinating few hours"
"This is great site to visit if you want to know about the past life of royal family. Although most of them were destroyed, but still alot to see. Highly recommend you!"
We were unsure what to except in Hue and our hotel recommend this place. We were blown away by its size and grandeur. It was beautiful and extremely peaceful to be in these grounds. It made the trip to Hue worth while as I'm not sure there was much more there to offer.
"The palace was built under the influence of the Chinese Forbidden City. While, people that have visited the grand palace in Beijing would admit the difference, in scale, in quality and in beauty. Nevertheless, it is worth visiting. It sits like an old man, telling you the old stories in a silent way. Do have a good guide."
"Peaceful stroll through the old city, if you are in hue definitely worth visiting HOWEVER not worth an out of the way trip"
"Interesting visit and buildings. Definitively worth a visit.
The interpretation found in the various buildings gives a good background knowledge."
"It is a large area so take your time and wander. There is a lot of work going on here to renovate all the damage done by the Tet offensive. However, it is well worth the visit and you should also go to the Museum of Antiquities."
"The citadel was old and some of its building has been destroyed during the war, but it was quite a good place to visit in Hue for people to explore the ancient capital city of vietnam."
"The buildings are amazing, the whole site is amazing. Get a guide book or join one of the tours. This is ancient Vietnam at its' very, very best."
"I visited the citadel with a tour group and was amazed. The history and architecture made for some serious visual pleasure as well as a great lesson on the Vietnam past. There is a video to watch at the kings thrown, English descriptions are common, and you can grab a coffee or tourist gift while inside. It's a must do if in Hue."
"The best thing to do if you have two days in Hue is to get this full pass for the Citadel, the three tombs and the pagoda. The Citadel is constantly being renovated but there are no closed sections you can walk around for a half day before you've seen all of it. I suggest packing a lunch or snacks and take your time because you'll be walking a lot this place is big but totally worth it. Lots to read if your a history buff."
Beautiful buildings and gardens all reconstructed after being destroyed in the American War. Mu h of this reconstruction work is continuing. Unfortunately it was raining the day we visited but a must see for anyone visiting Hue.
"The Imperial City is quite beautiful. Some parts have come out of the wars unscathed, and you can see the original craftsmanship. The many parts being restored are being done tastefully, with full attention to detail, without being intrusive. Photos give interesting historic perspectives for non-Vietnamese speaking."
"When visiting Hue you must visit the Citadel, this is where you will learn the history of Hue and it's royalty. There is restoration taking place as there was a lot of damage during the war, some has been restored and quite a lot being done still. We took a number of photos and found this place very interesting as we did not know the history until visiting and taking it all in, worth a visit if you are in the area."
You pay 150.000d as entrance fee. The building is on the outside quite imposant but as from the inside you'll see construction works.
"Stunning walks inside and outside the citadel walls - very relaxing. In light of the severity of war damage sustained, don't expect all buildings to be restored (far from it)... but more than enough buildings to justify an enjoyable trip are restored, and plenty of information is displayed for those interested in a light history lesson."
"Huge expanse of mainly outside gardens that are quite lovely as you get closer to the rear of the palace. We tried to find a guide but not offered which was disappointing, however there is a seated area where a video loop can show you some of the history of the palace. Lots of walking involved in getting to the palace but the exercise is always useful. If it's hot, make sure to take water, sunscreen and hats."
"This site probably won't bring you to your knees like the Parthenon, but it is interesting, enlightening a a must do. We didn't spend enough time to give a full report, but so glad we went. Pearl S. Buck had it just right."
"An interesting place to visit as it provides you with some of the history of Hue. Inside the Citadel is the Imperial City, with the Forbidden City inside that (this is much smaller than the Forbidden City in Beijing). Our tour guide provided a lot of interesting information during our tour, and I enjoyed my visit here. Restoration is taking place but it was great to walk around the buildings, read about the history of the royal family in one of the rooms, and enjoy the lovely grounds. It was definitely worth the visit."
"My husband and I spent an entire day strolling around the grounds here. There are great photo opportunities and it's a giant complex so it's easy to avoid the crowds. The site is beautiful and it is a great time to see it. Renovation has been going on so you are able to see both the original, old, structures and the newly renovated ones that show you how the area looked a long time ago."
"Huge site, in the process of massive restoration. Gives a fascinating glimpse of the old order that existed before the French colonial period and the tragic war with America. The site was all but destroyed in the American War when US troops recaptured the city. The destruction is still visible and provides a moving backdrop to the restoration work."
"It was really a nice place for any people who care about the ancient architecture or history. General picture was a place with similar architecture with forbidden city or great walls in China but there were actually totally different. Every details architecture was very special. Its special from the materials to the way they create it.
Totally agree with other ideas about the tour guide. You will need a good tour guide for this places because every palace going with stories and it makes it become so special."
"Destroyed, with only basic maintanance. They gave us an explanation, that it has been destroyed by US air force during a war. Probably it's true, but I doubt that Americans deliberately planted grass in the gutters of the Citadel."
This was part of our tour and the guide made it! Suggest you find a guide to take you through it could be boring
"Much is being restored, but it is easy to find bullet holes and bomb craters. Regardless, it is a place to see. We took a Dragon Boat to get there. A fun ride under many of the bridges."
"Again a place as so many other similar places in Vietnam. If you are interested in former history you should visit it... for me at this moment I had enough of stones, bricks and temples ;-)"
"Very large and fun to walk around. Some beautiful buildings and we'll kept grounds. I'm already suffering from palace fatigue, but I still thought this was a great way to spend an afternoon."
"NOTE: when there, try to see the performance of music and dance given in one of the palaces. Our guide knew about it and made sure we were there for the 10 AM performance. There was another one at 3 PM, only twice daily. These are traditional pieces performed at the Imperial Court, interesting and fun. The Imperial City was largely destroyed by American bombardment but what was left has been lovingly maintained and restored, and reconstruction is ongoing. The Chinese influence is obvious (think Forbidden City) but the Vietnamese interpretation is interesting. It is worth spending the time to see the whole complex."
Nice imperial city center! A lot of the buildings are gone but the ones that remain are cool. A must see if you are stopping in Hue!
The citadel is huge and most of it is under reconstruction. But there is still a lot of original features left. Bring a guide to get all of the history within the walls.
"We had an afternoon visit and the use of the sites buggies was welcome in the very hot weather.
The buildings are well preserved and very interesting."
"The new restored building are very nice, but most of it is just a ruin. All the buildings are very badly maintained and most of them missing. They have even managed to hang pictures on the wall crooked.

Our tour guide decided to take our tickets and do a runner, not even bothering to show us around and there aren't many signs to read so couldn't take in most of the history. Would recommend but get good tour guide."
A visit to this place is a must when you're in Hue. You'll be impressed with its detailed architecture. It was a good thing that we wore comfy shoes because the place is so huge. I suggest you do your research before going. A guide would help too. It's amazing how they were able to built such city back then.
"Expensive to enter at 150k dong per person just to look at refurbished, restructured architecture. The place is huge but not much of picture taking opportunity... Should hv just given this a miss."
"Visit the imperial city and its surrounding area by bike, hire a tour for an hour and you'll receive some interesting history about the people who lived here.
The gardens are expanse and it'll take you all day to walk around the imperial gardens.
It's a must if your visiting Hue."
"An imposing site full of fascinating restored buildings, buildings under renovation and the scattered rubble of once ornate pagodas, it is strange to wander on to the ground where the now destroyed Forbidden City used to stand and where your very presence in the time of the Emperors could have resulted in decapitation. The Royal Theatre has a lovely collection of costumes and the Halls of the Mandarins has a very interesting exhibition of old photographs."
The Imperial city is a very impressive attraction and architectural masterpiece. The area is huge so make sure to wear comfy shoes. It is a must-see when in Hue and overall a impressive cultural experience.
"This place is a must do if you're stayung in Hue for a day.
If you want to see the tombs as well, make sure you get the ticket pack from Citadel, as you would save around 100,000 vnd.
We spent more than 4 hours in the citadel, and still missed some parts of it.
The architecture and history is amazing. Just make sure you read about it before or you get a guide cause you need the story behind every building, otherwise you might get bored.
Anither suggestion is to have some snacks with you, or go there after breakfast/ lunch, cause there's nit that much to buy inside, and everything is overpriced."
"The imperial city is huge and visiting its buildings are a fun and interesting way to learn about the vietnamese dynasty that reigned not so long ago. Its architectural mix of both old and new grabs the attention of old and young alike and is highly recommended. I also suggest watching the video next to the throne hall building, it provides nice info on the structure and use of the imperial city."
It was ok less than I expected but still a must see. It is under construction now but the sites are still open. You can spend a whole day out here. But one citedal is the same as the next.
"The Citadel began construction in 1802 by the Nguyen dynasty and took 30 years to build. It essentially was the entire town of Hue at that time, with the normal people inside the outer walls, the government inside an inner citadel, and an exclusive central citadel for the royal family. Much of it was destroyed during the war.

There are all sorts of buildings, from residences to the treasury to temples to the royal library to the building where they taught arts and music.

It helped us a lot to have our intrepid guide with us. I don't know how much we would have gotten out of it without a guide.

At the entrance is a pond where you can feed the fish which the kids loved.

The site is large - there is a lot of walking to get around. We did see some golf buggy things that some people were using."
"You'll need a few hours to really enjoy this site. It's a huge complex built in the 1800s. It has a 6 mile perimeter wall surrounded by a moat & modelled after the Forbidden City in Bejing. Inside you'll find the Dien Tho Palace, Thai Hoa Palace, Hall of Mandarins and the original Nine Dynastic Urns. There are fabulous walking areas around the gardens. There're plenty of information boards explaining the Ngu Yen Dynasty that ruled from 1804 - 1945."
You could spend a long time here - lots to see. You get best value to do this with a guide. Lots of walking here plus live traditional music and dancers.
"This is a fantastic attraction where you can get a good sense of the Imperial palace and how the king and queen lived with their outrage in the imperial city. Very arty and extensive. Most places have been renovated in its former glory but towards the back of the imperial city you still see the destruction brought about by the war.

Make sure you have a tour guide or a narrator to provide explanation and a bit of history while you stroll through the city.

You can purchase water and drinks at specific locations. But I carried my own bottle of water and recommend the same.
Make sure you take a camera. There are some areas where you can't take pictures but you can capture most of the location and it's grandeur"
A fascinating and beautiful place which needs time to explore properly. Much quieter than other heritage sites.
Walk in the footsteps of past kings of Viet Nam. . .feel the vibes of the center of fighting during the Tet Offensive back in the 60s. . .strolls the surrounding neighborhoods to feel the presence of so many ghosts from all the past conflict. . .soak up the peaceful vitality that pervades here today. Hoa binh.
"This is a must stop in any travel to Vietnam. Bring your camera a get lost is this gorgeous city! Although you could get through the city in 2-3 hours, you could easily spend half day. Halfway through your journey stop for some wonderful teas at the royal tea house!"
Fascinating insight into the last dynasty. The complex is extensive and the restoration work done to date is impressive. There is a large amount of information about various aspects of the dynasty. There were also live performances of traditional music. Allow 2 hours to explore thoroughly.
I would describe it as a cheap replica if I compare it to the Forbidden City of Beijing. Not worth visiting if you have seen the original..
"This was my favorite site to visit in Vietnam. If you go early in the morning, it's empty, quiet, and cool. We spent around 3 hours taking great pictures, reading through the exhibitions, and looking at the temples and gardens. A must-see in my view."
"its a long trek, although best done with a tour as most of it is in Vietnamese, Looks of stuff to see though"
I couldnt imagine how massive this was until i stepped inside and started researching. With all pictures on walls telling you story you can quickly jump into those times with your imagination. Place is very clean with plenty of places for refreshment. Fee is a bit expensive but since they are constantly renewing a place keeping it up for next generations its worth it.
"My partner and I are very keen on learning the local history of where ever we travel and so were looking forward to visting the Imperial City to soak up some of the history and unfortunately we were a little disappointed.

There was very little information out and about the place, informing you if what once stood there, compared to what you could see now. Granted you could book a personal tour which I assume would have given you more information, but should you wish to wonder the grounds yourself, you should be able to do so and know what you're looking at.

Also, we read that some if the buildings were being restored and so we were looking forward to seeing how the projects had progressed, but again no detail on this, no before and after shots, nothing. In fact the buildings hadn't been restored but had been completely demolished and rebuilt using modern materials....disappointing.

It cost 100,000 vnd entry each, but if you're planning on visiting other attractions you can buy a multi pass which is valid for 2 days and allows you access to 2 or 3 attractions so goo value for money."
"It was very interesting, however a nap needs to be provided to know where to go as so much is being reconstructed and repaired after the French war and the grounds are so expansive. I would wait a few years till correlates are made before visiting."
"Learning about the history of the Citadel was a great experience. We spent a few hours wandering through the city and came across many great photo opportunities. The city has been attacked several times and many of the remnants have been turned to rubble or are burned. The structures are still something unique to behold and the architecture is amazing. There are quite a few areas that are under construction so you are not allowed to view them. My favorite part was the waterways throughout the city. There are many shops to buy souvenirs but I found them overpriced and a bit tacky since it costs $120,000/person to enter The Citadel. However, it is one of the truly unique parts of Hue and is a must if you are touring the city for sights."
Amazed at the size of the Imperial City. Good to see how much renovation is being carried out. Lots of garden areas. Truly impressive architecture. Put aside half a day for a proper tour to get the most out of your visit and definitely have a local guide.
"The Vietnamese are doing a great job at renovating the imperial city, it was clearly heavily damaged previously.
We had our Lonely Planet guide with us, which was invaluable in providing a layout of the area and an explanation of what we were looking at.
Definitely worth a visit, probably the highlight of Hue."
"Actually Hué is all about coming to visit the Imperial City. Although it's hard to avoid rain (it's pooring here all year round thanks to the enclosed location between mountains) and if you are lucky you have some dry periods during your visit. The imperial city is about the only serious palace complex you can visit in Vietnam. In size is tiny compared to examples in Thailand (Ayutthaya), Cambodia (Siem Reap) and Myanmar (Bagan). And it dates from a quite recent era (building started in 8014). As it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site it is now being renovated but I think it's quite questionable if this is done in a good way."
"We hired a guide on our arrival at the citadel for 150,000 dong for an hour at the office right next to the entrance and it was definitely worth it. In hindsight we probably should have booked for longer as without our guide the citadel would not have been half as interesting and when she left us we still had quite a lot to see. There was so much history behind each picture/artefact.

We went in Dec and it was overcast so it wasn't too hot, but if you are going on a sunny day make sure you have water and a hat/umbrella to shade yourself from the sun as you will be exposed to the elements for a large portion of your time there.

Overall this was an interesting couple of hours and it's worth taking a look if you're in Hue"
Our tour guide made the walk about the Citadel come alive. I would have been lost without his guidance. Thong was able to relate the history of the Vietnamese culture and the influence of other countries on their style of cuisine and architecture.
We visited here on the afternoon of 12th January and were amazed at how vast the city was and how much there is to see. We would recommend at least 3-4 hour visit to enjoy this fantastic place.
"It has many similarities to the FC but whilst both are wonderful I preferred this lovely place. There were plenty of gardens that just begged for a picnic basket, blanket and a good book. You need minimum of 3 hours but pref half a day. If you intend to spend a few days in Hue you can do worse than spend a peaceful afternoon in one of the gardens. Most people don't walk off the main path ways. Absolute must."
"We spent two hours walking around The citadel and were impressed with the buildings and grounds. Camera drones are starting to be used by tourists, so it might be a lot noisier (and dangerous!) pretty soon!"
Grounds are in varying degrees of repair or replacement. English speakers really need a guided tour. Some magnificent areas. Boiling oil pot interesting.
"The vast old imperial citadel in the centre of Hue is slowly being restored to its former glory after it suffered massive destruction during the Vietnam war. The palace, Tu Mieu temple complex, Emperor's reading room and Dien Tho residence have all been sensitively restored but it's also interesting to see the still ruined parts of the citadel. There a few relaxing places to grab a drink and a bite to eat on the way round so you can (and should) take your time to make sure you see everything. The entrance ticket includes entry into the nearby museum, which contains various interesting artifacts from the citadel, which shouldn't be missed. Not listed on Trip Advisor, I'll give a special mention here to the friendly Hong Mai restaurant on the corner of Dinh Tien Hoang and Nguyen Bieu, a ten minute stroll from the museum, which serves incredibly cheap and good quality food."
Totally enjoyed walking around the Citadel with our private tour guide. There's so much history and wonderful that they are taking the time to reconstruct what was destroyed.
It was interesting to see Vietnamese history. I think more information on the history of the site not just the emperors who lived there. There is so much more recent history which would have given visitors a true sense of what has previously taken place and the struggles of the people of Hue.
"This place gives you a glimpse of historical Vietnam and its empire. Most of the buildings are severally damaged and unfortunately loses some of the luster. However, good way to spend an hour or so to visit."
"We really our tour around the citadel on what was probably the hottest day of our trip. Steeped in history, and well explained by our guide.
Having read about the Tet Offensive and the battle for Hue the night before, some of the things seen (and not seen - because they are not there any more) bring home some of the things this country has been through.

Very peaceful too - some nice places to sit, pause, contemplate, catch your breath. Put on the ""must-see"" list for Hue."
"The Citadel represents the old era of Vietnam. So, it is good to visit to experience a better Vietnam. The way to this place is okay, but there were quite many vehicles such as motorcycles and cars. Overall, it is worth visiting."
"The Imperial Citadel is a complex of a number of building, landscaped areas a ponds. Its large and you will probably get more out of it with a guide in terms of understanding what you are looking at, but its not like you will get lost or into any trouble without one. take the time to feed the fish. fishfood is for sale cheaply and they are quite spectacular."
Amazing Spot ... full of history. Entrance fee is okay. Loved to look around and see all the nice places in there. Just go there early in the morning to avoid standing in lane and enjoy the quietness.
"I was highly impressed by this place. I admire the effort done and ongoing works for the conservation of this UNESCO site. Go in the morning, so that you can enjoy the peaceful and magic ambiente! And actually it's quite easy to visit it without guide, they are enough information provided!"
Visitors need to choose between spending a couple hours or a full day here. There is much to see and time should be budgeted based on interest in details. Having a guide is a big plus. I look forward to visiting again after more restorations have been made.
Hue's main attraction and well worth the visit. You'll get most out of it if you hire a local guide like Mr Pheong at EasyRiderPro.com - we combined it with a boat trip to the pagoda and it made the perfect half day out.
It has many beautiful buildings (I especially liked the royal library) but it's better to be there with a guide to learn something about the place's history. We've also seen two different traditional music groups playing there.
I was expecting a lot of old Indo china here and was a little disappointed. Apart from the citadel the rest of Hue was quite modern and bland. There was a lot of fighting during the Vietnam War here and I would have thought there would be more about it. I've ticked the box and been there so moving on.
We love all things history so we enjoyed it thoroughly! Although there is a lot of reconstruction work it was still a very enjoyable day
"Unfortunately much of the citadel was destroyed during the war (in 1968) so many of the building are just foundations, restoration is underway, though some of that is already looking worse for wear"
The place is huge – Take time to go into smaller temples and have fun exploring away from the masses. Some of the detailing on the buildings is simply amazing.
A must see if in Hue. Amazing stories behind those extremely detailed buildings and decors. Unfortunately not all buildings are still there (bombed during the vietnam war and other reasons). it is a 3 hour max visit i would say.
"Impressive palace with beautiful gardens and ponds. If you don't go with a guide, you won't find a lot of information on site and it can easily become a bit boring with no context to place the buildings into. Next time, we'd go with a guide!"
The Citadel is a huge complex. Just walking around the place took a couple hours. The history is fascinating!
"So impressive with the history ,you will need large hours to walk and see a large city.bring your own water And comfortable shoes."
"We enjoyed wandering around The Citadel, its huge! But the buildings are beautiful and its just interesting to see. Definitely recommend."
Peaceful place to walk around. A couple of nice spots to stop and have a cold drink. Took us around 3 hours which included a short break.
Fascinating ancient city a lot of history. Can be a long tour to three hours at least. Well worth the visit. Amazing temples and beautiful artwork
"We spent a good part of the day exploring the city, rich in history and partly destroyed by war it was very interesting and I would highly recommend it. As a westerner don't forget to take your own toilet paper as with most of the places we have visited, there is none supplied."
"At one point in time (circa 1828), this was a fabulous place, the repository for every part of life that was the last ruling family. All the concubines,the royal library, the treasury, throne room and so on. Over time this was abandoned for better climes but the Tet offensive really put paid to the glorious gates. One gets an idea of what could have been, had life gone differently."
We spent a day in Hue visiting the Citadel and Tombs. The history and the culture was fasinating. Our guide Anna who worked for UNESCO was excellent and spoke good english. We also did a boat trip on the Perfume River and although the weather wasn't great it was good fun. Good day out!
"I thought it was much bigger but when we were there I wished it was smaller :) Many places to see, many things to learn."
"We were on a private tour with guide and it was really great to hear all of the history of this site. We were taken to the most interesting sections and thoroughly enjoyed this complex. You can buy an entry ticket for 2 days for 5 sights (citadel, to duc tomb, thien mu pagoda, Minh mang tomb, khai dinh tomb) for 360,000 VND."
"Definitely make time in your Vietnam itinerary to see the Citadel. It's wonderful for a relaxing and quiet walk, if nothing else! 1 day in Hue will allow you to see the Citadel though perhaps not Perfume River as well as tours for the latter leave early and return mid-late PM."
"This was the place I was most looking forwardto visiting..
The citadel was expensive there was a separate price for locals and tourists. The Citadel was basically a large ruin spread over a large area partially restored and with limited information
It was really disappointing"
"Nice from outside, boring from inside...waste of my time. Take some picture of bullet holes in the walls, feed the Koi fish at the entrance... then probably just leave."
"Like so many buildings it's a constant theme that they need work, this was no exception. There is work going on but I think maybe the craftsmen are in short supply. Hue must have been such a beautiful city. This is where the final King abdicated."
It was really pleasant walking around the imperial city. It was well maintained and it takes you back in time.
"The Citadel is so very beautiful including the magnificent gardens and has such history attached to its surroundings.
However it is very important to go with a guide as there so much that should be explained about the whole area.."
"A massive area worth seeing at least once in your lifetime, & will only get better. This place will be magnificent once it has been fully restored which will take another 20-30 years."
The citadel complex is like a mini-forbidden city in Beijing but unfortunately much of the buildings have been destroyed. What is there and what is being restored is both interesting and the location is a must see in Hue given its historical significance. A good guide is essential to explain the Nguyen dynasty and all of the important locations.
"You can spend nearly a full day, considering all that need to be seen. Lots of the temples and monuments have been rebuilt in an authentic way."
Restoration of famous sights is a tricky art. If it looks and feels new (because it is totally rebuilt) it looses some of it's original charm.This has happened to the Citadel i Hué.
"Modelled on Beijing's Forbidden City this is a great place to visit. Whilst you can wander independently, our guide provided a great deal of explanation and background history which enhanced our experience and enjoyment. Recognised by UNESCO in 1995 it is still undergoing much restoration. That said there is still plenty to see and great photographs to capture. Consider purchasing a combination ticket if you are visiting other sites (VND280k for 3 or VND360 for 4).
Thanks for the vote if you found this helpful."
"This would have been amazing in its time. It is much larger that I realised, the grounds were enormous, the architecture was beautiful. We were there for a few hours but you could spend a lot longer there strolling the grounds.
Interesting for the whole family, but having a guide helps you get a better understanding of the complex."
"Hue is built around the citadel. The size of its campus and intricacy of each building make for an awe-inspiring observation. You can also notice and appreciate the effort gone into preserving this group of monuments that's nearly 200 years old.

I felt transported back in time as if I was walking to meet the Emperor and his mother. My heart wrenched every time I came upon ruins and read a sign that said 'this building was destroyed during the war'. Definitely a must-visit not just for travelers to Hue, but anyone stepping into Vietnam."
Arrive early to have uncluttered vistas. Renovations are still taking place and some places are really just ruins but this is a fantastic site.
We visited the Hue Imperial City with our guide who gave us a lot of background information on the city and history of the Vietnamese imperial families. It may be difficult to appreciate it fully without a guide.The site is under continuing restoration and it will be great to visit it again in a few years' time after the restoration work has been completed. This is a must see in Hue.
If you are in Hue then this is one of the attractions that has to be visited. It citadel is largely.well restored and further restoration is in progress. It offers great insight into Vietnam history.
Wonderful experience and very interesting. It was great to see the depth of the walls and how the city defended itself against mauraders.
It was a very big campus so make sure you give yourself plenty of time to enjoy the sights. Don't get lost!
"Quite massive and worth having a guide to learn the lore as well as the history.
The restoration of tile decorations on the stone is priceless.
Give yourself 2 hrs or more."
This is a definite must see when in Hue. The place is huge so give your self at least 2hrs. Could spend half a day here. Really good to see there is restoration happening. Take a guide book or guide when you go.
Wonderful place to visit in Hué. If you come here it is a must. It's quite big and you need time. If you do it with the city tour you might not have enough time to take pictures. I would advice doing this alone. It cost 150.000 dong per person. It is worth it.
"Most of it was destroyed during war but retaliation and rebuilding is going on.
Interesting and worth a visit."
"A combined ticket to The Citadel and three mausoleums is 360,000 dong (about 11 pounds). Make sure you take a good guidebook or, at least, study the floor plan as it is easy to not realise what you should be looking at/for. The signage is not extensive, although there is a great exhibition on the Nguyen Dynasty and life at Court. Wear comfortable shoes and be careful of uneven flooring. Allow at least two hours for your visit (we were there for almost four). If in Hue, do make sure you go to this historic and inspiring site. It is amazing!"
"Avoid the dragon boats, cyclos and rickshaws and spend half a day walking around this UNESCO World Heritage Site. You'll be glad you did!"
Definitely a must see when in Hué. An important part of pre american Vietnamese war. However most of it is being rebuilt and also there is a general lack of background explanation(like the relationship to France). And of course the lonely Planet map to the citadel is mostly useless since it is changing all the time.
If you have a day to see Hue - this spot is the place to visit. Ancient walls are great and garden is large - find a tree for some shade to cool down.
"Very cool place definitely worth a visit if in the area. We easily spent a few hours here. Go in the morning to avoid crowds but still expect a fairly large amount of tourists. Lots of information around on signs and you can easily do this site without a guide as there is a video for free which explains much of the site.

Do be prepared to walk a fair amount we easily a walked 5 kilometers just around the compond.

Plenty of snacks for sale all at higher tourist price of course.

A couple of museums near by.

We found ticket prices pretty high as we got the 4 site pass which also gives acess to the three emperors tombs in the hue area which you will need to either taxi or get a driver to see as they are pretty spread out. 360k vnd gers an adult a 4 site ticket abd saves a bit, we vusitef all 4 sites over 2 days as tickets are valid for 2 days after the day of purchase. Tombs are worth seeing but you may want to have a break between them and the imperial city as you can get a bit over looking at buildings.

Lots of toilets in the area and they are clean and modern"
"Smaller then in Beijing, China, much more run down, but with nice decoration on the restored buildings. In the future it will be probably one of the most visited historic sight in the world. Worth to visit it."
Some parts renovated and others in the process. This is a big site to walk round with many different rooms and exhibitions to intrigue you. I loved the old photographs from the 19th century. Great for photographers!
We toured much of Hue via motorbike and it was a great experience. Could have spent countless hours wandering the Citadel looking at the architecture and taking in the rich history of the place. You will not be prepared for how large the place really is. Go with plenty of time left in the day. Because the area is so big it does not get crowded. There are shuttles offered to transport people but we walked the whole lot just fine.
"This is the highlight of Hue, a must see it has everything. It was designed after the Forbidden City in Beijing so it is very expansive, with lots to see, take a good part of a day to see it all."
The Imperial Disclosure is definitely worth seeing with a guide for about 1.5 bours. We stopped here on our way to Hoi An. The site is slowly being brought back to its original glory with the main gate beautifully restored. Make sure to watch a short video animation showing how the area looked like.
We had an excellent guide who made everything more interesting. We were there on a beautiful day. It can take as much time as you want to give it.
"The local con artists will offer to rickshaw you around this ancient complex, explaining that it will take five hours to traverse the ruins... Um, no. An hour and a half max is all you need to walk around the citadel yourself. This is the highlight of Hue and a must do if you visit the city. Snap happy times ensured."
"Obviously, the Imperial City/Citaldel is the reason no 1 to visit Hue. I think I read this quote on wikipedia, by a US commander after the battle in 1968: ""Did we have to destroy the town in order to save it?"" Keep that in mind when you go. A lot has been reconstructed since then, but there is still a lot to do. Really impressive, educating and sad. As many sights in Vietnam, onsite information could be much better and in the end, when I could not exit thru the main gate and was forced to go to the correct exit gate (?) I was wondering why they promote the golf carts for free use - and there are plenty of them standing around with sleeping drivers - but though asking politely refused it? Just a detail, but be prepared for some miles walking."
Ambling along ths heritage site was a very relaxing experience. keep two hours for this and enter via the Noon gate
It has nice scenery although some have been destroyed by the French and the Americans but there is restoration! Phew! Best
"19th century star fort with 10km2 walls with gardens,temples, palaces and other associated buildings. Heavily bombed during the Vietnam war, efforts are being made (most evidently by ODA) to restore parts of it to its former glory- or at least aprtially. We did go on a particularly miserable day, but it is an impressive structure that appears to not have the required funding and attention that would make it a truly great draw card for the city."
"Unfortunately big part of the Imperial City was distroied by the wars (French / USA), but it still worth to visit it."
"The Imperial City is so large that to do it justice the visitor needs a couple of hours at least. It is gradually being renovated and some parts rebuilt in the original style, so exhibits and buildings will add further interest in the future. A very interesting exhibition explaining the history of the Nguyen Dynasty is worth spending time on. The black and white photographs of a different era were fascinating. Definitely worth a visit!"
"We visited the Citadel just yesterday. Spent about 3-4 hours there....it's truly magical.
Right from the majestic entrance gates it's fabulous.
Take time to sit and watch the video presentation which is playing as soon as you enter the main hall..it's very well done and informative....it's at one end of the same room where there is a miniature model of the entire citadel.
This entire complex is huge and every area from the Royal Library to Royal Theatre and the few still standing living quarters are fabulous....the gardens are well manicured and landscaped....such a pleasure to see such vast green spaces inside a busy city!!
The government is making great efforts to restore damaged structures with superb results.....truly worth being named a UNESCO World Heritage site.
We were very sorry to have not kept an extra day in Hue to visit this place again...it truly requires 2 days of leisurely walking about to appreciate the many hidden wonders all around this huge Citadel.
Don't miss!!"
"It took us 4h to see everything. But we were not exactly rushing through. The architecture is beautiful and deserves well the unesco heritage title. There's some construction work ongoing, but the main sights are possible to visit.
We did it without a guide and was no problem! There are information panels spreaded around.
When buying the ticket, bare in mind that you may also want to see the tombs outside the city and in that case, buy the combined ticket.
The donwside was the lack of places to buy food, so make sure you have a nice meal before if you're also the kind of person that likes to take time to see monuments."
"To have some impressions of how looked the old city of Hue you need to visit this place.
Inside I recommend the theatre and the royal gardens mainly."
"This had a nice atmosphere and while the re obstruction is not completed, is a nice place to walk around away from the bustle of town. Worth doing while in Hue. We liked the area behind it within the living city as well. Walk up side streets and it's more quiet and interesting."
Definitely worth a visit. If possible take a guided tour. Allocate at least 3 hours if you enjoy history and architecture
Do not miss the citadel while staying in Hue. Like a dream! Allow loads of time for exploration... Every corner you turn is another part to explore.
"Upon entering the Imperial city, I can feel the history. The look, smell of an ancient city still lingers. The symmetry is precise throughout and all of the furnishings and decorations let you know you're standing before royalty. Definitely watch the video before walking through. Enjoy!"
"Old set of buildings in a beautiful compound, has a little charm of being from the past, but otherwise not that grand nor fancy. Still, worth a visit if you're in hue"
Game of thrones esqe. Includes video explaining where you are and digital reconstruction . a lot has been destroyed but the stuff that's there is worth seeing
One of the many highlights of a fabulous tour. Great dose of culture as we walked around this majestic parklands.
This is a massive place so wear your running shoes! We were a bit disappointed with our guide so I don't think we got the full understanding of the history of the place but we were glad we visited. We left from a different door than we entered so we ended up walking many extra kilometres around the whole complex...so pay attention!
We have visited similar and more famous forbidden palaces in the past. This one is better. Whilst dilapidated in places this makes it all the more atmospheric. Those areas of renovation which have been completed are sympathetic to the overall feel of the palace. Finally the information boards in some buildings are excellent at giving you exactly what you need to appreciate what it was like to live there.
"You can spend more than a day if you look all details.
There is a reconstruction work in some parts at the time we visited.
Some tourists groups were using electric car to move inside so elders and disabled can visit most of the places.
Clean toilets with toilet papers and soap.
A must visit in Hue."
"We visited the citadel, which is massive. The ticket is 150k vnd for foreigners and 120k vnd for Vietbamese folks.

There are informative video and exhibits to read about all the kings and now the citadel was used. It's a beautiful landscape.

You'll probably need at least 2 hours to explore all the buildings. Be sure to read the ""document exhibit""!"
Huge complex that is worth a few hours at least. Great UNESCO heritage site is a well-preserved treasure. Wonderful site that is huge!
"want to visit Hue imperial city? We thought it would keep us busy for half a day, and after 6 interesting hours we had to give up, having seen probably 75% of it. Probably the most interesting site in Vietnam, if you go where the masses don`t. Do this first and then go to Minh Mang and Tu Duc tombs. You`ll see things differently.
More than worth the price (oh, keep the ticket, it is valid for the neighbouring museum of royal antiquities)"
"It is the former imperial seat of government and Hue's prime attraction. Travelers can travel the city by either foot, tricycle, motorcycles and electric car. The road is so narrow that big cars are not allowed inside the city. I tried the tricycle and it was quite funny and relaxing."
"The Citadel is great if we consider it was destroyed during the war, they rebuilt it quite authentic, no modern materials, great history lesson about a recent Confucianist Empire. Observe Citadel sectors, forbidden city, architecture, decoratios, temples... they have foundations not rebuilt yet, but enough for the instant.
We do the city in 1 walking day: Imperial City by Phu Xuan bridge and main gate access, exit by Hien Nhon gate, then a 5 bucks MaiLinh taxi to Thien Mu tall pagoda, temples & garden, then same taxi 4 to old university, and an evening walk along the riverside Le Loi Bd till the rest & pubs area. You can get a bike for free from your hotel (or rent it cheap).
Maybe a 2nd day for beach lovers or 2 museums."
"This place gives you a good insight in the old vietnam! Many buildings to see, perfect for walking around and getting inspired. A bit touristy though."
We greatly enjoyed our tour of The Citadel. We only wish we had allowed more time. There is so much to see! The beauty comes from seeing both the 'weathered' and the original architecture. Allow extra time.
"Hue's main attraction, the former imperial capital with its palace, walled fortress and gates, moat and bridges is an impressive sight."
"Rather wet when we were here - but there was plenty to see & interesting photos on walls, Vietnamese architecture etc."
The citadel is huge and has many different rooms of worship. You can spend at least 3-4 hours seeing the beautiful and ancient architecture. Bring some food and lots of water if you are going in the morning.
Allow a good half day for this tour. It works best if you have a guide. The site seeing within these walls are amazing as is the history. I love to know the history of things and the Citadel is full of it.
"If you like to travel back in time and get to know more about Vietnam through its Imperial period, this is a must visit place when you’re in Hue. This citadel give insight into the history and architecture of Vietnam. Even though it cannot compared to China’s Forbidden City, I actually enjoyed the roughness and simplicity of the site. The buildings have interesting geometric patterns(created by bricks) which i quite like. Overall, this is an interesting place full of beautifull arts thats is worth to visit.
Be aware that this is a quite vaste place so it may took you a couple hours to explore its beauty."
Take the whole day and amble around the ancient city at a leisurely pace. We captured some beautiful photo perfect moments!
"A visit to the imperial city should not be missed. We hired a driver/car and this made the long day bearable but there are many tours and if we had more time I would catch the train for the experience. Allow a couple of hours to walk around, read the information and just absorb the enormity of the place. What amazing history!"
"A guide book to let you know what all the things are.

This has to be one of the most interesting Imperial Palaces after that of Beijing. Yes it is in the process of being restored and is about 250 years old but it has huge history through the ages.

Wander around and soak up the atmosphere. If you're not that into history then plan on an hour here but if you are into history allow 2 -3 hours.

Take a hat, water and sunscreen as it is very exposed in parts"
That very nice the main thing to see in Hue but too much repair and entrance fee 150.000vnd for 1 people is too expensive
"A good introduction to Vietnam history. Place to visit in Hue.
Nice to see ongoing restoration. Will be a grand place when fully restored."
"This was a little bit of a let down, not that exciting. If you are *really* into history, probably this is a better choice.

I walked all around, its pleasant if it isn't boiling hot, but nothing super stunning or amazing."
Had fun taking photos in traditional costumes at the Citadel. Good history education. Worth visiting!
"You need a fair bit of time and a knowledgeable guide, in order to attempt to understand the amazing history and impact of this attraction. That was the case for us! There are numerous buildings, including an amazing theatre, with fascinating stories underlying them. The people of Vietnam seem to really value their own history and the ways in which the country has evolved over time. If anything, we almost tried to do too much during the time we had on our 5th day in Vietnam. I would suggest a stay of at least two days in the City, to enjoy a Cyclo-ride around the sights and local market; possibly a boat trip on the river; visits to the mausoleum of Tu Duc, and the Museum aa well as the Imperial Citadel."
"The Imperial City in Hue used to be the former capital of Vietnam. It's architecture reeked of Chinese influence similar to the Beijing's Forbidden City.
Hence it is important to walk through the whole palace to better understand the history of this place, which has become a world UNESCO world heritage site. It is equally important to appreciate the unfluence the Chinese culture had on the Hue cuisine."
"Overall, I have been disappointed with Hue, but the Imperial city is impressive for what it it - full of history, and slowly being restored to it's former glory. Be prepared to spend a couple of hours and have your walking shoes on, as the area is quite large."
"We took a 3 hour ride from danang to go there, it's quite a disappointment, nothing much there other than 1 - 2 halls, most of the other room , they now used them to sell paintings n souvenirs. Watched a 15 minute video about citadel."
The Imperial city is quite big. This is a very interesting place to visit and will take at least a couple hours just to rush through. There are many interesting buildings to look at and imagine how they lived in the old times.
"This is supposed to be the jewel in thecriwn of the tiwn tbat is described as the heart beat of vietnam. If i was vietnamese I'd be embarrassed. The place was shambolic. The grounds were dirty and overgrown, the buildings were poorly maintained and unremarkable. There seemed to also be propaganda at every corner that seemed to bkame the 'American imperialists' for the state of the place. I appreciate that the area was involved in a fierce offensive but that was 40+ years ago. Also the American imperialists didn't cause the weeds to overgrow or the paint to crack or the toilets to be dirty or the general disrepair or the lack of information/guidance or the dirty ponds or the limited exibits..all of these were caused by the vietnamese. Who ever us in charge needs to take some responsibility and needs to sort this out. This place could be and should be amazing."
We had a few hours here as part of a tour. We have been to the Forbidden City too and both places share the vast lay out so lots of walking involved! A lot of the gates and buildings were beautifully ornate and decorated but were quite grubby and I wondered if they could have been carefully cleaned a bit. Gardens and ponds were nice and landscaped. Definitely worth a visit.
"At 150,000 dong to get in, this is relatively expensive compared to other attractions. There wasn't a great dealing of reading information, with a lot of it coming from our tour guide. Vietnamese history isn't something I know much about, so it would be good to have more background available.

The grounds are extensive, and if they were returned to their former glory it would be very impressive. For such a key historical sight, I'm surprised it's not maintained better.

In summary, worth a visit, but not amazing."
It is a nice tourist site! There were several building being renovated. There were lots of buildings that were not anything but a sign. It was an old site. Interesting history!
There are a lot of photographs of more recent imperial days. Plus information boards and a theatre to present music and dance. Can do this with guide book to save skimming round on organised tour.
"I have visit Hue Imperial City with my partner. It is built on a huge area and full of beautiful buildings. An absolut experience of vietnamese architecture. And great spot to take lots of photos.

Highly recommended"
"We really enjoyed just waking around and exploring different corners, taking photos and reading the captions at the exhibits. You can easily spend a few hours here so set a limit if you still have other sites to see or leave this for the last day on it's own."
"I was lost in another world, that of the Orient with all its charms! It was truly inspiring. Its history was also poignant."
We got a cyclo from our hotel and went to the Citadel.So glad we did.It is a must to do in Hue seeing all the old buildings and the history.1000000 dong entrance fee.So worth it
"Very interesting place, it's quite large so give yourself plenty of time if you want to do everything. It'll only take a few hours to complete. You can also get vehicle around if you have difficulty walking."
"Comparisons between the Citadel and Beijing's Forbidden City would be stretching it a bit too far. Most of the buildings in the compound are not even standing, some of those standing are rebuilt with no attempt to make the rebuilt structure have any semblance of aging (not much fun looking at a rebuilt building that looks spanking brand new - anyone can do this in any other part of the world). Those that are truly worth the time are few.

Signages within the compound are few and not of much help. We had the most fun after the entrance at the fish pond and in a building to the right of the compound where there is a lot of information on the Emperors and how they lived. It's a shame that the other buildings did not have the same amount of information.

Still, I suppose this would be a bucket-list item and compared to the various other tombs and pagodas, the Citadel would be the highlight.

Do watch out for the electric buggies that ferry visitors around.

Tickets are priced at VND 150,000 for adults and VND 30,000 for children aged between 7 to 12 years old."
"We spent 5 hours wandering around the inner citadel and it was beautiful! You can tell most visitors to this site only go to the main areas and miss out on so much of the peripheral areas. We watched a Chinese tour group only spend about 1-2 hours at most and they missed out on over half of what is available. This seems pretty typical with Chinese tour groups however. I would highly recommend avoiding joining large tour groups for this very reason! That and it is seldom local people benefit from these types of tours. Hire a local guide if you have to or better yet, get your own guide book and be your own tour guide! There were whole sections where we were the only 2 people around. It is stunning and filled with so much to see. Awesome time!"
"We visited on a rainy day but still spectacular. Hues answer to the Forbidden City. A real must see well worth a visit. Allow at least two hours as the site is spread out, with or without a guide a truly memorable experience."
"The amount of history embedded in this place is immense. Allow a half day or more to explore, a worthwhile visit even if you're not a history buff."
"A lot to see and a long distance to walk to see everything.
It rained when we were there which made it a bit of a drag.
But on a nice day it would be amazing."
"Reminded me of the forbidden city in Beijing. Unfortunately, most structure has been destroyed during the recent wars and rebuilt by unesco. Lost most of the original charm. Recommend paying for a buggy if you have older folks or young children as the weather can be very hot and quite far walking distance. Paid nearly VND750k for a 7-seater buggy."
"The citadel of hue is part of Vietnam culture. For that reason it should be part of the itinerary. Unfortunately the citadel is destroyed a couple of times. So many buildings are gone. Nevertheless there is ongoing restorations. So parts are good, some parts are even more then good. But it never gets to the amazing stage though. 1.5 hr should be enough to explore here! Personally i like the ancestors hall and its surroundings!"
Very worthwhile to visit to see the splendor of the ancient dynasties of Vietnam. One also observe a lot of similarities with Forbidden City of Beijing China.
"This is an impressive collection of buildings. Sadly some of them we destroyed in the Vietnam war and while some are under restoration , many are beyond restoration. Unfortunately it was very wet when we visited so strolling around the grounds was not an option. We were lucky to have a delightful and well informed guide. The Grand Throne palace -Thai Hoa , is very impressive and very well restored. The other really impressive interior is the Royal Theatre, which is still used for performances. The Dien Tho Palace -, Which was or the Queen Mother of the Emperor is also beautifully preserved. There were so many buildings to see but sadly ""rain stopped play"""
"There was so much to see! We bought the day pass to visit four different sites. We could've easily spent the day at The Citadel. We spent three hours here and still had more to see. There were a lot of renovations in progress. Many of the buildings were already renovated. The attention to detail in the architecture was impressive. A must see for history and architecture buffs.

TIPS:
- Bring water: there are not a lot of areas to get water and they are very expensive.
- Bring an umbrella: the sun can be strong and it rains often.
- Bring a travel guide book: It helps to have a map of the grounds and to learn a little history."
"Relatively expensive but worth the money. Only some parts of the Imperial City as unfortunately it was heavily bombed during the American War. The restoration and rebuilding works are still ongoing.
Tip: allow yourself at least an hour to go around the Imperial City."
"Looks as if built 1000 years or more years ago - in fact only some 200 years old. Nearly destroyed during the street fightings in Tet offensive 1968; large parts have been restored so the relatively high entrance fee (+100.000 VND) is worth it - make sure that you aren't short-changed on the entrance fee... Also beware of those tricky cyclo drivers telling unknowing travellers that the entrance gate is an exit only and they happily would get you to the ""real"" entrance - which in fact is the real exit where of course other cyclo drivers (probably friends or relatives ?) are available to bring you back to the entrance :) Seems to be a well organized rip-off... As in any other place in Asia make sure to negotiate the price before the cyclo trip. As an experiment we didn't do so and were confronted with a fare of 600.000 VND (!) per person for a 15 minute drive; finally paid total VND 70.000 which still was above 'real ' price but worth to experience the interesting bargaining tactics of the cyclo driver, not an agressive guy though; took it with a smile..."
"It seems like ages ago, but the citadel's history is not that old. It provides an excellent insight in the colonial history of vietnam. We especially loved the way the education system was set up, proving and keeping the power to one centralised authority; interesting."
"Hue Imperial city is one of your must-see places in Vietnam. The citadel is very impressive. There are five walls and moats to pass through. There is some reconstruction taking place to repair damage from time and various wars. We had a great afternoon strolling through the Imperial City. The renovated buildings give a very good impression of the majestic former citadel. They say it is modelled after other Asian Imperial forbidden cities. Our tour spoke in Vietnamese, with some parts translated into English for us. Very impressive. Recommend buying one of the Vietnamese farmers hats. Everyone loves seeing you wear it, and it helps to keep the sun and heat off, as Vietnam can be on the warm side. Hue is fabulous and the people are nice."
"Very historical place, nice citadel, garden. It is really stuning to walk around this place, it is a really mustsee. It is a little bit far from center so we rent a motorbike, parked it and enjoyed all day there. There were some musitians performing different types of vietnamese music....so touching"
"Impressive old citadel if you are interested in architecture and history defenetly worth to visit. If you plan to visit Thien mu pagoda, tue hieu temple, tu duc tomb or Minh mang tomb ask on the entrance of the citadel for a combo ticket than you will get the tickets cheaper they will not offer it to you and try to sell you single tickets"
"The complex was damaged during the war and there are many restoration projects currently being carried out. It's good to see the effort put into restoring and protecting the culture of the country.

The video explaining the history and the citadel layout was a highlight. It also has a digital reconstruction which is amazing. It helps visualise and appreciate the architecture better and makes it very interesting.

Be prepared to walk a lot. Wear comfortable shoes and carry water. Also take an umbrella depending on the weather."
"Hue Imperial city is a must see place in Vietnam. The citadel is veey impressive and although thr entrance fee is quite high (in comparison with other sights in Vietnam) it is certainly worth it, especially considering the fact that a lot of reconstruction is still taking place. We had a great afternoon strolling through thw citadel. The renovated buildings give a very good impression of the majestic former citadel. A lot still needs to be done and as result there are also quite some ruins still. As said, we would recommend the place in case you pass by in hue."
This place is great. It is very old but a fantastic way to see the history of Hue...Loved just walking around..
"Very old ancient buildings to see, not very interesting to myself especially not for 150k vnd, but if the money goes towards restoration thats ok i guess, need to have some ideas about the past of vietnam to make this an interesting stop, coolest thing to me was the massive Vietnamese flag on the old gate but you can see that from the outside lol! Worth a look for history fanatics."
"We were told this was a must. However, we were not that excited. The directions inside the citadel are completely absent and the service in coffee tents or other stores inside the walls is terrible. Woman at a coffee bar (just left after entering the citadel) tried to charge us double price, even though we saw the prices on the menu. She even tried to hassle her way out by claiming she gave us extra large size. That was awkward.
There are some nice views inside, for sure, but in my opinion not worth the 150000 dong. Better rent a motorcycle and visit some of the tombs scattered around the city."
"This tour was very interesting. However, be sure to take a sun hat etc as it was extremely hot and humid. We think it best to get a guide for this tour as it is so vast and the information given when entering is minimal"
"You might like this if you're interested in the era or history in general. I found it really boring and tedious. Most of the city is either destroyed and long gone, or has been restored a couple of years ago, so I don't see much point of seeing it. Nothing I saw there impressed me. A quick look at the history of it on youtube would have been better."
The Hue imperial city is a must visit location for anyone interested in immersing themselves in the stellar and wonderful history of this city and the founding Fathers. Beautifully re built to original grandeur it recaps the original citadel with accuracy and respect. Very easy to spend 2-3 hours wondering around.
"We didn't actually go in as it was too expensive for us. We were consistently harassed by rickshaw drivers on the way there and although it looks impressive, we didn't think much to it."
"Our guide to this city was a very sympathetic Buddhist follower and being taken around by him was a delight. He gave us the history of the monuments and the rulers who created them. The gardens are very well preserved and the whole tour was memorable.,"
This place is huge and could be explored all day long! We went with a tour and didn't stay as long as we would've liked. It has a museum inside and lots of shops. Ice cream at the end was a must considering the heat. A must go in Hue!
Must see in Hue. This is a historical site which has remnants of its old imperial glory. You can see some relics like the throne but much of the Nguyen dynasty's glory have been devastated by war and plundering. Go with a tour guide that knows about the history of the Hue. Stop and watch the video to get an idea of how the citadel was built and how the emperors lived within.
"Had a great time here, the place itself it fascinating & so enjoyable to walk round, although take a lot of water as it's so hot & water in there is double the price. The only things I would mention is the size of the place, it's very big!! If you have difficulties walking for along time this could be a issue. Also, for some bizzare reason the entrance you come in your rudely told your not allowed to exit from, so you have to walk another quarter round the place. Also, you aren't given a map, which becomes pretty tricky after walking through a lot of buildings & archways the look similar! Great day out though, would recommend to get a real feel for Hue."
"It is definitely interesting to go see the histotical royal palace and learn a lot about the Vietnamese history and political structure; however, it is definitely overrated. Most of the buildings are under construction/renovation, so you cannot fully enjoy the sight. The numerous souvenir shops also make the place resemble a market place rather than a historic sight, and the excessive invitations from the shop owners kind of ruined the whole experience. There weren't a lot of things to see, but a lot to read, regarding the royal family and the way they operated.
Despite all, I do think it is a must-visit place once you come to Hue. We would probably come back to visit the place after all the reconstruction is done. It's just so not worth the money you're paying..."
"I found this a very interesting place to visit, but then I had a guide to show me around. I feel certain that a guide can provide a more in depth insight to most sightseeing venues and this was no exception.
The citadel is subject to a lot of reconstruction and rebuilding, however this doesn't impact greatly on the sites or photo opportunities.
Allow about 1/2 to 1 hour to see this Unesco listed site"
"A kingdom of days gone by.

This could be a whole day experience. I HIGHLY recommend a guide!!! We did not do this but found ourselves resting on the outskirts of the tours of others and hearing so much history of this exceptional place.

This palace was the highlight of our visit to Hue!!!!!!! For certain a ""bucket list"" destination."
"While it can not hold a candle to the Forbidden City in Beijing, it is interesting in itself. While heavily damaged by bombing during the war, they are busy restoring it slowly (they hope to be done in 10 years or so). Make sure to watch the video that has computer animations to recreate what the grounds looked like when all the buildings were new."
"Enough said by my title. Even though this is still a huge pride of all vietnamese, it's being ruined by the local authority. Entrance ticket was too damn high. A lot of sites were under reconstructed (and I know it's gonna take years to finish). And all the cyclo drivers were too annoying, asking for very high fee also. Food in Hue is amazing, spend your time explore it, much better than wasting your money here."
"We enjoyed the Citadel. We were unable to see the whole thing, it is massive. Plan accordingly and take plenty of water and plan to buy some. It's was unbearably hot in April. Beautiful photo opportunities, lovely walk, stunning architecture, history. I highly recommend reading up on the history before you go, it adds to the experience."
"Cannot compare to the forbidden city in Beijing. However, worth a visit. One of the most important in center Vietnam"
"It's definitely the MUST SEE PLACE in HUE, the old capital of Vietnam. Take a look at the digital reconstruction then you can see how the imperial palaces were heavily damaged during Vietnam war. It's being gradually restored and slowly get back it's beauty."
"Most people come to Hue to see this, and it is a place with a lot of history. Having a guide helped. Told there was a restoration (perhaps ongoing) but some things still look a little rough. Mind not to turn an ankle while walking around. Spent more time than was necessary, in my opinion, under 2 hours will do for the average visitor."
"I personally think this is very overrated. We had a total of 1 1/2 hrs to spend with the tourist group. The citadel is not in great shape, as are many sites in Hue :-/
A max of 45 min's would have done it."
"As this attraction was'nt far from our hotel and we felt in need of some exercise we decided to walk to the citadel. We got directed down the wrong street by a cyclo driver and missed the main entrance gate. The cyclo driver then repeatedly tried to get us to take his tour and kept following us. Between the lack of side street signs and having to fend off the cyclo driver we got lost and ended up at one of the side gates and had to walk around to the main gate. However once inside the walls we were pleased we had continued. The buildings are still being restored and construction was ongoing in several places. But what was restored was interesting, and it was easy to see what it would have been like in its heyday. The site is quite large and you do need at least a couple of hours to see it all. I found the short video showing a digital representation of what the citadel would have looked like, good,but needed to be slowed down a little. There were quite a good collection of black and white photos of several emperors and court officials which helped to bring the site to life. Most had english captions. I just hope that this site does not become overwhelmed with little shops everywhere and people in every nook and cranny trying to sell you something as it would spoil the whole feel of the place."
"We visited the Imperial City early this morning, costs 150VND per person for entry and allow around 3 hours for the attraction.

Beautiful architecture surrounds this vast space but I was disappointed to see a tennis court with flood lights in the middle? Who on earth thought that was a good idea? Such a shame we have a habit of doing this around the world.

All in all its an amazing feat of architecture, worth a visit if you're in Hue."
"We visited as its one of the main things to see. Its a big site and has many restored buildings, there are no original buildings as this was one of the fiercest battles in the war. That said they restoration is very good. We did it with a guide who was informative which really helped. We wanted to follow the Top Gear route, as they stopped here. You will not be disappointed by coming to this site"
impressive structure and interesting history. our guide was knowledgeable and really gave us background of this ancient city. very interesting.
"I went to Hue City specifically for visiting the Citadel. In all guidebooks there is the indication that it has been bombarded by French, but non tell that the Imperial Town inside the Citadel has been completely destroyed"
Well worth a visit. Allow at least 2 or 3 hours for your trip and make sure you visit the separate royal Museum.
"The Citadel, aka the Imperial City, is the triple-walled compound established in the early 1800's when Hue was Viet Nam's capital. While some buildings have deteriorated over time, and others have been destroyed during the Viet Nam war, others have been restored. Regardless of their condition, they are all beautiful palaces and temples that provide insight into the combination of Vietnamese, Chinese and French influences."
"This is an OK way to spend some time in Hue and yes there are some nice photo opportunities and interesting spots. However, this was not at all worth the 150VND charge. There is no way it should be that much, 50VND at best... and to be honest after you're in there a while its extremely samey."
"This place is overpriced, especially due to tourists being charged more than locals, if you tried to do that in my country you would be labeled a racists due to blatant discrimination. However the sights inside and the history that surrounds this place makes it a must do while in hue"
"Spread over a vast area ,with the welcome sight of Vietnamese flag guarded by 4 canons on one side and 5 on other totalling to a lucky number of 9, the citadel is under massive restoration work. Whatever is completed gives an idea about its majestic original form. Would definitely like to see it completed."
We were fortunate to have a personal guide to show us through this massive site. With the site slowly being reconstructed following the war. [What is it good for - absolutely nothing]. The history surrounding the Imperial City is just as interesting as the buildings themselves.
the old king house - the citadel is a remarkable piece of attraction. you could see emperor daily life/
"It's good to see this old traditional palace complex being restored but by bit, it's an interesting place to spent at least half a day, much of it well-curated in English, French as well as Vietnamese. It's good to see what they have restored as well as the form areas that resulted from war. There are severso small aspects that can be improved, but even in a day of torrential rain, this was an experience not to miss."
"We came with a private guide, and found the grounds expansive, scenic, and sprawling. They do have carts that can take you around the grounds, and that might be the better alternative given the heat and size of the Citadel. I think we spent about an hour walking around, which was more than enough time, even with a knowledgeable guide."
The citadel is well preserved and definitely worth a visit. This was the site of a fierce battle during the Tet Offensive as well as being of great ancient historical importance.
"It is a very interesting place. We see they are rehabilitating the place, in order to make it the closets it was before. Some improvement need to be done, for example, location maps in the site, different types of itineraries, a site map when you buy the ticket entrance."
"You can see Vietnamese old history at this palace, feel interesting things about king ordinary life- he can possess 800 wives."
"I spent a bored 4 hours going round this, although many will rave about it only dates from about 1800 (I have lived in older houses!)

Not the highlight of our trip to Vietnam for me would gladly have missed it."
"Obviously most of it is in Vietnamese, but some of the stories and articles are very interesting, worth it but bring your walking shoes as you will clock up a few thousand steps"
"It's one of the must visit place in Hue as Hue was the Royal City before and at the Imperial Palace you will find the historical story from the past. Take time to walk around, though it might not be comparable to other countries historical site but I think it will give you some good relax time and to fall back in the past for a bit. There's a walking track which very peaceful with the old big trees. It's very photogenic on a sunny day."
This is must do in Hue and really the main reason to visit this city. Advisable to do with a guide as the history of the Royal Family is intricate but fascinating. Make sure you spend at least half a day here.
We wandered around here for a good hour but there was still plenty that we didn't see. Lots of history from our guide from Asia Top Travel which made the tour more interesting
"Interesting little town but two days should be enough to see the famous pagoda, citadel and try some of the famous local food."
"This is a huge complex of temples , palaces and state buildings along with the Royal palace. Allow half a day to visit everything. Although not as awe inspiring as Beijing's Forbidden City it is one of the main reasons for visiting Hue Many of the buildings look as though they have suffered the ravages of neglect but there is now a comprehensive restoration project as befits a UNESCO world heritage sight."
"I was quite blown away and apparently so was a large part of the complex by the French. I only managed half a day here as we were on a bike tour through Hue bike tours, so we were on the move.
The Vietnamese government is spending quite a bit to redo some of the damaged areas and when finished I think will quite spectacular.
Personally I would like to read more about the history, as while it is a lot younger than Angkor way, the history would maybe help me to understand the Vietnamese imperial collapse, the French colonial system and ultimately the take over by the communists."
"Loved the history part! There is a movie which shows you a little bit about the history of this place, with english subtitles. It's interesting, but qualifies for a visit for maybe 2 hours, not longer."
"The current admission price is 150k VND per pax, while the entry to the 3 tombs (Minh Mang, Khai Dinh and Tu Duc) costs 100k VND each.

If you are planning to visit all 4 attractions, you can get a bundle admission ticket for the imperial citadel and the 3 tombs at 360k VND instead (as of Dec 2015).

The citadel itself was worth a visit, but it would be preferable to have a guide to explain the significance. Some of the buildings are being restored, so hopefully it gets better with time."
"We walked through the imperial city the other day and had an excellent time. It was very interesting to see the real buildings even the restored ones!! The best part was the garden right at the back or the right hand side, but nobody else seemed to be going there. It was so peaceful like a little oasis! Would be a great spot for a small picnic! Although our legs were exhausted from walking by the end of the day, it was well worth it!!"
My main reason for visiting Hue was to see The Citadel. The forbidden city part was basically destroyed during Tet in 1968.The rest of The Citidal was severely damaged but all of it is being carefully restored. It is fascinating to learn about the period that kings ruled this part of Vietnam.
This is well worth a visit. The sheer scale is unbelievable. Restoration is clearly ongoing and will be for some considerable years to come. The video is well worth the time to gain background.
"The Citadel has many original features, a lovely moat around the outside wall to start with. There is a lot of information on the various kings in one particular area. A lot of the building/s have been ""renovated"" but in fact, I would say that ""result"" better describes it. Is this what we go to see? I am not sure about that. There are plans at some point to do more rebuilding where some buildings were bombed during the war. This is a World Heritage Site and well looked after.
It was a very hot day when we visited, our driver phoned for an electric bus to come and collect us and take us back to the car park - lovely."
Very interesting culture and historical heritage site about the imperial city .... A Must see whilst in Vietnam.
"We only stayed one night in Hue and we spent our day with, amongst others, visiting the citadel. It was a really impressive area (especially the main entrance) with huge and artistic buildings. It costs 150000 dong to get inside the area and we thought that it was money well spent. We wandered around inside the citadel for about 2 hours and got to see and learn quite alot that we didn't know before. The restoration of the destroyed houses in the area is ongoing and as the time passes my guess is that the citadel will only become more and more impressive. It is also a good place to visit just to realise how wars affect a city and it's important places."
"I was glad we came to Hue as part of our tour around Vietnam. The Imperial city highlights the influence of China & it was interesting to see the buildings here after having been to Hanoi & before going to Saigon. Before we planned our holiday I hadn't appreciated that there were emperors in Vietnam from 1802 until 1945. We had a good guide who took us swiftly around, & explained & showed to us the key buildings."
"This was the main reason for our visit to Hue, so we were prepared on the historical background and significance. Once through the moat and well-preserved wall, the traffic is thankfully very light and the overall impression is of a quiet, orderly life – not at all the military atmosphere suggested by the name “citadel”. After passing by the Flag Tower, we headed for the Noon Gate and the various well-preserved halls, palaces and temples. We spent most of our time in the Forbidden Purple City. Upon exiting through the East Gate, our guide did not mention the nearby museum of history and nobody else seemed to care much. Overall, the combo Imperial City/Forbidden City is a “must see” in Hue."
We were on our own for our visit and had no problem getting around and getting a feel for the place. There is a video in one of the buildings that was worth the time to watch. Our only difficulty was finding the door out when we wanted to leave. It did not occur to us that there was a side exit so we had to go back to get out. While the sight still needs some restoration it is clearly a project that is getting a lot of work. Things don't have to be perfect to be enjoyed.
"I think when you are in Hue, you have to visit this place. It easily takes half of a day but is totally worth it. Very interesting, it's a mix of ruins, restaurations, pictures and written explanation. It can be a little tricky to keep your orientation but it's a very informative in my opinion."
The old Citadel is full of history we really enjoyed to visit it there is many different places. You can visit with motorbike or the bike or walking directly.
After a few weeks in Asia we were getting a little templed out but this attraction was actually very good. What I liked about was that there was plenty of information to read which greatly increased my knowledge of the dynasty's of times gone by. The place is going through renovation so at time in the future it will be even better. Get there early to beat the heat and the crowds.
Our guide brought this place to life. Very interesting history of the emperors who lived here. Would love to see it again when fully restored.
Interesting visit through an historical landmark in Hue. But there is alot of Citadel is damaged by human and the weather. It need to more attention from local government.
"Interesting attraction and a walk back to the past. It's a pity that a lot of the building and destroyed during the war. They are taking steps to refurbish the palace now. There were some French elements that existed. But again, quite run down, plants not groomed."
"We paid 150,000 each to enter this place. It really isn't worth it. It was so heavily bombed that its gone. There are a couple of nice buildings left but not much information around. To say its a world heritage sight is ridiculous, especially as there are pictures of the other UNESCO heritage sights in the middle of the citidale to remind you how great the others are.
Don't go. Save your 150,000!!!!!"
"Forget about all those review saying you have to use guide to enjoy this place, etc. First you have to ask yourself first, do you like to see historical sites, and walk around between gardens and old buildings?

If you do, then just do it yourself. Buy the 150.000 vnd ticket, and explore by yourself. You'll love it. There will be information everywhere. BUT if you don't like these kind of things, then hiring a guide won't be helpful at all.

I recommend you visit the royal theatre, watch the movie about the citadel, explore the gardens, and feed the fish at the pond located at the northest part of the complex."
"The whole city waa ruined by the American/Vietnamese war. You can see bullet holes at some places that reminds you of the battle here.

There is some restorarion going on but they are far from finished. I would guess that only 10% is left to see what once was a beautiful emperor city."
Thoroughly enjoyed wandering around this place. Wonderful place to take photos and so very interesting . Such good value and a Unesco Heritage Site.
"The imperial city is very nice place to visit you must to go there , I haven't had a good tour around it because when I was there was raining a lot but I could see a good part of the imperial city and I can tell is very nice place to go is full of history"
Impressive old city with many sights well worth going for. It might be hot but there are places to get water. You'll need 1/2 a day minimum to get round and a guided tour would help enormously.
Vietnam’s Forbidden City on a smaller and less impressive scale. There are many structure being restored to its former glory damaged by war and neglect. The splendor of the imperial court was not on display so there is some disappointments. But historically a very important site to appreciate the history of Vietnam. A must visit.
"This Imperial City is being slowly renovated, there are large empty spaces where once there were buildings (and probably will be again)

TBH - if I knew this was to be the highlight of the tour of Hue I probably would have given the town a miss"
"The citadel is a must visit - it is huge and can take a good 2.5 / 3 hours to walk around. Avoid going in the peak of the afternoon as there is not much shade and it gets very very hot.

Try following the internal map so you can cover everything in an organised manner. Requires a lot of walking."
"The Imperial City is a must see when visiting Hue. It is the site of the old ruling family back when Hue was the capital of Vietnam. Sadly, this UNESCO World Heritage site is not being that well maintained. The staff is quite knowledgeable about it. The whole country is proud of it.

We have family who live close by and the Imperial City is located between where we stay and their house, so in addition to visits there we have literally driven by hundreds of times.

It is not advisable to visit this place in heavy rain or after a heavy rain. Depending on the season, this could be difficult in Hue. If possible, try to visit on a more Sunny day, and dress appropriately since it will be hot. If it is not possible to avoid visiting during heavy rain, wear some shoes that you don't mind getting wet and which will help you wade around. The reason, water tends to accumulate in many places inside the Imperial City and navigation is nearly impossible in many areas. This makes it very hard to move around."
"If you are a backpacker with a small budget so don't go.
It is a nice site but very expansive for what you get."
Make sure that you come here with a group over 10 people to contact with the receptionist to get a tour guide. It's huge place so you need an general introduction first. You also have to charge some money if you wanna take a picture.
"I came here expecting something unique, mysterious and historical but all I saw were run down empty buildings. If you don't go with a guide, you won't understand anything and the guides are $70 so I didn't bother. Instead I wandered around in the heat, not knowing what I was seeing although what I was seeing wasn't that pretty. There are a few nice buildings but all in all, the only thing to do here is to walk down the endlessly long lanes, peer into one of the crumbling gates then walk down another long, long lane to more gates and buildings, none of which are labeled. They don't offer maps and the entrance fee is double what they make the natives pay. It's overpriced and unless you're willing to pay for a guide, you won't get much out of it."
"What an amazing historic site! Every visitor to Vietnam should go to Hue to see this Versailles of SE Asia. Tragically a fraction of its once bustling little city, the Citadel and Imperial City nonetheless a breath-taking reminders of imperial Vietnam.

The downside are the annoying vendors you seem to run into everywhere. Don't make eye contact, and wave both your hands out in front of you and say NO and they seem to give up."
I travelled Vietnam for two and a half weeks from south to the north and this is by far the worst thing you can get for that amount of money. Compared to all the other sites and museums in Vietnam this place is really expensive (propably due to the UNESCO tag). It is ok but I saw lots of better things.
"this is unique place in Vietnam that have this type of building. it is nice, but because i visited it lot of time (with my friends, my customers) so i feel bored when visit again :)
if you want me to go with you pls contact skype: nhakhtn"
We spend 3/4 hours walking around the imperial city exploring all the buildings and ruins. It was interesting learning about the history of the site and imaging what it would have been like during the emperors reign.
"Thank you so much for the day tour in Hue and also the ride from Hue to Hoi An the next day!! In Hue we saw so many beautiful and interesting places. Thinh had so much to tell about the history and culture. Just unbelievable. The ride from Hué to Hoi An was just BEAUTIFUL! I didn't want it to end:D Thinh and his friend are amazing. We can warmly recommend these tours. We learned so much. THANK YOU THINH!

-Julia and Anni"
I went here with my girlfriend on the 16-11-2015. This site is very interesting to see although some parts are still under construction but the parts which are finished are very impressive to see and it gives you a very good impression of how the emperor family and its ministers lived here during that time and the you can easily walk around here for a couple of ours the site is really huge.
We spent 2 hours there with our private tour guide. The structures were amazing (some damage form war's)The history around this place is amazing with many old photo's.Well worth the trip.
"We stopped here during a cycle tour, the place is very interesting and i wish we had more time to explore all the buildings."
"Went here after Hanoi city, this is a big citadel in Vietnam. It's a history of Vietnam. I can learn about king place, food , construction ."
"The citadel was built in times when Hue was capital city of Vietnam. Inside you can see interesting temples and buildings which served king and the royal family. Around citadel is high and thick wall made of bricks. The old town itself is walled and you get in through old gates. There are a lot of big and old trees so it is nice to walk around.
The citadel is being renovated so the old buildings get constantly better.
You should give at least 2 hours for visiting citadel inside. After you visit you can try local beer in one of local resteaurant ;)"
Had a great day just meandering through the citadel taking photographs and competing with partner for best photograph. It was a peaceful space within the bustle of the city.
"Ensure you get there early to avoid the crowds. Very hot when we were there so take hat and drinks.
The buildings are all re-created or majorly refurbished but the vast scale is impressive."
Came here with a tour group. Spent a couple hours walking around and taking in the sights. Would definitely recommend a guide....you really have no idea what you are looking at. History is incredible!
This is a very large palace and give yourself a few hours at least to take it all in. Just beautiful grounds and amazing history. Do not try to do this witout a guide or you will not know what you are looking at. Don't miss this one!
The visit to the Citadel was an eye opener as to how the rich and famous lived in the 19th century. Many of the buildings have been beautifully restored and the area is flat so easy to get around. They also have electric cars to take you from one section to another as the site is quite extensive.
"We wander,through corridors of Bright Vermillion,the photographs and descriptions of the past are beautifully presented each one worth reading.I learnt so much about the past here.As others have commented it's like The Forbidden City without the crowds.
If you have time for nothing else in this city,I would choose here.But it's hot and covers a large area.Pace yourselfs."
Basically the Nguyen dynasty seem to have copied the Beijing forbidden city and then during all the conflict this place has been mostly destroyed through bombing. Info inside is limited and the buildings are falling apart. However not much else to see in Hue.
"Definitely the must-see of Hue. Really impressive imperial city. Exhausting when it's really hot, but more than worth walking around and seeing the history of the Nguyen dynasty."
"Visited this site with my boyfriend, there is so so much to look at so make sure you make plenty of time, a few hours should do it! It is open from 7am-5.30pm, some locals will tell you it is closed, so go on their tour for 1 hour and get back for it opening again. This is a lie!! Just go anyway and ignore them, every man with a bike wants to take you on a tour so head straight to to citadel if you want to!

There are free toilets, coffee and souvenir shops on site so don't worry about that.

My problem with this tourist site however is that it costs tourists 150,000 to get entry and 120,000 for locals. Tourists are sent to another ticket point which I find extremely annoying as 120,000 is expensive anyway! But, the site is so huge and a main tourists attraction you can't not go visit really."
"Really impressed with this place, particularly when you remember that this placed was nearly bombed to kingdom come, by various aggressors over the years. Spend at least a couple of hours looking around as there is much to see from a historical and cultural point of view."
"The imperial citadel sounds pretty impressive and somehow is... But: the place is mostly just one big construction site and ancient relicts are not being treated with the respect they deserve.
Not worth 10€ I think but somehow also a must see if you already stopped in hue."
"To wander around where the rulers of Vietnam used to wander around is a true privilege. Make sure you go around with a guide, so much going on that wouldn't be understood otherwise. Another site that the Americans decided sticking their nose in and bombs would improve...so restorations going on but all part of the city's history now. Still places where bullet holes in walls still obvious. On many levels, an excellent tour and view into Vietnam history."
This was my second visit to the citadel in 5 years and I still find it amazing. The restorations which were in progress those years ago have been completed and I was just in awe of how beautiful they were. Worth this visit.
"The fact we'd had an overnight train journey and a hours internal flight just prior to our visit might have had us missing some of the finer points. Also the temperature this day was 31°C - that also might have adjusted our concentration (it was much cooler in Sa Pa)

Plus our guide, who must have studied her subject for years, knew every date, name, event going back hundreds of years and the whole place is absolutely HUGE. She shouldn't have tried to do it all at once and ought to train herself to speak more slowly.

Notwithstanding all this moaning though, the place is magnificent, worth a visit and will impress anyone."
"It is an absolute must for everyone paying a visit in Hue. Great photography opportunities. Be sure to allocate a few hours to see it and learn about the place. There are cafes inside, so there is a chance to drink iced Vietnamese coffee!"
Had a guided tour around the imperial city. Really enjoyed learning some history and seeing the old buildings. Would definitely recommend.
"If you have been to the Forbbiden City in Beijing, you'll find it similar to it. It's a huge complex full of buildings, lakes, houses, gardens, small museum etc.

Makes you imagine how intimidating must have been for the people to go in front of the emperor 200 years ago.

If you stay in Hue you MUST go there."
"This is the main attraction in Hue. Although much smaller than the one in Beijing, it's still worth visiting."
basically this was the site where Vietnamese royal family and emperor lives so it's definitely require a visit if in Hue! However not very well preserved walls very torn down and dirty and right next to the Citadel are badminton court and locals' huts.
"This is an example of an attraction in SE Asia that could and should be awesome but instead it is just about taking the tourist dollar. Most of the citadel is still under construction and walking around in the baking hot sun is kind of boring and tiring. If they had free guides or even just free audio guides it would be much better and the different prices for locals and foreigners in SE Asia is always annoying. Could you imagine if the same thing was done in Europe? I stood behind three backpacker girls in the queue who claimed to be kids so they only paid 30,000 dong to enter. I couldn't bring myself to do the same blatant lie so i forked out the full 150,000 dong. It's kind of a rip off for Vietnam and you could argue that something like this should be free to all anyways. 1 hour is more than enough time to see this and take a selfie."
"Very well preserved site. Good display of information in vietnamese, france and english. Equiped with video watching corner. Not much crowd. But quite hard to find out out without a map handy. Some interior no picture allowed. The books there about 70-150% higher that suggested retail price. The price tag will cover up the printed suggested retail price. Each book stalls at each complex sell at different price. The books seller wearing officer uniform but the selling price very un-uniform."
"Its a nice big place to walk around, only need an hour or 2, Horses look like they have been mistreated and don't get fed enough and looked after. They look extremely depressed and sick. I can't imagine why anyone would want to jump in the cart."
"Don't rush through this place, there are many interesting places to explore through the partly rebuilt, reclaimed palace. What it must have been like to live within its walls when it was at its best..."
Less impressive than I expected because a big part of the citadel is ruined or being rebuilt. The parts in good condition (or recovered) are very nice however. The visit takes its tie because the place is huge.
So much history. Very interesting to walk through. Currently under reconstruction but still available to view most of the sights within.
There is an interesting video about the restoration. The Citadel is very large so give yourself half a day to see it properly. My top tip is to ask for an all in one ticket to the Tombs as it is cheaper this way. This ticket is not advertised but it is available if you ask the ticket teller.
The place helps one understanding the kingdom' s times way of leaving and ruling. Not much to see if compared to Angkor Wat for example and perhaps 1 our tour it is enough.
"We went without a tour guide and wandered round for 1-2 hours. That was plenty of time and made us glad we went on our own as it could get a bit boring.Worth a look, but the horse that they had there for carting around tourists looked sick and not looked after, this was the only real down-side but its an unfortunate common thing to see in SEA these days."
"Interesting visit through an historical landmark in Hue. The best of all is the amazing Bonsai garden, where you can spend hours admiring the ancient man-crafted art pices."
I had not seen the Hue Citadel in 45 years and it is much improved since then (no war helps). There is a lot of construction and reconstruction going on within the Citadel and the Vietnamese can take pride in this jewel for the 19th century. A great walk within the City of Hue.
I spent a few hours here. It was so interesting. The gardens were very pleasant to walk around. The palace is under reconstruction but offers lots of beautiful temples to visit. There is a museum at the exit also worth. I visited st low season for foreign tourist but high season for VietNamese tourist. Lot of interection and photos with people coming in from rural areas.
You really need to visit The citadel even though it is not well looked after. We were told by a guide that the money to restore it was coming from foreign investment but now it's getting cut. I really hope they restore it to their former glory. it's a magnificent place. We visited at sunrise and it was powerful.
"The Citadel in Hue is well worth a visit for a few hours to see some of the remaining buildings and also read about some of the history of former rulers of Vietnam including the relationship with the French and effects of the American war. We did it without a guide but they are available for additional cost to the150,000 VND entrance fee pp."
lots of walking in the very hot weather - but worth it and so much to see. you can just about imagine how life was in its day. walking through history and having the best guide to explain everything was a definitive plus!
"Impressive building.  Although this place is smaller in scale and resemble a Chinese imperial palace greatly, there are still part of it which differentiated them. It is a pity that most of the internal buildings are no longer around due to the war.  And restoration work and even new buildings are now in the process within the citadel. Spent more than 3 hours walking around with my student guide.  A point to note is that one could easily lost their way within the Citadel without a guide as there are no direction signs or map available.   Definitely worth a visit to see the home of the short-lived Imperial Dynasty."
"The Imperial Citadel is quite a grand set up and as per the model kept there, it was a world of its own. Much of it has been destroyed in the 20th century wars in the area. Where there were buildings, today there are wide courtyards and gardens. The buildings which remain are quite impressive. There is a lot of walking involved."
"Larger than I thought, give yourself a few hours to walk around this amazing place. You can have a tour guide or just self guide as I did. Very interesting to see the history of this area."
"We have been here many times. We were fascinated already when in our teens and as seniors still are. Beautiful serene, quiet and peaceful and gracious, much better than the palace in Peking. Beware that one was constructed by the Vietnamese arcitect Nguyen Anh who was taken prisoner when Ming invaded and occupied Vietnam in 1407 We been here in 1989, in 2014 twice and in 2015 even three times and it still grows on us in beauty, no wonder it is under the unesco wings"
"We left it too late to get a guide and we only had 4 hours to get around the Imperial City. After reading other reviews I thought we would be completely lost and not really get much out of it. Lonely planet gave a good oversight and keeping track of where we were on Google Maps made sure we saw everything. Very interesting, worth the trip but be prepared to pass out from exhaustion afterwards!"
Stopped here when visiting the area and found this a really well presented attraction. Lots of learning about the history of the era and enjoyed the visit
"Visiting the Imperial City was our main reason for travelling to Hue from Da Nang. Inside the Citadel, which is free to enter is the Imperial City which you have to pay to enter. We spent two hours wandering around the palace and gardens. It's a big space but we couldn't see the point of hiring the electric cars. I agree that a better map would be very useful. Well worth the visit."
"Nice grounds!
Gives good idea of how the Imperial family and extended family lived. A mini Forbidden City!"
"I really enjoyed this very picturesque, historical and interesting sight. I took many amazing pictures of the grounds an buildings and learned a lot about the history of Vietnam. The temples are so well preserved, and such an amazing feeling of the many trials and tribulations of this fascinating culture is so present"
"It is very nice and meaningful for us. The old ancient of Vietnamese, through visiting the heritage we can imagine the living of Vietnamese social in the last century."
"This place was stunning and there is a lots of history to learn, we did this as part of the city tour I wouldn't recommend this purely because the 2hrs you spend there isn't enough to see it all and the tour guide tended to rush through the interesting parts and spend s lot of the time talking so you didn't get much time to explore.
There are plenty of sign posts up explaining the artefacts and buildings so it'd be easy enough to navigate around and still learn all about the history!"
"We found the Citadel very impressive but a little on the boring side the buildings were in there day very brilliant, but after China a little boring. You have to be careful of the cyclo drivers who will tell you the place is closed to try and get you to have a trip with them
The price a little high at 1500000 a little bit steep.
But has I say if you're in history you will enjoy the Citadel

GeoffandBrenda"
If you need a break from the motor scooters this is a cool day trip. Be sure to get a guide. Easy to do in a half or full day. Unless you are a Vietnamese history buff this an ok place to skip.
"This was an impressive city. Only a day is required to see this place.

We had no guide so we relied on the descriptions. Perhaps you might want to consider getting a guide to provide more info on what you see."
There had been some good restoration of this area because in the war much of it was destroyed. There is a lot of good information and old photographs of the imperial court and the successive kings. Well worth a visit. The gardens are also very pretty.
"We spent a little over half a day here. It was interesting but somewhat lacking in useful signage and neither the map of central Hue provided by the hotel nor the one in Lonely Planet were particularly useful (though they both referenced different attractions in the Citadel so by reading them together you get a better - though still incomplete - idea of what is what). Interestingly in a covered way towards the left rear of the area there were a number of old maps on large signs on the wall that showed what had been there and gave a much better picture of the entire site. They would be much better if they were located at the entrance (and printed for purchase).
Towards the end of the visit, when we had just about had enough, we were near the Co Ha gardens. We nearly decided not to bother but we're pleased we went. It has an extensive collection of bonsai and is really worth the visit (I am no big fan but these were worth seeing).
One thing to note is that, as you exit the site through the gate on the eastern side, there is a free electric shuttle to the nearby 'General Museum Complex' which is included in the admission price to the Citadel (so keep your ticket). It is located in an interesting old building with a good collection of porcelain etc but the highlight for me was the collection of old cannon and cast statues in the garden. Not to be missed."
"I absolutely loved my visit here.
We had a wonderful tour guide with us that no doubt helped us enjoy the experience here as she told us a great deal about the history of this site and the royal family.

Definitely a must see if you are visiting Hue."
"So big.
Walk around there i see everythings very nice,very old.you must visit the imperial if you come hue.
I will come back."
"For sure, I cant compare this with the forbidden city in China. But when I walked along the alley in imperial city of Hue, unconsciously I compared it. China has its own history and it's very grand for the size.

Hue's is smaller, but beautiful. Also, some are ruins and still under reconstruction.
But this is the interest point here....its originality,i still can feel the ambience of this city during its era.
Too bad the war destroyed it.

The easy way to explore it is enter from the main gate, the one with a fortress wuth flag. Once you are in the purple city, just go straight through the ruins up to golden statue. Then you may explore the right side of the city. I found the left side doesnt many things to see.

Dont forget to bring hat, umbrella, and water.
Entrance fee for foreigner is 150k dong.
They have electric car service with additional fee."
"This tour I would recommend that you went with the guide in an electric car around the site, it is that big that it's really really hard to get around on foot, If you go it alone it is likely you will miss some of the major points if you try to do this navigation by yourself"
"It was really nice to walk around inside and get away from the car and motorbike noise.
It's a little poor with english explanations of the builings and statues, so remember a guidebook if you have such (and don't want to pay for a guide)"
"The temples and palaces inside the city vary from ruins (destroyed in the war) to well preserved/rebuilt wonders. Spent longer than we thought here, I recommend taking food as the restaurants didn't serve meals."
"Must have been the hottest day I've ever experienced walking round The Citadel. Well worth it though and an interesting look into the city's history. Currently a large amount of restoration work going on, sure when it's all done it will be even more memorable."
We visted this really nice historical building and really liked it even when they are now restorating it to its old original plan. Worth visiting.
"It's fascinating to see the enormity of a Royal Palace and imagine how it must have been like to live a royal life in the past.

Every corner and nook of this citadel speaks of grandeur, story, history and brutality of war...and every building reflect royal lifestyle.

Our personal favorite was the theater. F.A.B.U.L.O.U.S.

It's impossible to see the whole Citadel in one day and without a guide."
"You can easily spend a day here - but plan for at least a couple of hours. The buildings are being sympathetically restored and the finished ones are beautiful. Watch out for rickshaw drivers outside asking to take you for a ride - you will probably end up at a shop selling gold - and if you dont want to go in, the driver isn't particularly happy."
Such a pity that much of the Citadel was destroyed during the war. Left intact it would have been a truly amazing place to visit but it was still impressive.
Really interesting place to have a look around. Make sure to give yourself at least an hour for a good look around. The structure is quite historical but a guide would be advised as there is a lot of history.
"We didn't, and I think we missed out on a lot. It's a very large area and so impressive when you imagine it in the days when the royal court was here. Very interesting to see the photos of the damage inflicted during the ""American War"" and then see what a great job they are making of restoring the buildings to look original."
"We walked here from our hotel, which was a bit far away (30-45 minutes) and not really interesting (so I recommend a boat or bike taxi for a dollar or so). Once there we strolled around until we had to leave the place at closing time, a little after 5 pm. We lost ourselves for 3-4 hours in this labyrinth of temples, palaces, ponds, ruins and whatnot, every time thinking we saw all of it and discovering something new around the corner. A must visit in Hue (a tour may be interesting for the background stories, but we probably prefer it without one, because we could take our time without rushing through it) and even worthwhile to go to Hue to in my opinion. They are doing renovations at some places, but that didn't bother us. Also: feeding the fattest carps I've ever seen is cheap fun."
"be prepared to walk many kms on this tour, but well worth it. its an amazing place and our local guide was more than helpful in explaining all aspects of this great place."
"It is a great place to visit if you are into history. For me, although the Citadel was worth a visit because it is probably THE landmark of Hue, I only spent an hour or two there just to tick it off my list. The Citadel was kind of like the Forbidden City in Beijing but less glamorous. If you intend to get the most of it, I think a tour guide is a must. I didn't hire one so I was basically just walking around. It was hot when I visited in October 2015, so an umbrella or a hat would be a good idea if you intend to walk around extensively."
Citadel is huge with many parts and unique architect. That keeps a lot histories of all dynasties. Very worth to visit!
"The scale, the buildings, the opulence. This is a must see portion of Vietnamese history. be prepared for stairs and long a walk."
"The citadel (the whole complex) has around 10.000sqm, quite manageable to do by feet (no need of cycle), although there were some explanations in English , we wouldn't have enjoyed and learned so much if we wouldn't have our private guide, he transported us to the ancient times. Unfortunately this historical place was quite destroyed during war, nevertheless this UNESCO world heritage is a must see if you are in Vietnam."
"Ignore the cyclo drivers near the main entrance who will offer you a tour for an hour, which doesn't actually take you into the citadel. Only eat at the street food places near the bus station before the main entrance if you have no respect for your health or hygiene. Be prepared to fork out a steep 150 000 vnd per person - cash only, no cards - and check your change. There is no substantive food inside but a few stalls selling drinks. There are a few good parts in the exhibits but a lot is of marginal interest. Rather amusingly, there are historical maps showing the Paracels and the Spratlys as part of Vietnam. I don't think this will hold much weight if the Chinese start lobbing missiles."
"We we very fortunate to have a private tour. Our guide was very knowledgeable, enthusiastic and continually drew us into ""the past"". I feel that it would be easy to miss a lot without a guide. The architecture very was impressive."
We went to the Citadel as part of a full day tour including tombs of past kings etc. The day tour we can recommend but it is a long day - approx 10hrs. The Citadel is huge and definitely worth exploring. Having a guide would be vital to understand the history of everything.
A good way to spend the afternoon is to strole around the imperial city and viewing it ruins. There are informative plaques everywhere and lovely places to sit and relax in the gardens.
"It is really nice for visiting the citadel. It is one of the most famous destination in Hue city, the one we can not pass when visiting here. This place inflect the old life of king and queen and all their daily activities. It will be good to hiring the guide for telling all stories related to the architectures and the life of royal family in the old day."
"Lots of Vietnam,s history. Wonderful place. On list must to see to everybody, who is in Hue. Spent there around 5 hours. Would like to come back."
"The site is interesting for the history of the Nguyen Dynasty and its role during the Tet Offensive. The destruction requires using your imagination in many areas, but the exhibits and partial restoration help paint the picture."
"There are many things to do in Hue. A cruise on the Perfume River, Night entertainment on the cruise boats and the forbidden temple and Royal Tombs.. A few days in Hue is well worth it. drj7743 australia."
"The Imperial City in Hue was on my list of places to see in Vietnam and I was not disappointed. Bearing in mind what this city went through during the Vietnam War its amazing a lot of it is still intact. Walking around you can still see the bullet holes in the walls. Superb ancient architecture and history.
Put this on your list"
"Interesting and worth while to see once, but would not go again.

Spend half a day and take lots of water for the heat.
Entry fee is expensive by Vietnamese standards at 150,000VND verses the standard 30,000VND for other museums etc but they are doing a lot of building"
"Hue imperial palace tickets:
$120,000 dong for Vietnamese
$150,000 dong for foreigners
It's one of many racist prices I've seen in Vietnam"
"big historical place , but we didnt find it very interesting. Just a few buildings with restored furniture are nice but the rest nothing special. In a sunny day might be more interesting with all green parts of the imperial city"
Though one or two part were repaired big part of the palace were damaged and left with flat grounds. Entrance is quite expensive too but it is a value buy to us as we bought it with the entrance tickets to the tombs.
"The citadel refers to the barrier walls (ramparts) and gates surrounding the Imperial City. Enclosed within the city are the Imperial City housing the imperial palace, gardens, temples and pavilions. If wanted to learn more about this place, good to learn before your visit. Otherwise this place is good for leisure walk at the same time admiring the elaborate architectural structure of the historical buildings and gates."
"in the early morning, we go to there and feel refresh air, no noisy, go for a walk is very good. Hi Hue!"
Defo need a few hours preferably a half day. We followed the lonely planet guide and it described it well. We found all maps we could access were average but didn't put us off. There is a lot of repetitative things without knowing what they are so absolutely suggest taking a guidebook. Really sad that it has been so destroyed by war and really surprised it was so young.
... unusual that none of it is all that old due to the turbulent recent history of Vietnam. It was actually quite facinating to see how tumbled down parts rennovated only 40 years ago are already. That said seeing something of the spaces within which court life was carried out and the associated displays was worthwhile. It was also interesting to be able to glimpse something of the country before the Vietnam war and current single party state. Quite unlike the rest of Vietnam.
It is a huge area and some areas of it is better than others it takes a long time to walk around it all but its well worth it.
It was amazing to discover the Imperial City and all the different areas being completely renovated and restored to the exact replica of an era long gone.
"We spent about 4 hours taking in the grounds of the citadel on a sunny Saturday afternoon.

Tickets on the gate cost 150,000vnd or you can buy a combined ticket for 2 or 3 tombs at a discounted price and are valid for 48 hours. VND and USD are accepted.

Parts of the citadel were heavily bombed during the war but the remaining buildings are breath taking and the site is being restored.

The gardens and temples are wonderful to wander around. The opera runs 2 performances daily.

Bring a picnic, spend the afternoon, you won't regret it."
"It's fairly expensive as far as attractions go in Asia at 150,000 Dong per Adult. Once inside we roamed around but there was not an awful lot to see. Maybe we should have hired a guide but I tend not to trust the strangers that approach you."
Some parts have been destroyed but the parts that remain are really cool! I specially liked the black and white picture gallery that exhibited the royal family and court. The city is big and spread out so make sure you have plenty of time to explore it.
"This was better than expected. The imperial city is super big and although there are things being renewed, most of them are very well conserved. You need at least 2 hours to see everything, more if you get lost, which is easy. I missed a map or something similar. The 4 stars are for the price, 150 000 VND for one adult ticket, the most expensive monument in Vietnam. After the visit you finish quite tired. When we were there it had rained quite heavy and there were parts that were flooded."
We paid a visit to this site on a recent visit to Hue. It's slightly melloncolly as you can appreciate how majestic the place once was and how war ravaged it.
"Must visit place in Hue, especially if you are interested with heritage sites. The Citadel is the place where the Emperors of Nguyen dinasty ever lived and conducted all their business. The building complex consist of temples, pavilions, walls, and gates. Unfortunately some buildings were damaged by skirmishes with the French and American-Vietnam War, but still worthed to visit."
"What an Experiene to walk the grounds of the citadel.
Bring a hat and good shoes , huge grounds.
We got caught at the opposite end of the entrance . Two of our party were to tired to walk back so grabbed a tuk tuk to bring us back to the car . Funny ride"
"Worth every ding dong of the 150k entrance fee.
Slap on your walking shoes and a healthy dose of sunscreen for a half day jaunt 200yrs back in time.
Significant parts have been bombed to buggery but this only adds to the history.
Wide open spaces bereft of pop up card vendors.
Pay 5k for fish food and watch obese Koi frenzy for your attention."
"The first thing you notice when you go through the mighty gates and over the 2 moats is quietness compared to urban vietnam. In the silence it is very relaxing to walk around and see the buildings, photos ,lovely gardens and art work of original and reproductive furniture to get the feel of what it would have been like to be a Emperor in many centuries past. For me the mosaics were of particular interest as they used a lot of the broken blue and white china and i picked up some ideas on making 3d flower designs from cups. There was beautiful carvings, temples, and a lot of red used to show the Imperial nature of the buildings. You could take a electric cart or a horse buggy ride if the walking in the sun was too hot. There were however many shady places to sit, rest and watch all sorts of international visitors go by."
Spend your time walking inside and see the old building as their historical castle. The citadel itself is quite self explanatory and you can take the map and walk around by yourself . Interesting to see the imperial history.
"We decided to save money so then we walk. Damm we lost. If you go by two, you can pay 300vnd for 1hour visit, or 180vnd for the horse rider.

There is no online map i can find."
"Great views, splendid architecture, and lot of beautiful sights. If you are interested in history and culture of Vietnam, it is definitely a place to visit. It takes a lot of time to discover, so be prepared to spend a lot of time here."
"The place is interesting. seeing the building complex, which is very nicely preserved (except the purple city inside, which is being worked on), is both interesting and also enjoyable for walking. If it's hot take water bottles."
Hue Imperial City is a great place to visit if you're interested in the last emperor of Vietnam and his reign. Lots to see but it is a big place so lots of walking. Take an umbrella if it's rainy season as a lot of it is out in the open.
"Located at the dividing line of north and south Vietnam, the Imperial Citidel was destroyed during Am/VC war and reconstructed. Compared to other reconstructions I've seen, it was done very well. Lovely architecture and attention to detail. There were very few tourists when we were there."
"It is a great pity so much of this structure has been destroyed by war or natural disasters. Few of the original buildings survive, that said what does remain is a number of impressive structures with a rich history we had a guide who helped to fill in some of the blanks. The compound is very large and it will take you a couple of hours to do it justice. Get your walking boots on."
"This is supposed to be loosely fashioned after the Forbidden Palace in Beijing. If you have seen that (and I have 2x), then this might be a bit of a disappointment to you."
"I'm sorry, but this was a little boring. It's all the same.

It's weird that non locals have to pay extra to get in. Feels racist to me. The staff is really unfriendly.

Not my cup of tea!"
I thoroughly loved it - why - for the mere fact you were standing were thousands have stood before in times so different then ours. If you can use you imagination you could see how it was many worlds ago. The buildings that are there are beautiful. Get a guide or understand what you are looking at before you begin. Allow 2 hours. It is expensive at least comparatively at 150k; however hopefully the money is being used to rebuild some of the sites. Enjoy
"Large and empty, but still majestic. Very worthwhile. The grounds are immense so allow plenty of time. A good place to have a rest on their hot humid days is under the beautiful avenues of trees."
Spend your time walking inside and see the old building as their historical castle. You may need to pay entry fees and extra fees if you want to bring ur cam inside. well im visiting at rainy day and luckily we bring an umbrella. this place very big nid a time to walk a long from entry side until exit.
"What an amazing place. Such a shame it got bombed in the war. Very interesting, lots to see, lots of walking, the information provided in English is pretty good but probably worth getting a guide for this."
"It is quite war damaged but still well worth a visit, with a few interesting stories about the kings and queens and concubines and eunuchs if your guide is up to it! Great photo ops. Sprawling building"
"The citadel itself is quite self explanatory and you can take the map and walk around by yourself or there are electric buggies there for hire as the distances are quite far. Most of the buildings are reconstructed versions of the original and they are decorated with broken ceramic pieces in different designs. It is not necessary to go to every corner as there are no wow factor in every section after seeing the previous. Allow for 2 hours for viewing. & if near sunset, bring mosquito repellent!"
Costs 150k to get in which seems a bit expensive. There are plenty of signs explaining the history which tends to be non existent in Vietnam usually. Large area full of history.. okay for a wander even on a rainy day.
"Obviously being on Hue had to go here. And yes I knew it is by far not finished for reconstruction. But in the end only a few buildings are somewhat restored. Mostly a walk in ruins with not too much for the eye. 150k dong entrance fee is large for what is offered, but I hope they use for the immense task to rebuild this"
"Interesting. We had our own guide, and he was helpful in filling in the story. I expect guidebooks could add detail as well. Interesting to see the imperial history."
"Its a destination you need to visit if you are in Hue but overall it wasn't awfully great.
The place is huge so you need to be prepared to walk.
There are buggies available to hire if you really dont want to walk in the heat."
"Nice place to see Some Vietnamese heritage. Although nearly completely destroyed during the ware, they are doping a good job restoring the place. Unfortunately without a guide there are no sign boards telling you some background information."
"Good to see if you travel to Hue. Don't get it confused with the Forbidden City. The Forbidden City is inside the Imperial Citadel. Takes a quite while to walk around. If you get a rickshaw, get them to drop you off at The Forbidden City and pay. Don't get them to wait till after or the clock keeps running."
This should not be missed. Just the scope and size of the place is amazing. Make sure you get a guide so you can appreciate what you are seeing. I saw many people just wandering around and I suspect they missed understanding what they were looking at.
"Worth it even if it was extremely rainy day. Just have a good raincoat ready and enjoy wandering throughout the big emperial enclosure, all the while having your imagination take over like it was back in the history this place has."
I didnt expect a so colorful place. Its really big... so you need a all afternoon to take your time and visit everything.
"Historical site not to be missed, easiest frame of reference is Forbidden City in Vietnam. Not on the same scale in height, but definitely place you can wander for hours, and absorb the history. In process of restoration in many areas so gives feeling of being ruins, as well as the refurbished areas that provide beautiful aesthetic. Highly recommend"
"We made good trip from Hue to Hoi An, our driver mr. Huy was very helpfull, we did stop many times to make photos, for a full day we payed 60 dollar with our 2 children."
"Fantastic historical sites. It used to be imperial capital of Vietnam. A must for all tourists visiting Hue. Our tour guide was able to speak in English and had good knowledge of the history of this forbidden city surrounded by wall and moat. You can arrange for a walking tour of the palaces, and also using golf buggy for other sites. I really enjoyed the tour with our goof guide. Ah, and while on the way back to your hotel, please go to a wine shop selling the famous Minh Mang liquor - you'd love it. Happy touring"
"We traveled last year, a great experience, we enjoyed our stay in this site; I hope we can come back very soon."
"I love this historical site! But remember to get a good guide to tell you all the stories and background of this Imperial Palace! It brings back all the history when you step your foot on its ground.
The adjacent museums are all worth visiting! Beautiful Place. I hope the government will always upkeep and maintain it to its finest conditions!"
"Unfortunately there has been a huge amount of destruction due to the war and few (10%) of the buildings remain. There is a degree of reconstruction going on.
It helps to have a guide to work out what is what.
The city is a little less than 200 years old and I found it quite surprising how old some of the buildings looked - even the ones that had very recently been reconstructed.

Quite a lot less than the Forbidden City in Beijing but, then, that wasn't bombed!

I think you can get a ticket here that covers some of the other royal sites.

Easy access just across the river."
One of the main attractions in Hue is the Citadel. It is a beautiful spot. You can buy tickets to the tombs here and save money. This is a nice walk but bring an umbrella to keep yourself out of the sun.
"really enjoyed my visit to the citadel, it was very interesting to have a walk around this place and feel the history here. it looks spectacular at night all lit up."
Interesting to look around. Lots of restoration going on. A guide would've been useful to explain more of the history. Walking from our hotel we decided to catch a ride on a rickshaw to the citadel. Ended in an arguement after the driver took us the (very) long way and tried to charge us US$25 for the privilege. Might be better to walk!
"Totally different from the forbidden city in Beijing
Many KM,s to see behind all 3 different walls
Unfortunately the residencial part has been bombed"
A huge expanse of land surrounded by the ancient city wall. In the progress of construction due to the bombings of past wars but still plenty to see and imagine how the emperors lived during their time. An interesting history made better with a guide.
"Well worth the visit but there is lots to see so allow a good few hours to see it all. Be prepared also for a good walk around the whole precinct. Hat, sunscreen and water definitely needed as not all exhibits are inside."
"I spent almost one day in the Imperial City. The terrain is so vast and there are many things to discover. It is a shame that most of the buildings have been destroyed by the wars but one can still get an impression of the splendour of the ancient city. The exhibitions help a bit to imagine what the lives of the kings were like and how different the society in Vietnam must have been. Many buildings are about to be rebuilt or restored, a huge task."
"We were a little disappointed. The tickets are now expensive! Every single tomb has 100.000vdong ticket to enter, citadel 150.000.... So at the end of the day you realize you see you waste much more and what you got for( above all if you have a limited budget because you travel for a month. Thr Tu Duc tomb was in reconstruction. We know they are doing works because wars and thyphoons distroyed the main historic buildings but you pay the whole ticket and it's hard to take a photo without a scaraffolding, then you don't heard birds but the heavy noise of the workers.... Frankly we expected more about Hue, and the city is not really nice.... Only the parfum river...."
We spent a morning here and enjoyed all the parts of this huge place. We used Lonely planet for our information.
"A huge complex of buildings and gardens, the map is a bit daunting, making you realise how much there is on the site. Very impressive."
"Prepare to take your time getting around this place as its HUGE. We got lost a few times! There's so much to see and immerse yourself in, if you're not much into walking then I'd suggest hiring a cyclo to drive you to the ""main"" highlights. However walking around gives you much more of an insight into the history that went on."
There was sort of break in the middle of the day and nobody can tell when it will be open and where to get any information.
"Wonderful display of ancient Hue. The careful delicate symbolism is amazing. The numbers 9, 5 and 4 are repeated everywhere as this was the emperors number. Look always for the 4 seasons, and the 5 elements in symbolic reprssentation...and count the steps, alwsys 9"
"Main walkable attraction in Hue. Allow at least half a day to walk around. If you have a good guide book you won't need a guide, but get a guide if you want local detail and info about the site. Large area, lots of photo opps and get a glimpse of the once great dynasty."
"Enjoyed the tranquility and beauty of the Forbidden Purple City. So much history and architecture. Interesting to see the building that were destroyed during the Vietnamese wars being rebuilt. Unlike most major tourist sites, this place is unhurried and all at your own pace. I really enjoyed spending time here!"
I think in overall I don't find this to be a world heritage site. Half of the buildings are not original and newly built.
"Went here while I was backpacking in Hue, Vietnam and it's really huge and well preserved citadel with a park. The place requires entrance fee so I didn't go inside, I just took photos which offers really great backdrop. Check out my photo, I feel like i'm in a painting. The place is relaxing too and got good views for landscape photos. There are a lot of locals selling fruits and food around too."
"Hue is a very interesting place to visit.Firstly if anyone is going there via Hanoi,I would suggest they take the overnight train. It is a experiance to travel on it Book a sleeper is well worth the extra fare.Also when in Hue visit the caves which you can do by boat up the river"
"I went on a city tour and visited the Citadel. If you are in Hue, one must visit this attraction to see how the Imperial court lived and worked. There is a good informative area to your right when you enter the final inner wall that illustrates the history and lives of the people that served the king. They are still renovating buildings here but one can get a understanding of the King nd his court. Also go early in the morning or late afternoon to avoid the heat and bring water."
"Fascinating - I liked the mix of restored and unrestored areas, and especially the displays of photographs of the various emperors and their court, and the text that went with them, which really put everything into context."
"My wife and I in April 2015, along with three Canadian and two Australian friends, visited the Citadel. We had a lovely time on a beautiful day taking in the grandeur and varied sights while not being pressed to buy things. The Palace was only a short trip from our hotel; I strongly recommend this attraction if you visit Hue."
"The Imperial City has been the center, the heartbeat of Hue for many years. Although it was badly destroyed in the Tet Offensive during the American War, and many of the buildings that once stood there are gone, it remains an important icon of royal Vietnamese history adn should not be missed."
"After a negotiated Cedak tour of the surrounds and some excellent history stories from our guides the citadel complex on the banks of the Huang river proved to be fascinating to explore. Be prepared to spend at least four hours, as this Unesco world heritage site is huge. (As always take plenty of water and a brolly for shade).
A must see attraction to help give an insite to the history surrounding Hue and the associated dynasties."
"It is a very big complex, but the most impressive part is the CGI reconstruction that shows how the imperial city was before the WWII bombardments. It is a reminder that the nonesense of war does damage on many levels."
This is also called the Forbidden Purple City and if you have ever visited Beijing and the Forbidden City there you will see the similarities. The layout and style of buildings are very Chinese. The difference here is that the Citadel was heavily bombed in the Vietnamese war but it is being rennovated bit by bit and to a very high standard. The guides only really take you to the parts that have been rebuilt but you could just see areas that were bombed if you look carefully. Very beautiful gardens as well.
It is acient bulding that was built by the franch. It was the place for the Kings to live in the past centery
"Do not miss out on Hue if you are interested in history. This was one of the highlights of our 2 weeks in Vietnam. If you are able to, do sign up for a motorcycle tour in the countryside - you will experience life as a local."
"Huge place, with historical athomspare. I rented a motorbike just around the corner and drowe around it aswel, recoment that because it´s quite big and I liked the outside of it aswell, then a guard just garded my bike when I got in. People are friendly in Hue, but inside the citadel it´s quiet and you have a room to meditate the historical view."
"This is a great capital city. Definitely worth a visit of a few hours. (If it's hot weather, try to visit in the morning.) Enough remains and has been restored to understand the pride and independence of the people. Be sure to see the TV documentary presentation in the throne room building."
"Having witnessed the Tombs of the Kings the day before, I suppose this was a bit of same same, however the expansive nature of the Citadel is very impressive, as is the huge Vietnamese flag flying at the forecourt. There is a restoration project under-way, which when complete will make the Citadel campus very impressive. Included in the price is entry to the museum which is a hop step and jump from the Citadel exit and has some interesting artefacts-"
This is s very special world heritage site. There is so much more to see than just the palace. I'd recommend speending two days to explore the entire citadel as it is large and fascinating. A great way to travel around the citadel is by push bike. Most hotels can help you with bike hire. Just outside the palace complex is a small but interesting American War Museum. You can't miss it as it has a fine collection of military hardware out the front. Take your time and enjoy.
"This city is fantastic! It is quite large, so give yourself plenty of time, there is many places to buy basic water and food, and wear good shoes. You will be walking quite a few kilometres, so if you have a baby bring a stroller. Wear a hat or take a parasol, the garden areas are quite exposed to sun during the middle of the day.
The buildings/architecture are awesome, and the opportunity for great photos are everywhere. We spent the early morning at the Hue central market where we bought lychees and rhambutans for snacking on during our adventure, then walked to the imperial city. We spent about four hours roaming the city and then left via the museum and walked back to town.
What a great day and what a beautiful place. Highly recommend."
"There are two types of entry for the citadel, with access to Pagodas and Tombs or without. Going to the tombs and pagodas really depends on the amount of time you have available, as the site is quite large and also the weather (because you can get exposed in the sun frequently).
We decided not to have access to the tombs etc, and infact we would have struggled to get to them with the time available. Even so, there is plenty to look around with the theatre being the most impressive.
For those interested in the Vietnam war, there are plenty of bullet holes in the citadel walls."
Mainly reconstructed after the war but the attention to detail in the reconstruct is superb. It is still incomplete but once finished it will be a major attraction. their is an electric car tour that is crying out for an audio discription common in other attractions we have visited. It is a big site so plan at least 1/2 a day to do it justice.
"What we experienced during our vacation in the first half of September this year, is:
Vietnam (& Cambodia) are too hot to visit in summer. Our visit of The Citadel on such a dog's day was almost unbearable because of the scorching heat and the large area of the Citadel. Still, wandering around the fortification wall, canals, gates and green gardens we got an idea of the ancient royal times and were impressed.
Our advice: Visit Hue and its Landmarks (like The Citadel) in winter. And if you are visiting Vietnam in summer, the choose a cloudy day for sight-seeing, although your photos may not be that shining."
"It is huge so be prepared to spend a couple of hours, Very Nice and mostly newly renovated (but there are some parts where there are workers renovating parts of the citadel). There is an interesting Movie to be seen in the Palace. There are possible to put on royal robes and be taken photo in royal setting. We were Lucky and got to see some musicians performing in bautiful robes in one of the buiildings. There is also a royal theatre where there is performances a couple of times every day."
"The imperial city is only a shadow of what was there originally which is such a shame. A large area and they are doing well to reconstruct some of the buildings but have a long way to go.

Conveniently located and needs your support."
"We've visited the Citadal on a very hot day. Make sure you bring a hat and water. Although you can buy water inside, they charge more. Most prices inside are posted, but they ask higher prices anyway. So be sharp when you purchase anything.

It's lovely to walk around the old buildings and learn about the way the emperors lived here.

The architecture is very nice and most buildings are conserved pretty well. Some buildings have been destroyed during the several wars. This just adds to the mystery and history of the place."
"I was there in a rainy day... nevertheless I enjoyed the attraction. The site was destroyed during the war and they are now restoring it, but it is worth of visiting anyway."
It was a nice visit but the place is huge and it's easy to get lost! There aren't many signs or information posts when you're out and about! There's info right at the beginning but it's easy to forget so some signs would have been good! Definitely worth a visit!
"Beautiful site but no information, no maps and very unhelpful staff who only wanted to sell us stuff. Felt very under done, so much history that we as westerners know nothing about and still don't apart from walking around taking beautiful pictures."
"Historically, a very important place. Nowadays it is like a huge Museum depicting the Royal life of the last dynasty.
The place is huge, then it is best to visit with a guide. But it is a must on Hue."
You do have to see it when you are in hue. Its just really sad that it has been ruined. It was bloody hot when i was there so i didnt have much patience. But if there is a guide possible please get one
"This place is quite amazing, the citadel is a living part of Hue. It's full of history, chinese imperial architecture (Being Hue the old capital during chinese rule), and a massive wall around it.
During the 2nd world war Hue suffered a lot, that is why some parts of the city need some renovations (and some are under maintenance or reparation) but it doesn't stop the Citadel of being a must see spot. I went during March and it was really humid, so prepare to carry water, lots of it!
I also recommend to rent bycicles to get around, yes the sun is strong, but it is easy to go there and park."
"We've been to National History Museum of Vietnam in Hanoi and we've not lerned so much about the history of that country as in the Citadel in Hue. It's really interesting to see the movie about the Old City, which is played in one of the main buildings in the sight."
"My friend and i were going to explore Hue on foot, starting by the citadel.
THANK GOD Thinh found us before we got going and offered us his incredible motorbike tour of the city and the surroundings.
What we loved most about the tour was that we got to see things that other agencies don't offer. We also go to see the countryside which was absolutely beautiful.
Thinh and his wife Van drove the two of us around. He was very knowledgeable and offered all sorts of historical facts about the places we went to see, and also he was very eager to learn about our Canadian culture.
A wonderful day spent in very pleasant company!"
"This is not to be missed allow half a day to experience this historic site.
Well done to the restoration and ongoing work being done here to ensure the future generations of Vietnam and indeed the world can be educated not only about the history but the determination that a nation who has struggled through wars and the terrible hardships that follow can then look to the future with optimism and rebuild there historic sites to their former glory.
Spectacular."
"A very interesting day out, make sure you have a guide. Get to know the history and don't be shy to ask questions, they are very proud individuals."
Very interesting although incomplete. The citadel is still being restored so there is still a lot to be completed. Having said that well worth visiting.
If you are in Hue it is a must see very important place in Vietnam history you need at least 2.5 hours here to scratch the surface
Really amazing place to see the history of Vietnam. However there're not many original buildings remain because of the wars. the plus is the food there is so good and cheap. One night stay there is enough and spend all day time to discover the Citadel.
"The citadel is interesting and covers a vast area. Unfortunately a majority of the buildings have been destroyed and only the buildings of religious significance are still accessible.
If the citadel was fully restored it would be an amazing place and a must see attraction"
This is surely nothing compared to its bigger brother in china. The size of this forbidden city was mindblowing for a small country like Vietnam.
"The Hue Imperial City was apparently inspired by the Forbidden City in Beijing, and it shows. Unfortunately a lot of it had been destroyed in the French and American wars so not many of the original buildings are still there. Those that remain have been carefully restored using the original techniques and materials, and there is a very slow program to recreate others. Normally this would be a big turn off for me, but in this case it works very well and gives you a good feel for the grandeur that abounded back in the day."
I had read that some people were disappointed in their visit here. How sad is that - how can you be disappointed in the amazing restoration and insight to imperial life in Vietnam that can be seen here. It really is worth your visit - go and see. You won't be disappointed.
"Unesco World Heritage site that shouldn't be missed, huge so make sure you go early if it's hot. no need to pay a guide, though you need the lonely planet or something to tell you which bits to head for."
"Not as original form any more. I came here 10 years ago and it still had the values to discover, but now it's very different. I think the city authority did not act to preserve this place well."
"The citadel is architecturally intricate, not as ancient as I thought it would be but it's very cool and you can still see remnants of the fighting that occurred here. You can also dress up in emperors clothes in one of the rooms which is good fun."
Visited as part of a whole country tour. We had seen many temples etc but this is impressive. The scale and architecture is a wonder. The intricacy of the tombs and temples shows the care and dedication to the once ruling emperors. The bullet damage around the entrance to the citadel from the Tet offensive in the Vietnam War brings back memories of what I was listening to on the news as a child.
"Sorry about the pun, but the funerary art and temple complex is the stand out in the sw of the citadel. Also, if you can, please walk the outer bounds in one direction at least of the entire complex. This was where all the blood and treasure of Vietnam that wasn't French was sunk. They certainly know how to build water structures around here."
"Huge place with a lot of things to see.
A bit expensive, 150K dong.
Interesting halls and historical info from diffetent past years."
"Entrance fee: 150000 dong per person.
Beautiful place, beautiful buildings, very pleasant walk. The site is still under refurbishment in some areas but you will find beautiful and original buildings still colorful and well preserved. The architecture is stunning! You can easily spend 2-3 hours walking there, depending on your interest. It's a place where you must enjoy and take your time to seat somewhere and feel the atmosphere.
Of course it's touristic but when we went there, we found some places where we could be pretty much alone. Loved it!"
"We visited on a public holiday and the place was busy, lots of history to see and wonderful sights. Nice to wander the site which is huge, we only saw, one half due to time constraints"
Hue is a lovely calm city after Hanoi. It's like stepping back from the crazy hussle of the city. The people are lovely with a great sense of humour. Our guide was a hoot and our driver. They are trying very hard to renovate and catch up with the rest of Vietnam which will be a pity as it's naivety is their gift.
"Absolutely a must if you go in Vietnam. A beautiful residence of the old emperors. It's really big, it took about 4 hours to visit all but it worth it."
"The citadel covers a large site so expect lots of walking if you wish to cover it all. This can be particularly tiring in the heat of the day, shade opportunities are few and far between but there are a few cafes dotted around the area within the walls. Some of the citadel is very well preserved/conserved (UNESCO work is ongoing) but some parts are no more than weed covered foundations. Read up before you go, take a guide book or hire a guide as there is little explanation of what you are seeing. Definitely worth a visit."
I didnt know A thing about Hue before a city tour. Group guided tour gave me great insight about life inside of this royal palace. Defenitely a must visit place in Hue.
I visited this fantastic historic sight accompanied by my motorcycle taxi driver and not on an organised tour. This meant I could wander around and explore all the buildings and gardens at leisure without being ushered by a tour guide. The whole complex is awe-inspiring and I never stopped using my camera. I was here several hours and there are refreshment stalls for welcome relaxation after a lot of walking. Electric cars are available for those with weary legs but they operate within a restricted area. There are surprises around every corner and in particular I discovered a lovely peaceful garden off the perimeter walk outside the massive citadel walls. Visiting here gave me the impression of what the Forbidden City in Beijing must look like. If it is a hot day I recommend you wear a hat for walking between buildings. Drinking water is available and can be purchased on site.
"Maybe I am just spoiled with the high standard of western museums, but there is so little information on everything inside the sites. If you don't have a guide or buy a guide book you will not understand much about the importance of the citadel!
Almost Nothing except for the buildings themselves is restourated or rebuilt, which makes it hard to see how they lived or what the life of the inhabitants where.
I don't think this is worth the money if you don't love temples and vietnamese history so much that you don't requier more than buildings and some random pictures here and there!

And yeah, bring drinks yourself because the price is the tripple inside than on the streets outside!"
Worth a visit with a guide. Sad to see so much had been destroyed by war. Lot of walking but electric carts are available at extra cost. Combo ticket with tombs entrance is best value.
"Spent two hours with a wonderful guide in the Imperial City discovering the life and times of living in the ancient citadel. I have to say that without a good guide you will miss out on enormous amount of fascinating information, like who lived where and how and who was allowed where and when. The hierarchy of the times The Emperor, his Queen, the Queen Mother, Scribes, Concubines and Eunuchs, etc. and what positions they held and where that lived within the walls of the Citadel. Some of the buildings have disappeared over time and you can only see where they have stood by the places where columns have been, and added to this destruction are the buildings damaged by bombing in the American War. There is a huge restoration project happening within the walls of some of these buildings with the aid of UNESCO and the Vietnam Government. One building that shouldn't be missed on a visit here is the library... untouched by the American War and the Japanese it is a magical building that just makes you want to stay and read and take in the ambience. Take water and a hat with you as it is hot in the sun and the Citadel is four square kilometres inside the walls so there is plenty of outside to take in.... enjoy!"
Very thorough. Great over view of history and culture. Enjoyed this a lot. Everybody needs to see this place and understand what happened here.
"We spent several hours here, just wandering from place to place on the complex, enjoying all the little nooks and crannies that we discovered."
"We had a whole day excursion to Hue and didn't have any expectations.

However, the history of the imperial city, the dynasty, its kings and imperial life were well seen during the visit. The grounds are vast and a pair of good walking shoes are a must.

Source for a good local guide who can explain the sights as well."
"The Imperial City is one of the main attractions to Hue and well worth the visit in my opinion. The complex is fascinating and there are glimpses of what the Imperial life must have been like. Good video - sponsored by Samsung - showing the buildings as they might have been, excellent exhibits of carriages etc, and while we did not see this the theatre does shows during the day.
Overall the ambiance of the place was spoilt for me by electric carts ferrying tourists too and from. They were going quite fast, seemed to be quite out of place and quite unnecessary."
"Better map would be helpful to navigate way round and understand the various sites/buildings, a bit unkept around the grounds which detracts. Only ten of original 160 buildings remains is sad. Fortress, walls, moats, entrances all impressive, must c if u visit Hue!"
"This large ancient Forbidden city under the rule of the Nguyen Dynasty is about three hours' drive from Hoi An but it is well worth the drive. You can wander at leisure throughout the entire citadel and palace wings and see how the king and the Queen and the Queen mother lived before they were overthrown in WW2. The drama theatre is still in use today and is awe-inspiring.
Well preserved in certain areas with good restoration work in others.
My tip especially for the elderly or those with young kids is to hire one of the buggies to go round the palace cos it's too tiring to walk the entire distance. Only costs 150,000 viet dong for one hour which is enough, unless u r a real history buff then you might need longer. We didn't know we could hire the buggies from the Bus station parking area and walked from there all the way in to the Citadel main entrance, a good 800m walk in hot weather and busy traffic, a real killer. They really should put signs up for this in English, as I'm sure many people would take up the buggy early on."
A must visit in Hue. Some of the damage from the Vietnam - American war are still visible but this place is a beautiful.
Having read some reviews i was worrued might not be much to see but at least half the original area is there. I thought it was as good as sites in Japan China and Thailand and found the rebuilding element an added point of interest. Was hot when we went and even though there are plenty of places to sit and get water we only spent about 3hrs there.
"Interesting but a lot of the same. There is a lot of construction ongoing and a lot of work men and women sitting around the attraction. One group of men made us fell very uncomfortable, making comments and laughing as we walked past. There is a real lack of information and signage. Lots of walking."
"The citadel is beautiful. The gates are very ornate and have different meanings and are meant for different classes of people, something I would not have known without a tour guide. The palace is beautiful and the throne is awesome. The forbidden city was destroyed during the Battle of Hue and has not been rebuilt. We toured the citadel as part of a 1/2 day tour and realized we could have spent more time there but we felt we had a good experience. Having a guide really helped."
"Eye opening place so much to see in this city ,,well worth a look around this magnificent place many pics ..............................................................................................."
"The entrance fee was 150k dong per person when we went, which felt like a lot at first, but it's definitely worth it as you can wander around the imperial city for quite a long time, and if you go early in the morning, there aren't really any people. At the beginning, you are provided with a quite informative video about the place, which I would recommend watching. After this, strolling around is really pleasant and there is quite a lot to see, getting a feel of the history of Vietnam's Nguyen dynasty."
Have been a few times and every time i have seen more and more they are restoring it bit by bit and it looks wonderful great bit of history
"I enjoyed my two hours slowly walking through the imperial city. I was very surprised at the high price, 150,000 dong. I enjoyed imagining what it was like to life there and I had a great time looking at the architecture. If I could do this visit again I would bring a book or my journal and spend at least half a day in there because its very relaxing and also because of the costly price."
Very interesting place to visit - do use a guide though if you want to understand the history of this place
"The imperial citadel complex is stunning and a must see if you're in Hue. The main palace is certainly interesting but the vast site is worth just wandering around. We found beautiful royal garden and empty palaces through every ruined archway. To top it all off most of them are completely empty! I spent the whole day meandering, admiring and reading my way around the site and enjoyed it immensely. Serene antiquity at its best!"
"Amazing place and very peaceful. You can just imagine the imperial city in its glory days. From the emperor to his 9 wives and 100 concubines, eunuchs etc. what a wonderful history. A must"
"A lot of this site has been damaged in war or under renovation, they are making the most of it and doing a very good job. Lots of different style inside. Great if you want photos of achetecture etc
You could easily spend a day wandering around, but choose cooler times if possible as we could only last a few hours"
This is a great tour filled with a lot of history. To get the most out of the tour you need to have a guide. Our guide was great. Very informative and gave you back ground information you would know. Definitely a must see.
"We didn't realise when we went to the citadel that it was Vietnam's independence day, which is why I think there were huge crowds. I'd hoped there would be guides that we could hire to show us around, but when I asked at the gate, I just got shown the back of the entry ticket which had a tiny plan of the citadel with miniscule unreadable writing.

What we saw looked impressive but there were few signs in writing. We did stop and watch the short video/movie explaining the citadel which helped a little bit. I recommend more research on the 'net before you go, if you haven't got a guide arranged."
"Loved visiting this important citadel today. Seeing it being rebuilt, after the wars that once wreaked havoc on imperial Hue, is a privilege and an important reminder that there was more than one major conflict in this great city in the last century.

It's a mammoth site, which would, allegedly, take three days to visit every aspect of on a bike tour. Spending a couple of hours here though gives a brief insight to the political machinations that led to the development of modern Vietnam."
"I go to the citidel at Hue city, a big space. Many old buildings, tree, Eastern style. Everything the same big Park inside city"
"We visit the citadel early in the morning. We thought it should be full of tourgroups and other people, but it was queit and peaceful insite the big walls.

I enjoyed walking around and use my imagination how it has been there in the early days.

The are renovating the citadel peace by peace. I think its word the 150.000 dong entrance fee."
"The citadel in hue is very important site, we had a tour in hue so
we got an explanation about the whole history of the site from our guide.
It's recommended to get there early because it's very hot during the day.
Don't miss it, it's beautiful."
A must see! Sadly very damaged during the war but great reparations in place. Rivals any fortress or royal palace I have seen in my travels
"It's not that great. There are some buildings to see and visit. However, it is unfinished. Most of the land is grass. The side buildings are not that interesting. These buildings are full of stuff to buy with associate sleeping on the floor. Mt partner and I did not find it that interesting.

It is easy to get to, taxi is cheap. I wouldn't experience the citadel in a tour but rather go yourself.

I just hope they will finish the buildings soon so the historical importance can be reborn again."
Most of the citadel is no longer there. I found the place to be beautiful and nice to take a long walk imagining how most things were. It takes you to another time if your imagination helps in the process.I can see how it can be a boring activity but my girlfriend and I enjoyed it. We left it as our last activity in Hué after all the other sites in the city and the surroundings and that might have helped enjoyed it more.
"We had this tour today and has been the highlight of our Vietnamese trip by a country mile. Thinh is such a kind, caring individual and loved taking us as much as we loved doing the tour. The things you see on this route is breathtaking, we will remember this day for years to come. We will keep in touch.

10/10 - would 100% reccomend Thinh to anyone contemplating doing this trip.

Thank you Thinh,
Anthony & Dean"
"You can't go to Paris without visiting the Eiffel Tower , you can't go to London and avoid Buckingham Palace , and in Hue it has to be The Citadel ."
Very impressive scale site Much restoration work going on at present. Only just worth admission price
"To be honest I think is one of the least fun tourist places I've visited. It's like a big park. I didn't see anything that made me go wow or awesome. It was all just Mehh.
Would probably be better with a guide I'll admit.

I'd write this one as : can skip

Then again if you're in Hue and have nothing better to do you might check it out just for the walk and exercise.

Will not visit again."
A must go visit in Hue. It takes around two hours to walk inside by yourself. It is very nice. bring water with you! also in the outside you get great pictures
"For those who are into the history of Vietnam, the Imperial City of Hue is not to be a miss! It is actually a walled fortress and palace, surrounded by a moat fed by the Perfume River. It was completed under the reign of King Minh Mang and definitely one of the most massive constructions in Vietnam. As with any other designs of the ancient buildings in Vietnam, the design is heavily influenced by the five elements (earth, metal, wood, water, fire) and also doors and entrances based on the royalty protocols (middle entrance is always for the King) while side doors are for the mandarins and horses and elephants. It is kind of interesting to note that when you look from the front, there are only 3 doors but once you enter and look back, you will notice 5 doors. It is designed in a hand welcoming shape to welcome people who enter the place. Once entering the place, you will come to the first building where the King's golden throne is. You are not allowed to take any pictures in here but right behind here is a place where you are able to watch a short video to show you how majestic the entire citadel looked like once upon a time. Do remember that Hue Citadel was once the capital city of belonged to the ancient city of the last royal Nguyen Dynasty for 140 years dating back from 1805 until 1945. Inside this place also lies the Imperial Residence of not only the King but also the royal family, Imperial City, the Purple Forbidden City (bears the same name as the one in Beijing) so be prepared to walk quite a fair bit in here. Due to the war and also natural factors causing damages to this place, most (understand it's about 75%) of the structures have already been destroyed. However, work is being done now to recover the entire place. There's a theatre at the other end of the city and there are performances held at certain hours. Definitely worth the visit and walk in here."
"The Hue Imperial Citadel is a must see if you are visiting Hue.

A short cab ride from just about anywhere in the city, the Citadel (which was undergoing some refurbishment when we were there) give a fascinating snapshot in the history of Hue and of changes that have taken place in the history of Vietnam as a country.

The site is huge so leave plenty of time to take in both the detail and the ambience. Guides are available for small groups at a reasonable cost and provide a bit of detail for what you are looking at and some of the history that comes along with it.

There is much to see and a lot to take in for those who have an interest in the history of the region. For those who just want to look at the architecture there is plenty of that too. From the formidable walls of the citadel to the shrine to past kings there is some monumental stuff to see. The expanse of the site itself is also worth paying some attention to.

If you are in Hue and have a half day to fill this is the place."
If you're in the city you probably should see it but definitely hire a guide because otherwise it could be disappointing
Nice view and can have nice photo taken. less maintainance work at this place. Should build more toilets and keep clean.
"Being the former imperial capital of Vietnam, the Imperial Citadel is majestic and one can only wonder of it when it was dwelled by the imperial family. While lots of buildings were destroyed during the Battle of Hue, there remains a few which are in the process of being restored. We were not able to visit a few buildings as restoration was in progress, but the vastness of the site will keep one wonder the scale at which it must have been administered.

A must visit and preferrably with a registered guide who can give you indepth information of the city and its history."
If you're into history or just like beautiful architecture this is well worth a visit. My husband and I spent a couple of hours walking around inside The Citadel today and it was very interesting. Even though a great portion of the buildings were destroyed during the Vietnam War it still gives you an idea of Imperial life in Hue. Make sure you watch the video as you enter the first building as it gives you a good idea of what it was like before it was damaged. They have digitally replaced all the missing buildings to give you an idea of how big it was! Once you walk around you realise this for yourself. Well worth the visit!
The stories that come from a good guide here are great! culturally significant for so many reasons & even now too! Vietnam wants more tourism and many are rebuilding the imperial city to get it. As tourism grows & changes their way of life I wonder if their government will be forced to become more responsive to the people too!
"Well worth the visit. It's a lovely place - very interesting. I would have liked a few more information boards around, but one room had some interesting photos and background information."
"Lots of part of the Imperial City unfortunately had been destroyed, it's a shame, but that is part of the history.
Lot to see and learn from the moment you step in, easy to spend couple of hours there, so educational.
Toilet was very clean on site and the little shop was very handy to get some cold refreshments and ice creams.
My advise to read about it before you get there."
"interesting architecture and some museum exhibits of past life
also temples ....can know more of imperial past"
"Really loved this place. It's huge so make sure you go early if it's hot (we had 36 degrees). Really well set up for English speakers, no need to pay a guide, though you need the lonely planet or something to tell you which bits to head for.

Very relaxed way of seeing different parts of vietnamese history."
Amazing site to visit but very little information around so bring your guide book. There is a lot of walking involved but lots of buildings for shade too.
A visit to Hue should include the citadel but boy was it hot/humid when we were there. The film/ video at the beginning g helps you to understand the history. I didn't see any guides but we joined an American couple who had a guide and this was definitely beneficial. We also took the golf buggy round as there is quite a bit of walking and in the heat it can take away the pleasure if this historic site. We only spent about an hour due to the heat. Take water there are kiosks selling drinks and ice creams but you will pay over the odds. I would recommend to those who live history. Allow 3 hrs and get a guide to maximise your visit.
This is a Unesco World Heritage site that shouldn't be missed. It is steeped in history and the architecture is striking.
Much has been destroyed by wars but when restoration is finally completed it will be a gem. What is there is impressive and definitely worth the visit.
"Much work is going into the restoration of this beautiful citadel. The primary thing here is to get a guide for the type of type you want. Trying to solo some things are great, but expect to get swindled out frustrated, or both. There's tons of significant history here and it is worthy of taking your time. Everything is tourist price, and one of the best things is to bring your own water and drinks.
The structures are beautiful, even the destroyed ones. Go now before they fully restore the main part so you can see how much devastation there truly is. Getting there and leaving you will find the usual hustlers, make sure you keep your wits and pay attention as distraction will quickly separate you from your money."
"We had a lovely afternoon walking around the Imperial City. It was not as grand as it had once been due to the damages caused however it was very easy to see how big and beautiful it had once been. There was also a lot of restorative work going on and it looks like it will be stunning when this is finished.

There was an information video that taught us what the city looked like before and also what all of the different rooms, buildings and parts of the city were used for.

There were some activities that you could pay extra for including trying on the emporer style clothes and having a photograph taken on the throne chair.

I felt that the city could have been better for a visit if there were information leaflets or maps available. We did manage to guess what many of the different parts of the city were however were not sure if we were right.

I also did not find the staff very helpful or friendly. When we tried to buy tickets to try on the clothes the member of staff at the desk ignored us for about five minutes. This happened several times and when we were finally directed to the clothes room the staff almost threw the outfits onto us."
No trip to Hue would be complete without a visit this this impressive World Heritage site. Allow yourself half a day to properly explore and enjoy the site.
"We visited here recently with a tour group , the imperial citadel and forbidden purple city was built for the imperial family, concubines and eunuchs when Hue was the imperial capital of Vietnam from 1802 to 1945. It is still regarded and the seat of Vietnams culture and religion. The forbidden purple city is still being restored after the destruction caused by the Vietnam War. Many parts have been restored beautifully to their former splendor. Wear good shoes, plenty of water,sunscreen. This site is not wheelchair friendly. Recommend a guide to help get the best of the sites history. (If you find this review helpful please tick the box tks )"
"This is the top sight in Hue. It's impressive to see the scale of the Citadel, and what it contained inside. Sadly many buildings have been destroyed through time and, not to forget, all years of war in Vietnam. Still it's well worth a visit."
Excellent experience. the architecture is amazing and the grounds beautiful. As we are in our 60's it was a challenge in the sapping heat to walk around the grounds and up and down the stairs. We ended up using a electric car. We would have liked to have staying longer to enjoy the ambience and soak up the atmosphere however the heat became all too much
"However the ticket is a little expensive and it's been remodelated , so there's places you can't see, however it deserves a visit!"
"If you are in hue, it's a must see, but what we like the most was the wall of the citadel and the army vehicles next to the museum."
"We found the Citadel all very interesting, but massive in size. It was a 37 degree day, so it was hot slogging. If unfit or older, best to hire the small cars to drive you around, as there is a lot of walking to be done & spending 3 to 4 hours at least doing so."
Great place to explore although much of it is in ruin there is still some areas to see and some has been restored. Ignore the drivers outside though as they will tell you it's closed and offer could go on one hour trip around city for $1. It's very hot in the middle of the day so best to go early.
"Amazing place right in the middle of a bustling mid size Vietnamese City, awesome food, hotels and bars!"
A must when in Hué. Guided tour or even private guide is recommended. Impressive location looking back to a eventful past.
"We went to Imperial City and it was very hot, not a lot of stations around to purchase drinks and they charge like wounded bull when you find one.
Once you've see one old building you've seen them all.
The best part was looking at the war equipment left by the U.S. Troops. Planes tanks etc.
it costs 150,000 VND so not cheap to get in."
A must when in town. Beautiful architecture and interesting history. There are also some small exhibitions that explain the history of the place. Found them very helpful.
Great day sight seeing. We did get a little lost when we exited the citadel but did after a couple of hours walking find our way back. Beautiful buildings got some great photos.
This is the place shouldn't miss if you come to Hue. We can learn some part of a long history of Vietnam though their Palace and their tradition.
An absolute must for any visitor to Vietnam. What a tragedy that this was damaged in both the first and second Indo-China Wars
"Was such a beautiful place to relax and stroll around .. amazing gardens and was so relaxing. My friends also purchased a very large paiting done by one of the artists in the theatre :-) a must see shame we missed the performances, we heard they were a must."
"I was apprehensive at first because there seemed to be very little information visible about the various parts of the complex. But I ended up having an enjoyable morning strolling around, without any particular route in mind. Beware: in the sun, this place is lethal. Bring lots of sun cream and water. For history buffs, maybe book a tour, as I didn't have a clue about what I was looking at most of the time."
"Ensure that you walk to the left at the entrance as most walked ahead and missed most of the city.

Very informative guide.

Beautiful place to see the Imperial palace it is being restored after being bombed.

Lisa Cartwright"
"Beautiful, one of my favorite places in Vietnam! We were there 3 hours, but I will spend a few more hours, maybe enjoy something to eat in one of the gardens, walk around relax, it has a very historic value and is really interresting to read all about it. I was really impressed and enjoyed it a lot. I will come back! and then dinner in Les Jardin de carambole!"
"Though it's a bit pricy (150.000 per adult) compared to other attractions around in Vietnam, I think it definitely is worth a visit. The citadels complexity and history easily makes the most of an afternoon disappear. Bring some fruit and plenty of water so you can sit inside the citadel and enjoy it while imagening how life must have been back in it's glorydays..."
Very interesting but still with works. The library was really cool. When full recovered it will be amazing. It it is sunny and hot take an umbrella to protect from the sun.
We were lucky enough to have a guide that gave us a really good incite into the history of this wonderful place. Unfortunately like so many places in Vietnam much damage was done .by bombing in the war but luckily a lot was spared too. It was incredibly hot the day we were there and so we did cut our visit short which was a pity as there is so much to see and absorb. Really worth taking the time for a visit if you are in Hue.
"I visited the Imperial City in February 2015. This is an amazing place some restoration work is going on throughout the citadel. In one area I got to see some restoration work (carpentry). Being a chippy, I was impressed with the skills of the workmen and women.
As for the city if you plan to spend an hour here do not bother coming because it is definitely a 3 - 4 hour visit."
"Wrote about my experience touring the complex here: http://www.endeavorclever.com/travel-2/hue-vietnam-the-purple-forbidden-city/

Absolutely phenomenal complex, a great sense of history. There's not much in English, so do yourself a favor and brush up or bring a guidebook like I did. The landscape architecture is phenomenal and it's very peaceful. There's a canal you can walk along and a lake in the center.

Rolling my eyes at the reviews by Americans whining about how most of the complex is in tatters. Please do yourself a favor a pick up a history book.

That being said, if you don't actually like history or culture (don't like to yourself) then probably not for you. Maybe you could go back to your hotel and watch some tv?"
"My wife and I visited the Imperial City during our visit to Hue and were not dissappointed. The scale of the place and the traditional architecture are breathtaking. The degree of sophistication shown is as good as any we hace seen in China, if on a smaller scale than the forbidden city. My advice for older visitors is to hire an electric cart and driver who will take you to the main attractions. This will reduce the required walking to manageable levels."
It was hot as b*lls when we visited (about 30 minutes after opening!) but it was worth it to see this amazing historic site.
"We were really excited about the toyr in the Imperial city, just to find out there is nothing really special about it. A big, not impressive, full of ruins city, you can wonder around for hours, and beside of a couple nice little locations, the entire has nothing special to see. You can go visit the tombs around the city, they are much more impressive than this place..."
"After a long coach trip of 3.5 hrs we stopped for lunch and then headed off to The Citadel in the baking afternoon heat - at this point I really didn't have my culture vulture head on my shoulders and didn't really feel like walking around in the heat and was trying to rustle up some enthusiasm for this tour and gave it a go.

The outer buildings are more preserved than the inner bombed buildings, some of which were under restoration. There is some beautiful artwork on the buildings. But due to pace of this tour and the heat I really struggled and didn't find this most interesting of places - I didn't really follow the group and listen to everything the guide was telling us about the place - was following behind taking pics at my own pace. So I'd be lying if I said I found the history interesting as I didn't really take it all in. I would have much preferred to have done this tour early in the morning not after travelling for so long and then baking in the afternoon heat.

I did enjoy strolling around and taking my pictures. It was a quite a busy place when we visited which didn't help as often another tour group would stop close to ours and both tour guides talking over each other. This really didn't help as at times I struggled to understand what my tour guide was saying.

If you like your history and culture I'd recommend you visit. However, if you're like me not the most cultural person then maybe not. It was interesting to see what Hue has to offer and to understand it's history - well some of it's history in my case. I enjoyed being out and about in the city and watching every day life go around us tourists."
A great place to visit. Have been here two times and saw something different each time as there is a lot of area to cover and so hard to do in the heat. Take plenty of water in the hotter months. There is alot of area still under recontruction but doesn't stop you from seeing everything.
"We visited the Citadel as part of Vietnam tour so our tour guide was able to put what we were seeing in context. It would have been a much poorer experience without him.

It is an excellent look into Vietnam's past. It is such a pity that so much of it was destroyed in the war, particularly during the 1968 Tet Offensive. The displays paint a picture of what it must have been like but now there are extensive spaces where buildings once were.

As for the admission cost, my response would be that while it is developing, Vietnam is not a rich country and needs to raise money for reconstruction of the Citadel from somewhere. To me the ticket price is a contribution towards those costs.

Worth a visit but like others say, best with a guide."
"This place is excellent. A mini Forbidden City. It has a great Royal Museum that explains life of emperors, eunuchs and mandarins."
Fascinating place. Could spend hours there with a good guide. They are slowly re-furbishing the buildings to there former glory. Will be sensational when it is finished.
"wasnt overly impressed, one of those things u do if your in Hue, but looking back I wouldnt be overly bothered if I missed it.

The history of it is a lot more impressive that the visit to it i think."
"The Imperial Citadel is an amazing place to visit. It needs to be done as early as possible as the afternoon temperatures can become oppressive.

The outer ring of the citadel is truly amazing but unfortunately little stands of the inside due to the wars during the last century. It is definitely worth a trip as a few of the original buildings survive and the architecture is stunning. The history of the citadel is extremely interesting and there is a lot of information to be had. We had a great tour guide who explained everything there was to know. You can take photos all around the citadel but not inside the main buildings."
I would strongly suggest visiting with a guide who can explain what life was like and the significance of various structures within the city. With a guide it is definitely worth the time and money. Very interesting.
"Another UNESCO site about 130km from Hoi An and 100km from Danang.Entrance fee 150,000 Vietnam dong per person.It is a place telling the history of vietnam,inside the palace many were destroyed during war time, what can see now are sections of the restoration work only.The architectural building is similar to the china palace fodbidden city beijing but smaller scale,by looking at the history,it was a splendid palace before and having great time too during the reign of the emperor,it should be beautiful when restoration work finish everything"
"Particularly the outer ring is impressive, including one or to buildings inside that are well preserved. Within the area there has been a lot destroyed in the past and rebuilding work mainly included some connecting buildings with long halls. Its interesting and probably even more if one has a guide to bring the history more to live. For us it was however overall not such an exciting site as you per example can find in Thailand."
"We spent around 4 hours wandering around looking at these beautiful ruins (probably could have spent another couple if lunch didnt beckon).. plenty of plaques to read to give you an insight into the history etc, also a short film upon entry is worth watching before you embark on your journey. A favourite part of the day was relaxing with an icecream in the Queen Mother's compound, and spotting a beautiful white horse tethered under a tree amongst the ruins. By all means you can rush through, though I think you'll miss the intricacies of it, so take your time if you've got it. You will be harried by guides before entering, touting their services, they claim they can get you through in an hour! If that's what you want, go for it - I just can't think of anything worse than rushing through things just to claim I'd ""seen or done"" something. These places took a long time to construct & have a very long history, you will get a better idea of what it's all about if you take some time to do a little reading beforehand & wander through absorbing some of the beauty and patina of age at a slower pace."
We enjoyed wandering around the Imperial City. So many different buildings and attractions. It is a must-see in Hue.
"Well worth a walking visit, as this is an impressive place which will really give you an insight into Vietnam's complex cultural history. Highly recommended!"
"The ticket is so expensive, and the monuments are in reconstruction. I suppose that in one or two years it will be better. By the moment it's not bad it show the way the emperor use to live. Anyway if you are in Hue you should go there."
"This is worth a visit, the video is very informative and shows you what it would have looked like back when it was in use. It's a shame it was bombed during the war and so much is still in ruins but they are refurbishing. It was really really hot and lots of open spaces bring water and sun cream!"
Well worth the visit if you're in/heading to Hue - the entire town appears to be and is based around this site. Repair works continue but what you can see is pretty amazing. Don't expect to be floored by the beauty but its definitely worth a visit - half day.
"A lot of the buildings have been destroyed through various conflicts, and it's great to see so much effort being put in to reconstruct them. The information provided about the imperial city in its pomp is fascinating and insightful. Nothing is left of the forbidden city apart from the area where it used to stand, which was slightly disappointing, but what was still there is impressive."
"The citidel looks particularly impressive from the outside and the first few buildings when you enter are quite impressive. However, we had to rely on our Lonely Planet Guide for information on what we were looking at, and a lot of the site is not well maintained and at times, we weren't sure what we were looking at! It's a big site, with lots of walking required so bring comfy shoes and lots of water!"
"We went on a full day tour of the Imperial city and other tombs and temples, which we had booked in Australia. It was 40 degrees and it was our 3rd day in Vietnam. It was very interesting to wonder around the Citadel with our guide and the information that he shared with us. Wouldn't like to visit here without a guide as you would miss out on alot of information. Worth a visit"
We spent a day exploring the grounds and loved strolling between the buildings and reading about the history. Worth every penny. I would recommend arriving early to avoid the crowds (9am) and before it gets too hot. We left by about 3 and by then there were lots of tours filling the buildings. Make sure you get to the back of the city where it is much quieter. There are lots of places to buy drinks but my favourite was in the garden at the top right of the map. One thing to note is the exit is not where you come in but at the east of the map...avoid walking all the back like we did.
Only part restored but still very interesting. Worth a visit but avoid hot afternoons as shade areas are limited and you are outside much of the time. I was surprised at size/area of main citadel which was supported by a larger area of many streets in size of servants in it's prime.
"Spent 1.5hrs walking around, could have spent more. Nice gardens and beautiful structures.

Recommended it as it is on a different scale to other sited visited in Vietnam."
Fascinating and beautiful.Take a guide book and map with you if not using a tour. It is worth taking the time to watch the film about the reconstruction and history. Very informative. Takes a few hours to walk round but an absolute must when visiting Hue.
"This place is vast, but very poorly maintained. It's very expensive to get in, & unfortunately, tourists get charged more."
"Visited the citadel on a very warm day, but loved wandering around, make sure you take lots of water and a umbrella."
"Interesting historical site to explore. If you have the energy & time there is plenty to see, make sure you have plenty of sunscreen, water and good footwear. Best to visit early morning or later in afternoon to avoid the worst of the heat if you are hear during summer."
Annoying that foreigners are still charged more than Vietnamese to enter this huge site. Think we had seen enough red lacquer elsewhere to be underwhelmed by the temples here. Of course much of this is a recreation of what was destroyed in 20th century wars. More impressive than the Citadel is that Hue has recovered from those traumas and that the people welcome westerners who were responsible for much of that previous suffering.
"Its historic context makes this a place that you should visit when in Hue - but manage your expectations as the complex is not particularly well curated or managed.

The Citadel complex is vast and much of it is delapidated which gives it a certain authentic atmosphere which is not unappealing.

We made the mistake of hiring a guiide from the ""official"" guide office next to the main entrance. Dont do this, the need to ""bargain"" to agree the (extortionate) tour fee is an unpleasant memory and, once hired, our guide was in such a hurry they gave us a very superficial overview and spoiled the visit.
A much better strategy is to buy a good guide book, take your time and avoid the ""official"" palace guides.

The Imperial City is given a ""poor"" mark because of its unsophosticated management and mercenary focus."
"Such a magnificent ancient site. Lots of places amongst the ruins to explore even off the beaten track.
Don't stick to the predefined tracks I ventured off into some of the less busier areas to find more things up close and without the huge crowds.
I spent 3-4 hours wandering and it prob still wasn't enough. Bring lots of water and snacks if your planning on being there as the minimal refreshments are far and few between.
The forbidden purple city was impressive - what is not under reconstruction, however the outer part of the citadel has more things to see/do/touch.
Get to the site early as the bus loads of tourists seems to mount up after lunch and the weather seemed a lot cooler in the morning.
Maybe pay the little extra at the main gate and take the little shuttles around the outer citadel then explore the inner purple city afterwards.
Overall a fantastic experience and if you liked Angkor wat in Cambodia you'll like this ancient site as well."
As this place has been bombed by the americans not so much is still standing to enjoy. Most of the place is a ruine and the remaining buildings are renovated and not really interesting. If you are in to archeology and ruins this is probably the place to be. You can enter the site from the riverside not from the north. The exit is on the east side.
Our tour guide was very helpful in describing the palace and the different sectors of the citadel right through to the purple palace. This helped to bring things to life and avoid getting soaked in the torrential rain.
"So 150000 is only a couple £ but this place is pretty run down, over grown and generally not worth the visit. There's one or two decent buildings other than that things are either crumbling wrecks that haven't been looked after or are newly ""refurbished"" basically remakes of what was there that's just look tacky, the old ""reading room"" has been turned into a tacky tourist shop. If you want to kill time then it's a nice place I walk around compared to the rest of hue"
"Gradually being restored after extensive damage during war, this is a fascinating place! As well as the buildings and grounds, there is an excellent display about the history of the rulers of Viet Nam, and you gives you a bit of a feel for how the colonial powers manipulated politics and exploited the people. Well worth a visit."
"Well worth the visit and the 150000VND entrance. As it is being restored there is much to still be done, but it is beautiful."
We spent a few hours here as it was so interesting. The gardens were very pleasant to walk around and there was lots of information about the history of The Imperial City which we found fascinating.
"Great palace, worth it. A 5 hours visits, lots of temples and walking to do. The palace is under reconstruction but offers lots of beautiful temples to visit. There is a museum at the exit also worth it. The price is included in the ticket. Cost 150.000 dongs, 7 dollars. Bring water and a hat. It can be hot there."
"I visited the site on a day trip from Danang, which required a three hour bus ride each way because the road is under construction. This resulted in reduced time for sightseeing and we were only allowed 20 minutes to wander the site. It has been restored in spots, but visitors are mostly left to ponder the destruction left by the Vietnam war, when the Americans bombed the Viet Cong stronghold here."
"Loads of history in Hue, lots to see... very welcoming people everywhere. See the castle and all the amazing architecture"
Be careful with the tricycle drivers.. they will charge you extra time charges half way or will ask you to step out & walk!!!!
"Smaller in scale that I expected, this is a nice place to visit if you've 1-2 days in Hue. There are some fantastically restored portions to the palace, with beautiful golden finishings, ornate designs, royal red hallways, and the like. However, much of the original palace is as yet unrestored, so you can cover almost everything within an hour. Would swing by for an afternoon, though."
Fantastic site. Huge - 10KM to walk the walls. There was huge damage caused by the war and some areas are still in ruins. That said what remains is fantastic and work is ongoing to repair the rest - with a lot of work to do. There is loads to see and a great insight to the lives of royalty.
"If you're expecting to find lots of signage and fully reconstructed historical buildings, you will be disappointed. Much of the original architecture has been destroyed - though parts of old buildings remain and some structures are being rebuilt. There are also few signs and it wasn't clear what you were looking at.

However, there are a few interesting displays on the right side of the main palace structure with photos and small models. Just one room but worth checking out. The grounds are also just fascinating to walk through, even if it's just grass, and imagine the history they have witnessed.

For students of geopolitics, the most fascinating thing I found at the site was a set of posters on one side of the grounds which present arguments for why certain islets in the South China Sea belong to Vietnam, and not the other claimants. This was actually really interesting, and detailed - wish I had longer to check it out.

A nice place to spend an afternoon, particularly given that there's not much to do in Hue city otherwise. Bring lots of sunscreen as there are few shaded areas and I don't recall any air conditioning at all. Bathrooms can be quite a hike away from most parts of the grounds, but clean."
"Poor signage and lack of information makes this a confusing and disorientating visit. The best thing was actually the digital reconstruction (under the commercial Samsung sign ha-ha), and sure it is cool to see. But either the building is not there or looks completely new because it has been restored. We left after an hour and a half (including getting lost). Bring Lonely Planet book!"
"You could spend all day exploring the different areas in the Citadel. Better to go with a tour guide who can explain what you are looking at, or bring a guide book, because there is not much signage explaining things."
"the Hue citadel is vast, quite some buildings are in restoration, the ones to see and visit are beautiful. Don't forget to bring an umbrella when raining. The entrance fee is VD 150'000 for adults and VD 30'000 for kids from 5-12 yrs."
"This was the old imperial capital of Vietnam the head of power for the Nguyen Dynasty until 1947. The city itself has some amazing temples and building dating back to the 18th century but sadly due to the Vietnam war most of these building have been destroyed, Only a handful reman standing out of hundreds. I rented out a bike with my buddies to check this city out (if you drive in Vietnam you can drive anywhere) and the history hear is palpable. However it is a shadow of it former self and you can't help but wish you could have seen it in its heyday."
"I had always wanted to visit Hue and in particular the old Imperial city, btw its much larger than the Imperial city in Beijing so be prepared to walk, they are making wonderful strides in a full restoration. A fantastic place to visit!"
"We visited on a hot day and it was not too crowded. A lot of the old imperial city got destroyed during the war, but some important buildings are (being) rebuilt. There was an impressive photo exposition of the damage the imperial city took during the war. Also, old photo's of the last emperors and mandarins were really great to see. The monuments are carefully reconstructed and are really great to see. Make sure you bring suncream."
"Very interesting, we spent 3 hours there. It was a blisteringly hot day and reading the captions was very difficult with sweat running down your face! There is no air-con and most people want to read the English captions so it can be a bit crowded around some of the exhibits.
Some road signs would have been good as we ended up walking all the way around the outside of the citadel to get to the entrance."
"This place is truly spectacular, and worth a stop in your trip through Vietnam. The complex, despite being halved in size as a result of the Vietnam War / American War, still has much of its historical grandeur--officials are hard at work to restore the rest of the facility to its past grandeur.

Make sure to get a guide for this place--some are available at the ticket counter--the place generally lacks English sinage, and can be hard to appreciate without direction"
"The citadel took me back in time, the bullet holes from the war, the old temples and buildings from when it was the home of the rulers of Vietnam. Please give yourself at least 3 hours to wander around this place at a good pace and see everything. The best value ticket to purchase it the ticket for the citadel and two tombs out of Hue, which you will need a taxi to get to (rather cheap - don't book the tours. do it yourself; taxi approx 120 thousand dong, ticket for all 3 150 thousand dong)."
"If you are in Hue you must visit the imperial city. It's totally worth a visit, but it's bigger than it seems so be sure not to skip any part of it!"
"With a guide, I had a good tour. Most of the buildings in this place were burnt or demolished, what a pity. I tried to image about Dien Hon Chen. However, I dont like the room where most of the tourists wear the costume like the Nguyen Emperors"
"This vast complex is rich in Vietnamese history, both past and present. There is a lot of walking at the Citadel so be prepared with good shoes, snacks and lots of water. The pay off is magnificent architecture and gaining some understanding of what it must have been like as ministers stood at attention in the courtyard awaiting any questions or commands from the emperor. The place is magnificent. Give yourself enough time to not be rushed. There are electric carts that will take you around, but it gives you far less time at the important stops while much is missed by zipping along at 20 KPH."
"Spent a morning here, really nice place to walk around. Watch the video documentary when you enter as it explains the history well. Some cool places to take photos. Worth the 150,000vnd entry fee.

Plan to spend about 2 hours here."
"In hindsight I shouldn't have gone to the citadel. The grounds are not very well kept, it's mostly just concrete, and therei s no history whatsoever. I suppose with a guide it may be worth it, but on top of the admission fee (150,000 dong), I would prefer to save the money. There were maybe 3 or 4 good shots in the entire citadel, and the rest was rather disappointing. The pagoda and royal tombs were much more impressive."
"Had the pleasure of visiting the citadel just recently.
Entrance 150.000 vnd for non Vietnamese.
I thought that, seeing the terrible destruction during the Vietnam war as well as by typhoons, an excellent job is being done to resurrect the old grandeur.
A bit of imagination goes a long way to imagine the life within the citadel... if only walls could talk ...
visual displays in Vietnamese and English.
toilet facilities as well as drink/snacks stands dotted around the grounds.

tips: start your visit early and even more perfect when you can visit on a shaded day. it gets hot in July!!

on the grounds of the emperors mothers residence there's a pavilion surrounded by a mote/pond with plenty of water lilies and fish. A beautiful relaxing spot to sit and have a drink.
20.000 vnd for soft drink

Enjoyed my 4 hr visit.

And hoping the entrance fees are being used for restoring the citadel
as close to former glory as possible
without making it into a tacky restoration."
"Very interesting place to visit with a good guide, as most buildings were burned/demolished in the past wars. Nice video reconstruction in the emperor hall and model layout of the huge territory. Buildings on the territory that have remained are well maintained and rebuild/restaurated nicely."
"This was an amazing place to see but be prepared to take at least 2-3 hours to see it all. It is massive in size with many things to see. You can even dress up in authentic dresses and take photos for a cost. The entrance fee is 150,000 dong(7 USD) but worth the money. They have a theatre as well with two daily showings of music and dance. A must do in Hue. I didn't have a tour guide so didn't get to know too much of the history so if you want more of that experience I would hire one"
Having been to the Forbidden City in Beijing this is equally impressive. On a vast scale. Shame so much was damaged during the various wars. Still a good insight into the imperial past of Vietnam.
"This place is enormous, I only had 2 hours hear and managed to walk around about a quarter of it, I didn't get to see any of the museum areas but what I did see was very beautiful. Don't miss out on seeing this if you like ancient sites. If you are going in the heat of the day take an umbrella, there is lots of shade but you have to walk through the sunny areas to get to them."
"we visited The Citadel in June/july'15. it is an impressive site. there are so many places to see and more improvements undergoing constantly. we didn't have a guide, used our book as a guide, and bought some art in an artist's own shop.
highly recommended."
"Firstly the ticket collectors gave no explanation of why westerners need to use a diffferent entrance and pay more money to see this site.
Secondly no explanation of the history so we aimlessly walked around not really knowing the history of anything.
Worth a visit but dont expect too much."
"We booked our tour of Hue, with a guide, through the Vinh Hung Emerald Resort in Hoi An. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable, and he led us through the history of the entire complex. It is very interesting to see the areas that have and have not yet been restored. Although it was a bit warm, we took the time to watch a short video about the Imperial City. It was worth the time because it explained a lot of the layout of the site."
"We paid to have a tour guide (available at entrance) come with us to explain the buildings and their significance. This only cost an additional 150,000 Dong (abt $9AU) and was well worth it to have a guide. The buildings were magnificent for their age. The area is quite large and there are many buildings still standing. What a shame so much was destroyed during the war. With restoration work continuing this attraction will only get better."
"After being in Vietnam for over a week, touring the Citadel really gave tied together Vietnamese history for my husband and I better than any other site. After visiting numerous unrestored old buildings, this site also struck me as being super colorful and beautiful. Leave several hours for a visit, and plan water and sunscreen if you visit in the sun and heat. There are a few concession stands in the Citadel itself if you need them."
"Be careful here! The cashier has trouble with simple math in her favor. She nearly ripped me off.

The citadel is a must see because it's part of Vietnam history and an important centerpiece for Hue. Some buildings are ready others are being renovated or rebuild. So don't expect too much."
"There honestly isn't that much to do in Hué. But the Citade is definitely worth spending time in. Much wes bombed by the Americans (and French), but there is still much to see. And the daily life of the Emperor is well explained."
"this large site is a must to visit in Hue, best taken with a local guide. The scale of the area is vast with restoration going on.It has air of calm despite the numbers of tourists visiting.Best accessed along the river"
"Its difficult not to feel sad this was bombed so badly in the War, as it was clearly amazing pre War.
Whats left is a mixture of beautiful buildings and ruins, but they're clearly renovating and rebuilding parts bit-by-bit. Its very peaceful place to be and worth the isit to walk round and just take it all in, as its not difficult to imagine how majestic this place once was!"
"We went to the Citadel as part of a half day city tour with a driver. We visited the Citadel, a Pagoda and two Tombs all of which were worthwhile visits. The car air con was a great relief after each visit.
The Citadel is very interesting and worth a visit however do go early to avoid the heat and crowds. It has been damaged from the war and is being progressively repaired. We spent about two hours wandering through by ourselves as it is well signposted"
"Whilst there is construction going on, we really enjoyed our walk to in and around the imperial city. The are signs for much of the way around, so we guided ourselves. The video at the start is worth watching, it must have been pretty impressive before the war damage!"
Great place to visit! We did this in the early evening and it was very quiet and a fantastic place to watch the sunset!
The Citadel is worth a visit in Hue. It is currently being renovated after being destroyed in the war. You therefore need to have a good imagination to see how amazing it would have been when used regularly. Some parts are fine and help to show the amazing building it is. You can also still see the bullet holes which brings it all to life and makes you the sacrifices that happened here. An important part of the culturally visit in Hue!!
"You need at least 2/ 3 hours to walk around in the Citadel. I thought it was really interesting, because you learn alot about the history of Vietnam and how it was founded. The area is quite big, I did it during the rain, and it is really worth it. I did know a lot about old Vietnam before. A lot of old buildings were destroyed during several wars, but there is still a lot to see I found and to learn. The museum outside is also very interesting.The entrance fee is 150.000 D, locals pay less (60.000 D)."
"What is for me the really interesting aspect about this site is the very diverse history of the place, from its ancient structures and beautiful architecture to the battle fought here in the Vietnam war. Really do go an spend time here if you are in the area. But you must go with a guide that can tell you how this place used to operate and the history of the area. Otherwise you will just meander through more old buildings. Ps do a bit of research before you go to a site like this it will add to the overall experience."
"Thinh unlike most easy riders you come across was very easy going and more than happy to chat. My partner and I had a bike, but getting some local knowledge was fantastic and something we wouldn't have learnt if we went alone. Very interesting to chat about the war with him and the Viet Cong invasion in 73. He showed us places we didn't know existed and it was one of our holiday highlights."
"This palace is so huge and kinda empty. You need to spend at least 2 hours in this place. However, there are some sections seems to be very empty. The entrance fee is so expensive as well."
"Hired bicycles and rode to the imperial city hoping to learn the history behind this city. What a disappointment! We paid 150,000vnd each to enter and what a waste of money it was! Looked more like a construction site, nothing had been looked after. visited the war museum in Ho Chi Minh for 15,000vnd each which was amazing and cost 1/10th of the price"
"It was good to see the City and walk around reading the plaques etc, but the price to enter is 150,000 dong per person. Which is quite a lot, but that aside its a nice place to take your time and wonder around. Its bigger than i expected so go with plenty of water and some snacks as its really expensive inside! Def go back at night time to the outer walls to see it lit up at night and the local people exercising, great way to spend the night people watching or maybe joining in!!! overall a good day, hire a bike from your accommodation and ride over the bridges to the city its a good ride and take in more of the surrounding areas."
The palace is elaborate and expansive. A bunch of parts are still under construction and it's a shame so much was ruined in the wars but there is a lot of interesting history here.
"The imperial city is being restored slowly but surely so some parts are more visitor friendly than others! It's beautiful regardless though and worth a day of wandering getting lost in the history of the place! Many paths to wander down, so try to bring a map if you can"
"We travelled from Da Nang in a private car with a tour guide. She was great sharing local, ancient and current history as well as geography. The Citadel size was enormous, built in the early 1800's on the Perfume River. Having the actual citadel previous structures,buildings and surrounds on display demonstrating the expertise of the Vietnamese builders. e.g Flag tower, Royal College, Long An Palace, Privy Council Nhan Gate, Thuong Gate, TinnTam Lake, and Observatory. Restoration and maintenance is a on going project. It was easy to imagine the original grandeur of the Imperial Enclosure and Forbidden City. A MUST VISIT. Without a tour guide we would have missed a lot of this site."
"The Imperial Citadel is grandeur on an enormous scale. It speaks of a vanished Vietnam, where spoilt and sometimes selfish emperors ruled supreme. The Vietnam of today clashes with this extraordinary complex - which you can walk and walk through and still not fully see. It is unimaginable luxury amongst feudalism. Definitely worth a long visit - study before you go there."
"Worth reading about before you go to get an in depth perspective so that you can appreciate the scale and grandeur of this city within a city
Don't go in the heat of the day as you will melt and take water
A guide is helpful but still read up before you go as there isn't much in English
It was also the site of a battle in the Vietnam war during the Tet offensive and goes some way to understanding the damage to part of the city
For anybody with an interest in history this is quite stunning

T"
"This is a must see. Not only was this one of the few fixed battles of the Vietnamese/American war but it is the home of the last dynasty of Vietnam rulers. Here you will find beautiful grounds with massive moats surrounding. Many of the buildings are slowly being rebuilt, so it is a work in progress. Make sure you hire a guide, they are very inexpensive and quite good."
"Beautiful, historic place for a visit. Wonderful palaces with oozing character and lovely people. Push bike tuk tuks are the go but a tad hard on the rider if you are carrying a few kgs."
visited the citadel as part of our classic tour of Viet Nam. Enjoyed it and 2 or 3 hours exploring it. Note there is no food available once inside although drinks and ice cream could be purchased. A ponder full sight with some buildings fully restored and others still very badly damaged
"Unfortunately due to the Vietnams Wars and specifically the last where a major battle was fought in this area between the South and North this once massive Palace has been reduced to a shadow of the original. There has been some restoration which is ongoing and in time we hope this palace will regain its former glory. The palace has sufficient artifacts and buildings to keep one busy for an afternoon and there are great photo opportunities. One can still find walls which are pock marked by bullets from the wars as well as moss covered buildings and walls which give a sence of the history and age of this complex. Some of the last emperors have tombs in the area and these are worth visiting but one needs a taxi. Recommended one hires a bicycle to visit ""The Citidel"" as there are a few good rides around the area. The market is worth a visit for those looking to shop and is not to far but can be claustrophobic for some especially during the heat of the day rather find a Bia Hoi and relax while waiting for it to cool. Worth a visit for the history buffs or just for the architecture and photos."
"The two of us visited this site as part of a private full day city tour with Tour from Hue - Day Tours. We’d decided to include a guide with our tour to walk us through and were glad of our decision. While there is extensive ongoing rebuilding and repair work to restore this huge complex to its former grandeur, a lot of the original buildings are in ruins as a result of previous wars and termite damage. There’s very limited signage, if at all, and when you are sometimes just looking at a pile of rubble it’s difficult to determine what buildings the remains belonged to without the experience of a guide. We were very appreciative of our guide’s historical knowledge and how he helped bring this ancient site to life for us.

The colossal stone walls of this ancient citadel house the remains of the expansive former imperial city of the Nguyen dynasty, including the Forbidden Purple City where the Emperor resided. This huge complex was made up of palaces, halls, imperial residences, temples, gardens and bridges over lakes filled with koi and lotus flowers. Despite the destruction of the original buildings it’s an impressive site to walk around and there is still beauty to be found in the restored buildings as well as the gardens and ponds.

Wandering around you appreciate the sheer scale of the site. It was very hot and we covered a lot of ground by foot.

Our guide bought us a package ticket onsite (package ticket for royal palaces) which included entrance into the Citadel as well as Minh Mang Tomb and Khai Dinh Tomb. Great value.

When planning: go through with a guide if you can, otherwise do research beforehand and go armed with a good map to get the most out of your visit as you can’t rely on information at the site. Wear comfortable shoes, hats and sunscreen if visiting in warmer months. Take plenty of water as it does get hot walking around. Allow a good few hours to walk around the large site at leisure.

Would definitely recommend a visit."
"There's only one entrance to the citadel, we walked all around it to find it. After paying 150k fee, I was expecting more to see. There were constructions all around. They should have at least more fans inside the exhibition rooms, it was really hot!"
the citadel is huge and poorly sign posted. I only read afterwards when i was back in my hotel that the area was decimated during the American war. It is so big to try and navigate that we probably did it wrongly -In hindsight we should have got a tour guide to show us around. Investment is being made into the attraction and I am sure in years to come it will be better.
"although not all was restorated it was good to see how the emperors lived, not even that long ago. We did it all by bike,including the tombs and the pagoda. istances are acceptable on a not too hot day"
"Enjoyable. Worth stopping to see short explanatory video at start of citadel visit. Then you can prioritise what to see. It's really too hot to walk around entire complex, esp the vast areas of grass with no shade. Worth a visit of course!"
The citadel is amazing and very impressive. The temples and palace buildings are jaw dropping. You can just imagine the Emporer and his guards suddenly appearing and sitting on his throne viewing the mere mortals before him.
"It was so hot, that we opted for the tour in an electrical car. Pricey (240 000 VND for 45min) but it was worth it to be taken to all the different sites as it covers a large area."
"A tall impressive building as we approached the place on a cyclo.. An entrance ticket costs 150,000 dong. Just opposite the ticket counter, you can see the Flag Tower with the flag of Vietnam on a long flag pole, flapping away.. First you will pass through the majestic Ngo Mon gate before coming to the Thai Hoa Palace. Thai Hoa Palace was the place where the emperor's official receptions and ceremonies were held , so a great learning place but no photos. After that walked straight on and we came to the ruins of Can Chanh Palace. Now there are only two long galleries, painted in scarlet lacquer after being reconstructed. After leaving the galleries, Walk along the passageway and learn from the Exhibition on Imperial Records of the Nguyen dynasty. The next section we came to is royal residences. the Dien Tho Residence where the Queen Mother used to live and remember to have a look at the palanquin. Look around also at the other buildings within this section. Next we headed to the Thai To Mieu complex. We saw the 9 urns dedicated to the sovereigns. We saw the shrines and photos of the past emperors in To Mieu Temple. There is also the smaller Hung To Mieu temple which houses the shrines of Emperor Gia Long's parents. Emperor Gia Long was the first Nguyen dynasty emperor. It was a relax walk through the expansive grounds but relax and take your own time and learn history as you walk along. We went out through another impressive gate."
Awesome. It is a large complex and we did not have time to see it all. It's great to see that efforts are under way to restore parts that were destroyed by war and time. Look toward to come back and spend more time to explore my home country rich history.
"This was the main reason why we stopped in Hue, but honestly, we were disappointed. It's clear this was once a really impressive complex, and that a lot of restoration is underway, but I just would to go out of my way to see this again."
"We spent a couple of hours wandering, reading and just enjoying the beautiful buildings and gardens at the Citadel. The scale of the grounds can only be appreciated once your there. This site is well worth a visit."
"This is an outstanding site and possibly the best reason to do a night or two in Hue. The site is more expansive and takes about three or four hours to fully see. For Americans, or others interested in the U.S? War in Vietnam, there is some impressive battle damage. There is, however, much more to see at the site. This is a must see in Hue."
"We took a personal tour to 5 top locations, the Citidel being one (arranged by our hotel and very affordable). We thoroughly enjoyed our stroll through history, many beautiful sights worth braving the heat for. Having an air conditioned vehicle to take a break in between locations was a major bonus and lifesaver!"
"we loved it, its a amazing the size of the whole thing, even though a lot of it has been destroyed there is still heaps to visit, allow at least half a day 3 hours - wear a hat and comfy shoes- we found there wasn't enough information unless you hire a guide but we would recommend that you google it before you go and take the info with you"
Very big building with maps which don't really help much? but a beautiful and informative building nonetheless.
"The gardens, temples and buildings probably used to be nice some day but most of it has been destroyed. Either it has been rebuilt in a Disneyland style either it's still in ruin. Don't worth the time IMHO."
"We came to the Citadel as part of a one day tour of Hue. It is certainly interesting to visit and worthwhile to get some history of the area, but the area of the citadel is huge, and most of the original buildings re ruined. The building that are there are mainly reconstructed in original materials with funds provided by UNESCO. you can see a video of the compound as it was in its glory days, and explains the different areas and what they were used for. Of interest for me was that the main front gate was the Emperor only and the side gates for horses, elephants and servants. Women were required to enter by a back gate."
the Citadel is a place that visitor must visit. this is one of the main attraction at Hue that you shall never miss. i join the bus tour and this place was i the tour package. the explanation from the tour guide through all the destroyed building made me feel so sad of the wars happen in vietnam. even re-build and re-construction is in progress but they are no longer the same. anyway. you may lost in the citatel if you didn't know how to walk around. it is almost the same palace in china and korea. enjoy the history by sights.
"It is the spririt of Hue. You shouldn't skip this place. You need a full day or half day here, because it is really large. Many places to see and take photos. If you care about history, it must be much more awesome!
You could see and understand more about the royal life of Vietnam in the past."
"Having been at Hue in 1968 ... before the horrific Tet Offensive, I appreciated the serenity of the Citadel. It has been preserved and kept up very nicely. A terrific experience. It is expansive and you can wander over quite a large area."
"My friend and I met Thinh when we were trying to explore the Imperial City in Hue. At first we were skeptical because we thought he was just another tuk tuk driver trying to scam foreign tourists, but we gradually changed our minds as Thinh and his colleague Hieu took us around the different tombs and the Imperial City. Thank goodness for Thinh because the distances between all the sites were way longer than we expected and there was no way we would have been able to see as much without Thinh.

After our day tour in Hue, Thinh offered to take us to Hoi An the following day. Again, we were unsure because we had already bought our bus tickets and the motorbike tour with Thinh would have taken an extra three hours. Additionally, my friend was experiencing back problems so we didn't think being on a motorcycle for 6 hours would be good for her. However, after much convincing, we decided to take the plunge and just go for it.

It was definitely the right decision because our experience was so much better. On our way, we passed by a few buses going to Hoi An and we were immediately relieved that we did not go by bus because it looked hot and cramped. With Thinh, we were able to stop whenever we wanted to see the sights and take pictures and just enjoy the beautiful weather and scenery. Thinh is such a wonderful tour guide because he really takes your concerns into account. He knows all the great spots along the way and if you want to experience something more off the beaten path, you should definitely go with him.

Overall, it was an amazing experience and we were glad we made the right decision by going with him. For the time and effort put in the tour, Thinh really charges peanuts for what other tour guides would charge. He is a kind, genuine person who truly wants to show others the beauty of Vietnam. You will learn a lot from him as this is a once in a lifetime experience.

""Breathe & Smile!"" - Thinh.

One last word of advice: Make sure you cover up or wear enough sunscreen from the get go. My friend and I were VERY sunburned at the end of the day..."
"Apart from the royal history and significance of the Citadel, its part in the war also adds quite significantly to the visit. The damage still quite apparent lends authenticity to the fierceness of the fighting around it."
"It is the city's main attraction and certainly worth taking a look, but to expect to see mostly ruins and rubble as most of the palace is destroyed. It is quite big and will take approximately 1.5 - 2 hours to have a quick glance around the area.

There is a side gate which has been well restored.

There are various chinese elements in the design and it managed to remind us of the Forbidden City."
Anyone who is old enough to remember the Vietnam/American war and the French occupation earlier know from the news and documentaries some of the history of the site. Patterned after the Forbidden City in Beijing this site is much more. Good for understanding Vietnamese history through their Dynastic period and the interaction internally as well as externally. Suggest an guide in your language. Lots of interesting facts for history fans. Lots of it is being rebuilt (bombed in 1968). We visited at low season for foreign tourist but high season for Vietnamese tourist. Lots of interaction and photos with people coming in from rural areas.
"We spent 2 days in Hue with our family
And spent 3 hours inside citadel. It's beautiful and very interesting information from our guide. We understood well of Viet nam history and more exiting news of Nguyen dynasty in the feudal time.
Many buildings for queen and princesses still keep good status and worth to see."
"It's a great visit. Fun to wander around & soak in the history.
Get there early as it gets busier as the day goes on.
It truly is a city"
"Explored the Citadel on our own. The architecture and ruins were fascinating. Take time to look at some of the pictures with captions. There are quite a few interesting historical tidbits you can learn there. Since majority of the complex are ruins, you'll have to walk on the naked sun for the most part. It was very hot when we got there, so make sure you bring sunblock or an umbrella if you can't take heat that much.

It actually reminded me of the Grand Palace in Bangkok (though the GP is much more grand, in size and architecture) and the Forbidden City (which I only saw on pictures). I just hope there were free maps and better directional signs in English. Had to rely on my online research on which buildings are must-visits. I really hope they do a great job at preserving/restoring this site. Restoration of historical sites, in my opinion, is quite tricky.

Note that you don't have to go back to the entrance if you want to leave. There's an exit gate at the side exactly opposite to the entrance gate. There were taxis passing by and there were lots of motorbike stores in case you want to rent one."
Enjoyed our time walking around taking in all the history. Good in the morning to avoid the crowds and the heat. You'll notice all the bullet holes in different buildings from the fierce fighting.
Very interesting part of their history !! Mant building and ruins to see. helps bif you have a guide vas we did to explain it all ! Even at 45 degrees it was great !!
Part of Vietnam history old and new. The Citadel and environs covers a huge area so you can easily spend a couple of hours here. Tour guides can be hired on the spot or you can walk around by yourself and read about the history from the information provided. Interesting to find out about a different time and very different life while at the same time being at the very spot where there was fierce fighting during the war in 1968.
"This was the main reason I wanted to fly to Hue during our 4 day Vietnam trip. I was surprised to see that it is currently in the process of being restored to its former glory. A lot of the old buildings have been destroyed and in their place are markers and indicators of how the space used to be. It was, however very informative and gave us a glimpse of what life must've been for the Nguyen rulers."
A lot of walking. The heat and humidity can be unbearable. You may want to spend a day there if you are really into the history. Beautiful scenery.
"Admittedly, we only had a day to explore the Imperial City and it really is interesting (but not at the Angkor Wat level). Try to catch a show there (twice a day, 45 minutes long). It is mostly ruins, apart from a few buildings (you'll definetly remember the one with lots of red doors). Great wall paintings."
A great place to find out about the old capital and its royal family. Do be aware that most of it is open so on a hot day you will be in the sun! Probably be useful to do it as a tour to get a full history on the royals and their way of life.
Our hotel was situated in Hue city so we walked across the bridge into the citadel. From outside the walled city it's difficult to comprehend how large the citadel actually is. We walked for a while and ended up outside the royal palace to which there is a rather expensive entry fee. Well it was for those travelling on a budget. Then if you want a guide you have to pay more again. We opted out of this area and just followed the wall until we had seen enough. We walked back towards a gate and stopped off for a cold beer at a local beer stall set up in a park. If I were to go here again I would hire a cyclo to take me around the citadel rather than trying to walk it.
"The Citadel look small but you will need at least half a day to see it properly. It is very interesting and if you like photography, you will be there all day, the colours and the buildings are fantastic. Do it early morning to avoid the tourist and the sun."
"It was VERY not when we were there. But, as others have said, there are no maps or info provided. We brought copies of the insight guides maps and descriptions.

This is much newer then I thought, 1800's. The most interesting exhibit was funded by Gemany and addresses how the eunuchs were picked, how you could rise through the ranks etc."
"The citadel has two entrances, one for foreigners and one for locals. At the sites where there were labels. information to read, there was an english version. Overall, there is not a lot of description inside the complex, so a guide might enrich the experience. We didn't have one but the architecture is still amazing. It was definitely worthwhile."
"So if you don't get to visit the Forbidden City in China, the Citadel is the next best thing.
It's good to see that there are restorations taking place. Information boards were interesting reads, giving an insight into the history of imperialism Vietnam . We saw a march musician performance, that was very colourful."
"The famous Imperial Citadel is a must visit place for any traveler to Viet Nam (and judging by the numbers of both tourists and residents who spend time here, there's much agreement on this as well :). As there has been a lot already written about this historic location, here's some tips that may be worth conveying to folks:
1) Arrive early to beat the heat and the crowds (unless you like others ""photo bombing"" your images)
2) There is a charming and fully-restored structure in the northeast part of the complex, with a small pond out front that has a miniature island (complete with bonsai trees); the travel guides describe this as a cafe, but it now serves as a small gift shop with quality artworks, plus shade, fans, bottled beverages, and seating for tired folks. There is also a small display of its use as a spot for conducting business as well.
3) If you don't feel like walking all the way back to the main entrance gate, there are alternate exits on the east and north walls, where you can find waiting taxis, cyclos, etc.
4) Be sure to check out the interpretive video (with computer reconstructions of the former Citadel) that is shown in the room behind the Imperial Throne; also check out the reproductions of the Imperial Seals as well.

Enjoy this historic and marvelous place :)"
The imperial city blew us away with the spectacular architecture and bright colours throughout. You'll need a good 3 or 4 hours to explore it all but it's well worth it. Would definitely go back.
"Our Hotel ( Hyatt regency Resort and Spa Danang) organised a driver and a English speaking tour guide , starting from our hotel we were taken via the mountain route via a 21km scenic road stopping on the way for some photo opportunities and also indicating some of the historical parts including some of the '65 war where the American & their allies had setup bunkers, radio towers and other offensive mechanisms necessary. The coastal road rivals any of the Australian coastal drives we have done, the Imperial city of Hue is steeped in so much tradition and the grounds within the walls of the city speak vividly of a bygone era. It is very English friendly with many pictorial animations written in English. An experience not to be missed."
"Although an interesting place to visit, the entrance fee was rather steep and I didn't feel there was quite enough there to justify the price. There wasn't much in the way of maps / suggested routes after the initial information board. Would not recommend going in the mid day sun as shade quite limited! Can see they are trying to work on renovating many of the sites."
"Despite the heat (37+ at midday in June), we enjoyed a leisurely stroll around the grounds of the Imperial City. There are various different buildings, temples, female quarters (Forbidden City), etc. Take at least an hour and a half, wear sensible shoes and carry lots of water. Very interesting."
"This is a great place to explore, but there's nowhere to stop into with air conditioning once you've paid the entrance fee, meaning its best in the morning or later afternoon when it's not sweltering. Also if you want a guide, which is probably wise to get the full history, go in the morning because they go home before lunch.

Hint: avoid the cyclos, they take you around the outside but don't take you into the forbidden city, which is probably the only area really worth your time (in my opinion)."
Take a guided tour by golf buggies with an English speaking guide because the Citadel is too big to walk around in the blazing summer heat with little signage and no maps!
"When visiting this, there might be comparisons with Beijing's forbidden city. This one is in poorer shape due to the Vietnam war destruction. However, I actually liked this better as this doesn't the crowds and unlike in Beijing, you can actually go into the buildings."
"You pay 150k to get in, most of the place is just rubble due to wars. They leave donation boxes to help fund the rebuilding but the amount you pay to get in you would think they make enough! Really nothing special compared to other places all over asia. You get the best photos from the outside near the moat and giant flag. Few interesting pieces inside."
"It is really interesting to see the imperial city and get an insight into how magnificent this place used to be. It's 150,000 dong for foreigners. Really infuriating how there is a separate entrance for foreigners and one for Vietnamese with completely different prices!! This really shouldn't be allowed."
"Half the place is in ruins or missing. There is limited information explaining what you are looking at and at 150,000 it is probably the most expensive attraction I have been to in all of Vietnam. If someone asked me, I'd tell them not to bother. I had no expectations and left disappointed.

The only good thing I have to say is I thought the textile and antique museum was great."
So neat! It was old and authentic it felt like it could have a bit of care taken maybe the weeds pulled but I suppose the growth added to the feeling that the place was untouched and the ancient atmosphere. An amazing place to visit very interesting to see all the architectural aspects not just from outside the gates.
"its a wonderful place to visit , a whole city within a city. very interesting and some great places to eat"
"Our guide from Buffalo tours took us here and it was well worth a visit from the river.
It is the imperial city from China in miniature.
There are ongoing works to restore a lot of the structure, but definitely recommended.
Our guide was a monk here for 16 years so was very knowledgable and also humble about this place."
"The citadel offers a unique glimpse of imperial Vietnam, and the lives of the emperors from the 1800s onwards. The setting is very beautiful, with tree lined avenues and green space providing some respite from the heat (very hot in June). Many of the buildings are in very good shape, some restoration is also in progress, but its not disruptive to the tour/viewing. We found it not too crowded, late afternoon is best time to view as its less hot and good for photography. Really a beautiful experience."
Worth a visit if in Hue. It's a shame some buildings have been destroyed. Allow yourself at least a few hours as its a huge place. Really hot in June.
"Awesome place, despite being 80% destroyed during the Vietnam War. In hot summer, but worth it to see something so amazing."
"Enormous complex of buildings and temples from Hue's imperial family. History goes back to the late 1700's and early 1800s. Unfortunately, many buildings were destroyed during the war, but this is an excellent location to see and hear about the history of the region and how it fits into the history of Vietnam."
"The scale of the citadel is quite remarkable. The scale model reconstruction gives you an idea of the complex in its original form and the video is worth watching. We spent a good couple of hours wandering around taking in the scale of the citadel. It would be wonderful to think it could be returned (eventually) to its former state and it would then be really fascinating. Sometimes its hard to ""imagine"" what was there before - even though you can see where the buildings had been sited. A bit of history that is a must do in Hue."
Worth a visit but wear good walking shoes as it grounds are large. I suggest you also ensure that you have water and a sun shade as the day we went it was hot and there is a fair amount of walking around in the open. Definitely worth a visit if in Hue.
"The citadel is vast and one has to take time to go around and see everything. When I was there it was very hot, and I found myself looking for shade in every corner. The history behind it is fascinating. Highly recommend taking a guide if you have no time to read the information first. Either way, go see the place while in Hue!"
The citadel should not be missed. We were there in June and for the one thing it was so so hot but also not crowded at all. We really enjoyed our visit. Restauration work has been really well done and not overdone. It is a good way to start exploring Hue and its many historical sites. There is no other place like it in Viet Nam which is another good reason to visit. Imperial Hue really still lives in its citadel.
"We organized a private tour and guide to see this. Best Price Vietnam travel agency organized this for us. Highly recommend touring here like this, as our guide was highly knowledgeable, spoke awesome English and showed us the Citadel in a very private and exclusive way. He got us away from the crowds and showed us things the general tourist would of missed. What a beautiful part of Vietnam's history the Citadel is"
"The Imperial City can be toured privately on foot or as part of a whole day tour. I suggest you take your time and wander around at your own pace. It is warm inside the walls but you will find cool places to rest, food and water along the way and lots of amazing photo opportunities. Don't miss this in Hue."
"While much of the Imperial City was lost to war, what remains is a powerful reminder of the long and rich history of Vietnam. From the main gate to the palace complex you get a small glimpse of the former power of this country. Like much of Vietnam there's still a lot of rebuilding to be done, but it's worth seeing what remains."
"The place is really interesting and beautiful to walk through. It definitely needs some renovation to be done, but it has great architecture to walk around and admire. The frustrating thing is that it's quite expensive for Vietnamese standards- 150,000 dong for one ticket. What's even more frustrating is that there is a separate ticket for foreigners and for Vietnamese it's half the price. I understand (sort of) but it just makes you a little mad. Anyways I definitely recommend doing this as it is a must see in Hue."
"We arrived at the citadel (unbeknownst to our knowledge) just as it closed. However we then met Thinh who just started friendly conversation with us. He showed us his spectacular reviews from previous trip goers and we were just sold on a motorbike trip. He is an ex monk with an expansive knowledge of Hue and a real passion for his country and its people. He was really lovely the whole way taking us to some amazing places and even telling us the good fortunes we would be having next year. Thinh is still a Zen Buddhist and we learnt a lot about Zen Buddhism and his beliefs. After he requested a very small fee but we tipped him extra as he was well deserving of his service. We would thoroughly recommend contacting Thinh and we would love to meet him again some day in the future and get the chance to meditate in his pagoda. Thank you very much Thinh, breathe calm and smile"
"Second trip here after more than 10 years - this place needs a lot more maintenance work done to bring it back to what it could be.

Historical insights into Vietnam's kingdom before it fell into French rule and how much Chinese influence played in the buildings and architecture.

Still a good visit when in central Vietnam and not to be missed."
"Brilliant couple of hours exploring the imperial city. Well worth the small entrance fee (150,000VD for foreigners). The restoration efforts are fantastic. Lots of information about day to day life in the palace, the buildings themselves and the different emperors. Map on the ticket is useful. Aim to spend a couple of hours exploring the royal hall, temples, gardens and residences. Do not miss if in Hue."
Whilst the citadel is an interesting place to look at it lacked any solid information beyond a brief inscription here and there. Ideally a pamphlet with a bit of background would have been nice! Worth a visit but maybe do a bit of background reading before you go!!
"In this trip, we're know many things about history of Hue. Architech of citadel very unique, I had not seen ever. However, I think ticket is quite expensive."
"Worth a Visit but be prepared that a lot of the Purple Forbidden city interior has been destroyed by wars and only the shell of the buildings are available for viewing. A little bit disappointing for me as I have visited China's forbidden city and note that this is the smaller version. However, for history buffs , note that this has historical significance for Vietnam and therefore worth a visit."
"Take the best part of a day. It is an amazing site to visit, but is large and difficult to orient yourself around. Take a guide or a good plan/map."
"The Imperial Citadel is a beauty in Hue - set next to the perfume river, it dominates the scenery.

There is plenty to walk around and see here - like the ponds with hundreds of Koi Carp which you can feed for 5k Dong ( it's quite a spectacle as they clamber over each other for the food pellets).

Admittedly, I found this to be a saddening visit - as the whole complex is under reconstruction after the fierce fighting during the Tet offensive in 1968. The place was bombed into the dust to dislodge the Viet Cong and I can only imagine what works of splendour where destroyed.

Wouldn't recommend for kids - No really much for them to do apart from feed the fish."
"Theses one of the 'Must See' sites however, think twice if you are restricted in mobility, or have trouble with high heat and humidity. Kids will also be board stiff in about 15 minutes. For the rest of us it is certainly worth seeing, the site is huge and must be about 1/2 a square mile. 2 things to which out for 1) you can not get out the way you go in so don't go back to where you started from because they will not let you out and 2) watch out for the Scam Artist claiming to be doing a survey on tourism who claims to be a teacher and fills out this long questionnaire (all about Saigon which he keeps crossing out!) then you get to put your name in his little book next to the donation you are about to give him, strangle all the amounts above are about 50 times what you would normally give - Don't fall for it!!"
It was a must visit site to get a feel and understanding of the history of the country. It can be very underwhelming if done without a guide. It is similar to the forbidden city in Beijing but on a less grand scale.
"We only had one day in Hue and decided to explore the Imperial City. We didn't have much and managed to see enough in just a couple of hours, although if you want to see the whole attraction you would probably need at least half a day"
"My husband and I had only one day to spend in Hue, and we drove out motorbike to the Citadel across the River from our hotel. It was very easy to find and very very beautiful! We drove in the main gate to the citadel and parked around by the exit. It was a five minute stroll around the wall to the ticket area. There are two places to buy tickets - one for Vietnamese and one for foreigners like myself. It's more expensive for foreigners and while I ""get it"" and have seen this done in other countries as well, it is a bit disappointing. Once inside however, the Citadel was so fun to walk around. There is an interesting video with English subtitles explaining the history and layout of the citadel, and unlike many places in Vietnam, there were lots of signs in both English and French which meant we got a lot more out of the experience. You can just wander throughout the citadel - some buildings are even open and have exhibits. When we explored we hardly saw anyone else there which was very cool. If you're in Hue this is a must-stop."
"The Imperial City is huge, you can wander in here for a long time, and it changes between beautifully restored pavilions and ruins.

We had a guide to provide us with information but there is also plenty available to read yourself.

Some parts are closed due to ongoing restoration and repairs.

As a side note, stop and feed the fish in the lily pounds outside the Forbidden City, its really quite amazing to see them all come swarming in a mass of golden scales."
"I returned to this place at the 4th time with my friends at the beginning of May. Despite of having visited the place for many times, it's still impressive to me. It's the feeling of pride and longingly remmember the latest feudal system of Vietnam. I love its architecture and the Hue's food as well."
We went here arriving at 07.30 to try and beat the heat. We failed. This is not quite as old as we had thought and a lot was in bad repair however this is being rectified. Wen we arrived we were turned away from the main gate and was sent to a second gate for western tourists and the entrance fee is higher !!!! We were given a ticket but no maps and we did not know where to go from there. Information in several languages was available on boards outside some of the buildings but not enough. The area is large and confusing and we got lost ! If you can get a guide I advance this may be best. Worth going but you don't need long.
"The citadel is a sprawling complex comprised of the Imperial City, several museums, lakes, and lovely gardens, all laid out in a series of concentric circles. Although it felt like 100 degrees Celsius, we loved strolling around, appreciating what architecture is left after the ravages of time and war, imaging royal life there 100's of years ago.

Tip: A local guide with knowledge of the citadel's history is a must."
Hue City is impressive in terms of stature and what it represented in history. We took a bike tour for about VND20k which was worth it - got a wonderful guide called Mr Hue who showed us all the spots of interest during the war.
"Sadly Hue's Citadelle is still quite in ruins. The building are slowly being rebuilt, but almost 70% of the citadelle is still in ruins.
The sights are beautiful and you will get a good glimpse on the imperial capital Hue was, but the greatness isn't there.
I strongly advise people not to go in the heat hours. You have to walk under the sun for a while to get from point A to B, and the heat is really overwhelming. We went in May, the beginning of Summer and we sweat 2 liters of water in 2h30. Just Crazy."
We were engrossed in the history surrounding this impressive site. Loved the architecture and the artifacts displayed.
You definitely need at least one hole day to see the hole complex and temple without having to run! A must do in Hue!
"Rich history here, make sure you have a guide, or organise one once there. Amazing architecture and landscaped gardens.

Post card shots everywhere!

Worth a visit"
"There is lot to see spread over a big area. Well worth the effort. Some of the buildings are being renovated.
And there is enough shelter from the sun"
I am really surprised to still exist a large citadel between a small town like this. I can see the instruments and costumes of ancient people in Vietnam
"The Citadel is very wide, very unique style however, I think a little expensive price. However, if you have to Hue it should also visit The Citadel"
"This is an impressive place to visit but watch the guides. We paid VND150( AUD$7.50) but after we agreed on this price she told us that we had to pay her entry( another VND150) and a tip.
I politely questioned this and she backed down quickly and said that VND 150 was the total price.
My advice would be to carefully check and agree on the price before you set off. If other people suddenly join your tour then renegotiate."
"All visitors must visit the Citadel, step back in time, relax take it all in and take lots of photos. Walk around take the sights and smells in of the city."
"Just amazing to walk around and envision the splendor and grandeur of the Imperial Days. They are doing a great job of restoring, after so much war damage, so can get a good feel for what used to be like. Just so much to see and take in as huge and so many different facets. Really need to visit and then return to see again as easy to miss things with so much to see.
Was extremely hot when visiting but lots of shade and places to buy cold drinks which was big plus. Look forward to returning and seeing even more restoration."
Great complex to walk around for a day and see the ruins and even more to see the renovated part of this citadel.
"This is and was an amazing place A huge complex which unfortunately was partially destroyed during the American War. What has been reconstructed is well worth a visit. We had a guide and he saved us so much effort as well as providing so much information. I would recommend one as without you could get lost and miss some fantastic sights. The scale of it is overwhelming, and the reconstructions, funded by various organisations and countries, hint at what it could be like in 10 or more years. It is well worth a visit. ."
"It's impressive to see the Imperial Citadel and worth visiting if you have a few days to kill. I personally found it very experience (150,000d) for something which is very similar to what I've seen before. Furthermore, the restoration going on at the time was somewhat restrictive when wanting see things.

If you are going then make sure you go earlier in the morning when it is cooler and make sure you have plenty to drink with you as it is very expensive inside.

If you're also considering visiting any of the tombs, try and get a combo ticket. It will cost you 360,000d but gets you access to the citadel and 3 tombs (I forget which ones). Considering it's 100,000d for EACH of the tombs, it's worth looking at. They didn't advertise it that widely when I went in but maybe ask?"
"Spend the whole day here it is truly amazing
Vietnam has one of the most incredible histories. Nguyen family had a very long line of kings and the citadel and city was build for the dynasty."
"Wonderful buildings and setting, but easy to get lost due to the almost complete lack of signage. Take a travel guidebook with you so you'll know what you're looking at."
"In our opinion, this is a definite ""pass"". It is completely exposed to the sun and as far as Imperial Palace's go, this is just ""ok""."
"A visit to this imperial city is a pleasant one. I took nearly a 24 hour train ride from Saigon to Hue so naturally I expected a little more but this place is ok. I thought that I wouldn't have enough time with just half a day to explore this Imperial City but just 2-3 hours there was enough for me. If you have been to Beijing forbidden city, you might not be that impressed with this imperial city. More on my visit to Vietnam, you can kindly check out @ www.heypt.com. Thank you."
"Must see! Its was very hot when we attended so only spent an hour in the Citadel, could easily do more. Great scenery, huge area, highly recommend!"
"We visited the Citadel on a very hot day. We left our hotel early & walked across the bridge the towards the Citadel. There are lots of cyclo drivers wanting you to hire them & it was so hot we decided to hire 2 drivers, one each. We paid 150,000 dong each for one hour & in our opinion it was money well spent. They took us all around the ancient city, took photos of us at the different sights we stopped at. Then they dropped us off at the Citadel, where you pay to go in & look around. We then caught a taxi back to our hotel.
Re the one hour cyclo hire, fix the price before you start. Ours asked for a tip at the end, but we paid him what we had originally agreed."
"The Citadel was very interesting. We pain extra to have a tour guide who takes you through the main part and then leaves you to explore the rest yourself. Great explanations of the different rooms and the significance of certain areas. It was also very beautiful. The only issue with the place is that they charge westerners extra (have to go through a different gate) at 150 000 dong instead of 130 000. It's not the price difference, more the principle."
"Lots of information given on the picture boards so that you can imagine an Emperor's life style whilst living at this Palace complex, complete with wives, concubines and eunuchs. But a combination ticket for here and the tombs to save money - ask as it is not offered or even advertised. Took us about 3 hours to wander around and it was interesting but tiring in the heat. There are large golf-carts available, but we were happy to walk albeit at a very leisurely pace! Be aware of the internal café which advertises drinks at one price but then asks for a higher one."
The Citadel area is huge! I hired a rickshaw/bicycle guy to show me around for an hour. He brought me to places I would have missed if I was just walking around because there is SO much ground to cover. There is so much history at this site with much to learn. Don't miss it!
"Not worth entering. The gates, surrounding walls and moat can been seen from the outside and it is more scenic to tour around them than to be on the inside. Inside is huge with plenty of empty courtyards, reconstructed corridors, with nothing much other than the main wooden palace (just a table on display) where photographing is restricted (now I cannot remember what I exactly saw in this one storey palace, is this the Forbidden Purple City?). Empty grass courtyards one after another, leaving each and every one to his own imagination. A war destruction cannot be so extensive. Entry ticket does not come with a guide map, and with poor direction signs, one can roam aimlessly in this huge compound under the hot sun. There is a package ticket on sale at its only one entrance gate (the Noon Gate facing the river/huge flag pole) for entry to this Citadel, Khai Dinh Tomb, Tu Duc Tomb and Minh Mang Tomb for 360,000 dong instead of 450,000 dong for all 4."
"Hue is always charming and ancient, so even tourist seems quiet here. I love this characteristic. Get to know more about the last monarch dynasties in Vietnam, and also about the mixture of Chinese and Vietnamese cultures."
"On the recommendation of our rickshaw drivers, we decided to visit The Citadel ... and are very glad that we did. It really does take you back in time and give you an appreciation and understanding of some of the historical events in Hue.

Set on an incredibly large area of 580 hectares the Citadel was almost a ""city within a city"" and was the King's second home. Many of the old, antiquated buildings are still standing and there is a lot of variety in their architecture.

Overall, it was a most enjoyable visit and a big eye-opener for us. It is only VND150,000 for an adult to enter (ie AUD$9-00) so admission is quite cheap.
If very hot, we would recommend that you take a guided tour in a golf cart."
"Amazing historical site. Absolutely not to be missed.
One of the most interesting areas visited up and down Vietnam.
Extraordinary light and colors at sunset, ideal to take pics."
"It's unbelievable to have a big palace in a city like that. It is still the oil side of the war. Especially, the inner city has a lot of fish farming that is beautiful."
"An impressive place with tons of history and photo opportunities, a must-see in Hue. Walking back we discovered a gem of a restaurant serving great coffee & food with miles of attitude. They ask people to write on the wall, have messages from all around the world."
"Cycled around the outer perimeter and visited some of the museums. To enter the inner areas was at a cost of 150,000.00 per person so we decided against it due to budget constraints."
"This is a huge place and Many of the buildings that were destroyed during the war are being rebuilt over a 25yr renovation project. We visited this as part of a Hue City day tour that also visited 4 other sites, so only had 1.5hrs guided tour. It was great to have the guide as his knowledge of Hue's history and Command of English were great. the site is so large that a half day here would be good."
We visited this attraction with our excellent guide who led us trough the various chambers and houses giving us an insight into the life of the people who had lived there. The restoration works are bringing this splendid palace back to its former glory.
"More expensive than any single royal tomb, but less impressive if more massive. Be sure to visit the royal reading room!"
This city is impressive by itself and the movie showed explain it very well. We found that it can be a better experience with more signs to guide you in the city. At least a half day is needed.
Absolutely awesome old place to visit just needed more time to wander around. Something different at every turn make sure your camera is fully charged for this visit
"we do not like the way to visit the Imperial City, it is too far from the bus stop to Ngo Mon (noon gate / or main entrance), some of the old visitors could not walk from the bus to the inside of Imperial city..(the buggy car is to expensive for 1 0r 2 people to have a private one. If they visit this site, they must pay high fees for entrance (150,000 VND/ person) and buggy car (150,000vnd/ way x 2 = 300,000vnd). The management should think how the old tourist can visit it easily and do it by the cheaper way..."
Like many places that have been reconstructed you are left with mixed feelings! The buildings are beautiful but seldom original. Nonetheless and interesting site to visit.
"Take water, hats and stroll around this enchanting Citadel. Some in ruins but some delightful renovations. Very exposed tho' so take some sun protection. Teeny café near the 'gardens'.An absolute 'MUST See' in Hue."
I spent several hours touring the Citadel. While I had a guide you can certainly enjoy the beautiful landscaping and buildings without one. The descriptions are in Vietnamese and English and are quite informative.
"not only from a historic point of view, but from a visual one, it was really beautiful. we read up on the history and enjoyed teh buildings and architecture, a must see."
"Wander the expansive grounds, try to get into the kiln works where they are making all the tile work for the ongoing renovations (pretend you don't understand the keep- out sign in VNese, which is probably true!), climb the walls, get photographed in old costumes--there's lots to do here. If you've seen the movie Indochine, you may stumble across a courtyard that I think was used in the film in the assassination scene, and if you see the History channel video about the battle for Hue during the Tet offensive of 1968, you get a sense of how the imperial city was involved. It's an oasis of quiet in the busy city and a good place to see how the royals lived during the almost 150 years that Hue was the capitol of Vietnam, until 1945."
"The scale , history & architecture of the Citadel is truly staggering . This place took 20 Years and you can see why as its over 500 acres with originally 150 + buildings before war ravaged it .

They are making a real effort to restore & refurbish some existing structures . There a few buildings untouched with the odd old bullet hole!

If we hadn't of had the tour guide we would have struggle . Take plenty of water & sun cream as lots of large open spaces so don't expect any A/C."
"this sprawling complex of official rooms, temples, residences, garden (fantastic bonsai) truly is spellbinding and transports you to a different time zone. Sadly the complex suffered bombing and has been painstakingly restored (work still continues) The residence of the mother was the coolest of the lot.

We used the lonely planet to get more info, about the must see buildings. It would have been nice to get some official broucher or an audio guided tour, which one could do in one's pace. So certainly see the potential.

The foodstalls are horribly overpriced, so please bring your own snacks and water.

This will easily take 3-5 hours on a slow relaxed pace."
"This is a beautiful palace that was ravaged by war. But the Vietnamese government is investing money to rebuild parts of the palace to reflect its former glory. Do take your time and walk around the palace (maybe with an umbrella for the sun-averse), imagining the glory of the palace.

I only wish some tourists put their trash in the bins instead of leaving them on the window ledge or throwing them on the ground."
"This is the original place for royal families in Vietnam in the old times, through their bad days and hay days. Therefore, it has the Vietnamese spirit in every corner, around every antiques. If you love to explore the culture of Vietnam, this is a must see. Event to a local like me, it still turns out to be very informative.
To be honest, I do not admire its beauty the most, I appreciate its cultural and historical meaning.
Very hot and sunny during summer days, so it's good to bring along a hat or an umbrella. Buying combo ticket with other tombs will save you a considerable sum."
Entry is 150.000 vnd which is quite pricey for Vietnamese standards but still worth the visit if you like historical sites. The area inside the citadel is huge with lots of areas.
"first we saw only from outside in the night which was deeply impressive, trip on the next day was also nice, only the burning of the waste during the opening hours inside the citadel was really discturbing"
"It's an interesting place with a lot to see but not much info in English is given. You can hire a tour guide but it's not cheap, but might be worth it. Make sure to bring a lot of water because everything within the imperial city is very expensive.
Entrance fee is 150.000 dong, which I thought is too much, considering you have to pay extra to see the tombs and some other stuff....
Altogether worth a trip though."
HUGE! Fantastic glimpse into the wealth and grandeur of the imperial age. Work is continuing to restore and the grounds are very impressive. Prepare to walk as the footprint just goes on and on (the most memorable aspect of the site in my opinion). Some of the lawns need a tidy up to give full effect but minor issue overall. Not to be missed if you are in Central. Vietnam
"Beautiful area in nclueing the purple city, some great photographic opportunity s, down side is that being such an important historical area in Vietnamese cultural history you would think they would keep the lawns and gardens a bit better maintained."
"We went to the citadel by bicycle organised by selective Asia. This a fantastic way to get around the city. You park your bicycle outside the citadel which is looked after by an attendant. You could even leave your helmet on your bike without fear of it being stolen. We had an English speaking guide that did make a difference. The citadel is an interesting and worthwhile stop on your visit to Hue.
It is and has been restored from the damage over the years. We heard people say other equivalent sites in other countries were more impressive but as part of Vietnams history this was worth seeing and appreciative of the culture"
"I went to this place for this popular festival season is a great place quiet and there are many temples, cool fresh air and everyone is very hospitable, recommend coming here"
We spent a morning walking through the Imperial City. The place is enormous and it takes a long time to walk through the different areas. If you are into photography I would strongly suggest bringing a nice camera along and shoot away until your heart in comtempt.
"Its relatively impressive and constantly being renovated so things should continue to improve. There are some interesting sights but on the whole is a bit underwhelming. Definitely worth a visit bit a half day is plenty to take it all in. Hue is a great city too, very relaxed."
We had a guided tour and found the history of the city and the citadel to be really interesting. We were interested to notice all the renovation work which is ongoing.
"We visited the citadel during our time in Hue and it was a great 1-hour walk. The citadel is beautiful even though a lot of the buildings are still just ruins.
The only downside is that 150,000VND is definitely too much for this place."
"Great grounds with plenty of walking with one getting a full workout with the walking! I had a Fitbit on and sure did more than the recommendation of steps for the day!
Take in food/nibbles and drink as you will need them!"
"a little expensive but worth the money. you can easily spend 3hours walking around the huge grounds, reading and learning all about it. even if your not into this kind of thing, the buildings are still worth going to see"
"In spite of its sadly incomplete state, the restored buildings here summon up former days of Imperial grandness and the lost beauty of this former capital. Don't miss the cultural show at the National Theatre (check times in advance as these do seem to change). We were glad we hired a guide who filled us in on the history of the various Emperors and other court figures. You can book a licensed guide at travel agents or maybe at your hotel. The cost is so reasonable (maybe $7 - 8 US) that we gave him a big tip."
"Poor signage delayed our entry as we were set upon by rickshaw drivers who wanted to drive us round a for an hour outside the citadel. We met other tourists outside trying to find a way in which was cold comfort. Some great things to see inside but too spread out and not enough attraction in each building to warrant walking in the heat. Rooms containing framed photos and videos on repeat not really worth the walk. You can hire an electric car but very expensive.
Restorations should concentrate on preserving what exists rather than re building more capacity that cannot be filled with worthwhile contributions. While we were on site we walked into a well camouflaged 'Antique shop' that was selling repro items. Not a good image. Museum worth a look and it is 5 minutes form the East gate exit."
"We rented 2 scooters and an English speaking guide. This is the best way to visit Hue. Freedom to move around, cooler and easiness. Our guide biker was excellent (he studied history) and did a fantastic job. He was very careful driver too. Contact Thuan at Hue Top Gear - 01626939054 - or email tnhamhoc3443@gmail.com. And ask him to organize your tour."
"If you don't have guide, you would feel bored. We got a lot of fun information from the guide. The Citadel is beautiful bit it was destroyed much.
You should be prepared to walk a lot though and it's hot on summer. Coming early morning is better"
Sad because of the extent of destruction. What remains is indicative of the grandeur that once existed. Restoration is very admirable. The information was insightful into the imperial life.
"It is very big so to visit it you need at least 2 hours.
Beautiful. If u are in Hue it is a must to visit it!!!"
"We went here with a guide book but got terribly lost anyway, we eventually found all the sites though and it was a lovely place to see especially the library and the temple. it is alot of ground to cover if you want to see everything so be prepared. There was also a festival happening at the time we were there which made for a good atmosphere."
"Lots of different types of buildings to see (temples, residences, halls, a theater & a library). Be prepared to walk a lot though. I went in May & wished I had started earlier in the morning as there is quite a bit of walking in the direct sun. Could use more signage & descriptions."
"Just wandering around the walled garden was a lovely way to spend the afternoon. The palaces were interesting from a historical perspective, but it's not quite the same as some of the really ancient monuments that can be found in the region. Nevertheless, the flower gardens were very pretty and there were many opportunities for beautiful portraits if you want to have a picture to show people back home."
Much more impressive than I was expecting. Lots of history and very interesting. Defiantly worth the visit.
Loved it here. They are trying to rebuild the parts that were destroyed and there are mixed views on this. Personally I would like to see more buildings restored. Definitely worth a visit.
"I would recommend getting there early , I think they open around 7 . You can take a tour guide paying around 150,000 VND , in addition to your entrance fee . The guided tour lasts around 45 mins or so. However it is a bit rushed , if your like me and like to take pictures. We spent at least another hour there after the tour walking around .

Our entrance ticket also got us into another museum and at the exit of the citadel there were buggies that shuttle you to the museum free of charge.

Worth the visit if your in Hue."
This is a very big but serene site. You can walk around and visit the different 'temples' like the Tinh Minh building.
"It is a must see ... Lots of walking ....could be better signposted it is so big ... Me my daughter enjoyed the day ..,!!!lit of ancient history ..."
"This is something you really must do as it is part and parcel of the history of Hue. Wonderful French restaurant at the far exit, leading into the city. Askfor directions"
Nice place to walk around in and see the set up of ancient times! Many areas are still being repaired or rebuilt. Be ready to walk though.
"Quite a stunning place, being renovated slowly. Such a pity it was bombed during the war. The renovations are being carried out tastefully, and though it was very, very hot the day we visited, we were able to get some shade here and there. A worthwhile visit on the Perfume River."
"The whole site was brilliant. It gave us an excellent insight into some of the most important periods of Vietnam's history.
The whole imperial complex is massive so expect to spend a full day there if you want to take your time to enjoy it.
Definitely recommended and worth visiting!"
The Citadel is under going extensive restoration since the end of the war where it saw heavy damage. You can get a good sense of what the place was like in past times and the information provided is informative.
"I did enjoy my visit and would not want anyone who visits Hue to miss it. That said, I thought it left a lot to be desired. (Unfortunately if you have seen the Forbidden City in Beijing, it doesn't compare favourably.)
It was expensive (relatively, for Vietnam) and the route for sight-seeing was not well laid out or indicated. There was also very little in the way of information in English signage. So unless you pay extra for a guide, you are literally 'on your own'. It is a large site, so there is much walking and steps, not much shade outside, and not accessible for those with walking difficulties.
It is being restored, in places well and in others not. But it is a slow process and much is still unrestored. Staff were not always friendly. Loos were few and far between. And too many trinket-sellers in the proximity: spoils the sense of majesty."
Utterly fascinating. I had no idea of its expanse and even the reconstructed areas are highly impressive.
"this is our second visit and as good as our first. This interesting and place of historical interest is a must when in Hue. However, chose a cooler part of the day to visit as it was very hot and humid when we visited.
Lots to see and learn about Vietnam royalty and history."
"Don't come here expecting a ""wow"" attraction. Much of this place was destroyed during the war and although there's a lot of refurbishment going on it's hard to get an appreciation of what it was really like. There is very little English commentary or signs so I wouldn't recommend wandering on your own without some prior reading. The touts who hang around the outside of the Citadel are annoying but to be expected."
"The site itself has much to offer but is spoiled by the awful manner in which any guidance is organised. No clear directions for anyone on foot, either from town or to find the entry. Then when in the Citadel it is a trial to get out again! The site itself is interesting although there is much restorative work to do but given the damage done here in the American war this is understandable. What was less easy to comprehend was how hostile the staff were in their manner given that visitors must be its lifeblood! So much more could be made of this."
"This is one of the best and most enjoyable visits I have ever made to a historic site.

It isn't in the best condition in places (it is being restored slowly), nor is there a huge amount of information to read or things to do, but it is a great place to be.

The site is massive, so it is easy to wander off and explore by yourselves.

It is a very peaceful and interesting site to visit."
"We spent a few hours here walking around the citadel and it really is like stepping back in time. Parts of the citadel are ruins, but the rest is maintained very well, and is very respectful to the history of the area. Definitely worth seeing whilst in Hue!"
"We first visit the imperial city 12 years ago and we had the place to ourselves. The coach dropped us outside and we walked around admiring the huge fish in the moat but there was little else there Much of the commentary then was about how it was bombed during the war and why. There was very little left to see.
Come forward 12 years and the place was crowded with lots of tourist venders outside with a distance to walk from a bus park. Inside tourists everywhere and parts of the place had been rebuilt. Extremely well rebuilt but the guides did not admit it was all new until I commented upon it. I can understand why some rebuilding has taken place but the rebuilding should be acknowledged.
There was an even longer walk from the exit back to the coach park.
Very little adaptations for disabled people."
Take you back to visualize how the royal lived and ruled the place. UNESCO's restoration work is fabulous
"The Citadel is a must do in Hue. I recommend a guided tour to fully understand the grounds. Constructed similarly to the Forbidden City in Beijing, the Citadel suffered significant damage during the Vietnam war with areas being reconstructed."
Its a lot of walking but if you allow enough time its worth it. Lots of history and interesting daily customs. Take a guide or else all that you'll see is a lot of old buildings.
"THe entrance fee is around £5 (150,000 dongs / $8). This is not worth it for what you see at all. It's more expensive than Beijing's Forbidden City, which it is similar to, except most of it still being rebuilt.

That's not to write it off completely. It is very interesting just over priced for what it is."
"Private tour guide was great in small numbers, dislike very humid a this time of the year walked up many stairs can take it out of you."
You need to put aside a whole day for this excursion. There were big electric carts to run around in that were well worth the extra money as it is a huge walk and as it was very hot it was very tiring.
"Best to go with someone who can tell you of the history around the Citidal to really get the understanding of the life and times back then. They are doing a good job at restoring the site. Take water and a hat, go,early before it gets to hot."
"hue imperial city is a must visit place, it is quite big & including lot of diff style diff building. but summer time is quite hot. but good for visit"
"On a day tour, we went here and glad we did. It's my first time to see any such place in Asia and the video in the throne building is very good to watch to get a good understanding of what this site was once like.

3 buildings are still standing that survived the bombing and they are renovating many others. Glad to see such work being done.

In the theatre you can watch music displays. We didn't get to see it, but would have liked to."
"The citadel took 28 years to build, I expect tthe rebuild will take twice as long. A lot is being rebuilt but there is still enough to see that is of interest in this huge complex. Entering through the main gate between two ponds and then a small square in front of the still standing Royal throne room where the King met his mandarins and visiting dignitaries.

To get a better picture of what the Citadel looked like before the destruction in the Vietnam war it is useful to see the short film and model of the complex of how it once looked . After the film proceed to the small photographic museum and the forbidden palace area where a lot of the destruction took place. Only the library and the theatre survived the war. To really get the best out of any visit here you need a guide to explain the history. Our guide was excellent and I came away with a better understanding of this huge complex.

If you found the review helpful please let me know any feedback is always welcomed."
"This is a world heritage site, served as a fortress for Nguyen dynasty from the early 1800s to 1945. Many parts still require renovation, but worth seeing. The first walled Citadel has inside a second enclosure, ""Imperial city"", within it is a third one called ""forbidden city"". There is a photo exhibition which shows you the ""before"" and ""after"" pictures of renovated buildings/monuments which make you appreciate the beauty of this place. If it wasn't for our tour guide, we would not have learned about stories like - the second Nguyen king, Minh Mang, who ruled from 1820 to 1841, had 300 wives and concubines, and fathered 142 children - and many more."
"I find it rich to read 1-star reviews by Americans, whose military helped destroy this place along with the Vietnamese.

I have visited this place many times since 1995 and there is restoration work going on, which costs money."
When one ponders how long this has existed and what it went through during the Tet offensive during the Vietnam war it is magnificent that it still exists. That is does is a testament to the American military.
"Although best known for the nice architecture it has some lovely gardens and is like a really nice park. Great for people who want to get away from the crowd.
Really big site and best to be seen when not so hot, before 10.00 or after 15.00..."
"Sprawling complex of buildings, UNESCO world heritage listed, which is the cultural/spiritual/religious heart of Viet Nam. Certainly worth spending time exploring the buildings, though strongly advise having a guide to help you understand the history/key characters that were involved in the city's story. Interesting to see the conservation in practice."
After upteen dozen temples etc the Citadel was great and the fact that people still live within the citadel is amazing.................the structure and history behind it understable...history far beyond us in Australia should have pent more time in Hoi An
"I was expecting rack and ruin from all the reviews and official write ups. It is not Beijing and the Forbidden City and yes quite a bit is missing, but the restoration they have done is great. They have plenty of information posters on each of the emperors. We really enjoyed our visit - just try to avoid the height of summer and midday! The Lonely Planet guide has some good info, but if you can, shell out for the guides as they are very knowledgeable - wished we had. Foreigners pay slightly more than locals, which I have no problem with as it is designed to encourage the locals to be interested in their heritage. Saying that, at 150,000 d I would suggest that was the right price."
"I really wanted to see The Citadel, especially since I had read about how much repair has been done since the war. It is a very popular place. There are large tour groups everywhere and it is easy to get separated from your group. Our bus dropped us off quite a ways away so by the time we got there I was already hot and tired. It is a beautiful site, but I think I would have enjoyed it much more had I gone on my own instead of with a group."
The citadel of Hue is a beautiful display of how the emperor of this country spend his days in wealth and fortune. Although heavily damaged during the American War - during which many buildings were lost - this UNCESCO site is very worth wile. Due to the international community many buildings are nowadays restored although restorations are an un-going proces. When in Vietnam this is definitely a must visit.
A shame it is not complete due to the war. that said it is still a good day to walk around and see how impressive it still is.
Very very sad that the war left so many marks on this historic place. Still a lot to see but the overall condition of the grounds are appalling. The mean building with the emperors throne has a roof that was leaking water due to rain! Roads were not well maintained with a water pools everywhere. Still there are beautiful buildings and hallways to be admired. But it doesn't come close to the forbidden city of Beijing. Worth a visit but temper your expectations.
.....but not a good enough reason to go there. Get a private guide - too hot and sticky to be in a large group. Interesting history - but you can read about it if you are so disposed!! Highlight was Buddhist monks commemorating the 3rd anniversary of the death of the head of the pagoda.
"This is a vast site and the Imperial City its highlight. Unhappily, the damage inflicted upon it, particularly during the Tet Offensive, is enormous, but it remains a strangely tranquil and beautiful place, with much sensitive restoration underway. Inevitably, we had to dodge a Hue cloudburst (Hue seems to suffer from a nasty micro-climate) but at least this meant that only a few tourists were roaming the massive complex.

N.B. There is a particularly pernicious scam operating within the Citadel just outside the main gate of the Imperial Palace. When you enter the Citadel through a short tunnel from the south you arrive about 100 metres from the main entrance of the Palace. You will then be pounced on by the guys who operate the cyclos. They will tell you that the Imperial Palace is closed for an hour, and that you should hop in a cyclo for a corresponding period. They lie. Fortunately, we could see that, away to our left, small groups of tourists were entering the Palace, so we declined the spurious offer and headed towards the entrance which was not, of course, closed. As we walked away from the Cyclo guys they became abusive, but as I can't speak Vietnamese and their English was limited, no bother."
Great history wondering around this site. Some well preserved buildings and lost to wonder around in. Come early it's hot.
"Booked this as part of a group tour, enjoyed the history behind the place. Despite it being torrential rain still plenty of places to shelter on the tour around, worth getting a tour guide to explain the various buildings along the way, don't under estimate the size of this place its vast!"
"We were accompanied by our guide who took a great deal of trouble to explain everything about the history of the Citadel and subsequent 1968 TET offensive which ended up destroying much of it. Quite a lot of the buildings are being restored, very slowly, by various countries which will show us in due course the magnificance of the structures. A large area to visit but well worth the effort."
"Don't forget to bring an umbrella because it rains very unexpectedly in Hue, and the Citadel is an enormous place with a lot of passages and houses and temples to visit. Some parts of the Citadel are still being restored and perhaps, in 1 or 2 years, it will be totally embellished!"
Don't miss it - it's fabulous.....even in the pouring rain. Pity we bombed the crap out of it in the 60's!
The Citadel is really wonderful They have rebuilt parts but have kept true to the original when finished it will be spectacular
The Citadel has been restored and is beautiful. Every time you turn around there is a new Kodak moment. Make sure you allow enough time to let the atmosphere of the complex sink in. It is a wonderful setting.
The Citadel suffered badly during the American war(North VN take over of Hue).The entrance hall and Theatre are in better condition.Refurbish is slowly taking place with UNESCO help since 2008 approx.
"We went there in the late afternoon and spent nearly all the time seeing and reading the history exhibition about Nguyen Dynasty - the royal family owned the country in 18th century and had this whole structure built by their people. The Citadel is just magnificent and super duper huge, it takes about 2 hours to explore the whole things. Everything left was so beautiful, both overall architecture and the details. We just kept opening our mouth anytime we saw a new section of the Citadel, from the Purple Forbidden City, the King's library, to the splendid musical room. We felt regretted when some parts of the sights as the Royal Kitchen, Medical Room were destroyed during the Vietnam War. But luckily, they're still trying to improve and preserve the heritage. Vietnamese should be proud of this sights; on the surface, Hue seems to be an ordinary city with ordinary scenery until you get to see this magnificent construction!"
spent an absorbing late afternoon here with a tour guide who enabled us to stay well after closing time. as peace descended it was hard to imagine the horrendous fighting that took place here during the Tet offensive. slowly but surely the palaces are being rebuilt and exquisitely so. take time to walk around and admire the mosaics. It was so quiet and peaceful with all the traffic the other side of walls and moats.
"Hue is renowned as the centre of culture and learning in Vietnam. The Citadel serves as a reminder of its prominent place in the history of the country. An immense construction over a huge area, it is worth spending some time wandering around and discovering it for yourself. A guide book would be sufficient for most people (Lonley Planet would suffice). Do take water as the heat may be an issue on an extended visit; the Citadel is more open plan than originally intended thanks to extensive American bombing during the war.

Renovation work is well underway and gives a glimpse of the beauty and magnificence of this palace.

A must visit in Hue."
Look out for the newly renovated reading room and go upstairs for a great view of the tiled rooves. Also there is a music/dance performance at about 15:00 in the theatre which is well worth the extra $5.
You can't go to Hue without seeing this. It a big place so can't make this a quick visit place and suggest you get a good tour guide to help you imagine how this must have been when the emperors resided there.
"We suspect that most people will come here on a tour and spend a maximum of two hours being pushed round the central buildings; however there is far more to see. We spent four hours wandering round the entire complex and kept seeming to find new buildings, gateways etc. There is no real need to a guide as everything is sign posted well, including in English.

Only down side, if there was one, was that apart from snack bars where you could get a drink or ice cream thee was really nowhere to sit a eat, have lunch."
"we spent few hours in this place and would recommend to everyone if come to Hue. very impressive scenary , close to center of city"
"Our cruise ship docked in Da Nang where we pre-booked a full day tour to Hue. It's about a 1¾ hour drive to this old imperial capital and cultural treasure chest of Vietnam. It's like an open air museum with hundreds of temples, pagodas, palaces and tombs. We first visited the remains of the Citadel, the magnificent court of the Emperors occupying about 1,000 acres with stone ramparts about 20 feet high and huge gates. Many buildings, destroyed in the war, are being reconstructed since it became a UNESCO World heritage Site. It has a way to go before it returns to it's former glory. You'll see the vast wing-roofed Palace and the ornate Imperial Library with detailed ceramic sculptures decorating the roof and the Forbidden Purple City, once the inner exclusive domain of the Royal Family. You need a bit of imagination to envision what it was like back then."
"Visited as part of a tour. Very hot, bring umbrella, stick to shade whenever possible. Fascinating part of Vietnam's older history. Huge area, be prepared to walk. Some interesting visual displays. It's in the city so not difficult to access. Relatively peaceful too, to be away from the motos!"
Large grounds and many buildings to see. Be aware that the palace was started in 1802 and may not be as ancient as some expect. Bombing in 1968 destroyed many buildings and these are slow being restored. The remaining buildings certainly help with imagining what life was like there in the days of the Emperors and the Forbidden Purple City. I'd suggest reading up a bit on FPC beforehand if possible although there are information panels available. Take a parasol if the sun is out - it gets rather hot in the grounds. Loads of photo opportunities. Allow a couple of hours at least.
"Massive complex, full of old & 'new' buildings, the laquer work is superb, and the whole place reeks of atmosphere. Lots to explore, and lovely grounds too."
"The citadel is impressive and interesting. There are several buildings in various states of repair. We loved wandering around marveling at the art and architecture. Kids could operate at their own pace and plenty to see. There are no restaurants inside, so we headed back to Hue for dinner and they let us in with our same tickets the next day and we spent a couple more hours."
Long ways tour was all day from Da Nang area check prices for tours like most in Vietnam wide range both in hotels and in travel service. This us one I paid little more to have better transportation due to the long distance. The Citadel was well worth seeing
"This attraction is a very interesting bit of Vietnamese history. The exterior is constructed much like a castle with a moat. The interior of the grounds has many buildings that have survived various wars and invasions. Makes you wonder how beautiful the ones that were destroyed were.
There is a a brief video showing constantly that gives a very interesting history of the area.
The construction and wood details are very beautiful. Would recommend this site, there is a fair bit of walking, but there is no rush, just enjoy it at your own pace."
"We visited the citadel at the end of a motorcycle tour I was very tired by this point so not fully engaged. What I can tell you is its beautiful and huge. It has 100 buildings some undergoing restoration as the latest typhoon took the roof off. All is very similar but still well worth a cost but be prepared to walk, a lot."
There is a lot of history in relation to the citadel which i very interesting. However it was extremely hot and struggled to stay focused.
"We went there by bicycle from our hotel at Nguyen Cong Tru hotel. Takes no time, parked at the citadel gate near the flag tower, with fees of 5kd/bike. Walked in and bought a 4 tourist attractions ticket for 360kd/pax (includes the 3 tombs and citadel, for 2 days - they wont tell u, lucky our hotel tell us abt this). Anyway, the citadel is pretty good, just need a very good walking shoes. One of the main attractions in Hue."
"When we went we got quite confused about what there was to see inside. Our guide books didn't offer any clarification and the ticket sales lady was utterly uninterested to inform us about where we should start and what we shouldn't miss. We asked for a map and got told that there was a map on the back of our ticket. (The smallest map in the world)

I'm going to try to sort out what you cannot miss when you visit the citadel. When you come inside, straight ahead you have the palace. It's very beautiful both inside and outside. Then the best part was the corner to the left of the entrance, behind and to the left of the palace. There you have the beautiful pagoda and some other beautiful houses and gardens. So if you are short on time start with the corner to the left of the palace. In fact if I was short on time I would skip the palace and go to explore that corner to begin with.

The citadel courtyard is very big and at daytime it gets insanely hot. Please remember sunscreen! I forgot and had to pay for it with a very red face the next day. The courtyard has two nice garden houses and in the corner to the right in front of the palace they have a nice small garden that offered needed shade and it was nice to walk through.

The heat made us slow but there are tons of information about alot of things around the citadel and if you want to read it all you probably need at least 4 hours in there. We only had 3 and just had enough time to walk around and see it all without reading all the information.

And yeah, they have a performance with music and dance everyday at 10.00-10.45 and 15.00-15.45 for 100.000 extra. We just missed it and that's my only regret from Hue. I spoke to someone who had seen it and they told me that they truly enjoyed the performance.

Maybe the citadel is one of those places where you should consider to hire a guide. We didn't, we still had a wonderful time enjoying the architecture and history, but maybe we would have gotten more out of it with a good guide."
"I really wasn't expecting as much as that, but once you got started it just kept going. Very well kept, thoroughly enjoyable and well worth the detour to Hue for two nights before going to Hoi An to visit."
"Although there was some damage made to the Imperial City during the last war work is under way to repair the site. The City is huge with beautiful buildings , archways and history. I would recommend booking a guide although there are translations here and there. Well worth the visit . If there is time there is a good market close by."
"Built in 1804 by the emperor who unified Vietnam, the Citadel encompasses three complexes - the outer citadel, the imperial city and the forbidden city. The walls of the outer citadel are in remarkable shape and the ornate entrance is being restored by UNESCO. Much of the site inside is ruins due to US bombing during the war but some structures remain like the Supreme Harmony Palace, the theatre and others. There is still a lot of history here despite the missing buildings."
"Worth the visit. Unfortunately, a lot has been destroyed. However, the gardens and some of the existing structures were interesting."
Interesting site but no comparison to China' forbidden city. Most personal contents were lost during the War and revolution. Interesting pagoda and history.
"Visited the Citadel for about 1½ hours and we enjoyed this visit very much. A lot has been destroyed, watch the video to see how they are going to rebuild this Imperial City. It is nice to see a mixture of old and new but to both applies: look at all the beautiful details..."
"I would call this the main reason to visit Hue. An amazing sire that is worth getting a guide for so you don't miss the significance of the buildings and walls. It is currently being lovingly restored to its former glory after extensive bombardment during the ""American War"""
"It was a 40 degree day when we visited so extremely hot in the walled citadel. Interesting buildings. Some of the gardens take a bit of seeking out but they are well worth it as a packed full of beautiful bonsai trees, ponds and tropical plants. Lovely little cafe in one garden for a bit of shelter from the sun. Be prepared to walk many kilometres as its a huge site."
"The Imperial Citadel was the only landmark of Hue that we managed to visit in the limited time we had. We got in at about 5pm, some time before dusk, and we stayed on until about 630pm where it was getting way too dark. Visiting at dusk however meant that we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves.

Plan to spend about 2 hours here and go earlier if you really want to take your time to visit every single part of the Citadel (some parts were closed by the time we got to them).

Bring good walking shoes, an umbrella in case it rains, and watch out for the sun!"
"This place is a must visit while you are in Hue. One should go to this place with substantial time, preferably around 3 hours, in order to have a good look at this place. Having a guide here makes sense. One should not miss out on the galleries located on the left side of the citadel as you enter."
"This is a must to visit when in Hue- our guide took us to the site where we were steeped in the history of a very rich past. The architecture, the gardens and the restoration are all very impressive. My husband had been to the Forbidden City and it did strike him as well that there was a distinct resemblance between if and this site. There is a lot to see and reflect upon and well worth time spent exploring its vastness."
Everyone who visits Hué must visit the Citadel which is without doubt the main reason to include the city in any itinerary of Vietnam. Sprawling overall large area the Citadel was subject to heavy fighting during the American war. Despite the damage sustained it is well worth visiting to see the remains of a time long past. Keep at least half a day to explore all the site has to offer
"I went to the Citadel not knowing what to expect but was pleasantly surprised.
There is an entry fee of around six dollars US which is not overly expensive and this entry charge goes towards the rebuilding of this amazing area.
We did not have a tour guide but listened in to larger groups as we made our way around this huge area.
I found it amazing that the rulers of this country had so much and their lifestyles would have been so grand.
The Citadel is definitely worth a look when visiting Hue"
"The Royal colours, the architecture and the history is wonderful. The place is well restored and the gardens are well cared for. The replica gives you a concise knowledge of the layout. The video is nice touch for travellers to understand the past of the citadel."
"Took a half-day tour arranged through the hotel. We had a driver, vehicle and personal guide; John. The trip from the resort at Lang Co to Hue took almost 2-hours. The main highway is undergoing expansion works so expect slow moving traffic and lots of lorries.

We arrived at Hue a little after 10am and the city is not as busy as others in Vietnam with all the scooters running around. Got dropped off infront of the Imperial Citadel and walked in. The layout is like a mini-Beijing (forbidden city). Wear shoes that can easily be removed as some of the rooms don't allow footwear. Restoration work is still ongoing, putting things back together after the Americans bombed the Citadel in 1967. If you don't have the stomach for China and the massive crowds, Hue gives you a similar experience. A half-day tour will take you to the important spots in the Citadel. You can of course wander around by yourself, but there's not much else other than the main buildings as everything else is rubble."
"Vietnam has several old citadels: Thang Long in Hanoi, Hoa Lu in Ninh Binh, Co Loa near Hanoi. Most of them were damage by the war and time. Hue imperial citadel is the only one left that kept almost the same. It still have some important palaces and gates such as Thai Hoa Palace, Dien Tho Palace, Truong Sang Palace, Hien Nhon Gate.
Entrance fee is 120k (6usd). At 10am and 3pm there are Royal Music performed in Duyet Thi Duong"
"When visiting Hue, the Citadel is a must see. Try getting there in the early morning to a void the hot sun and crowds. An hour and a half to two hour walk around the Citadel will start your day off right and teach you a good deal of historical information about Vietnam."
"Need a couple of hours for this one, big area to cover and information to read. It's a shame it was bombed in the war as it would have been a great place to see in its day....lots of little models to give you an idea. Have to see the citadel if you come to Hue, although this town is not as interesting as hanoi one even hoi an"
"The Imperial City is protected by fortified ramparts 2 km by 2 km, and ringed by a moat, full of water from the Perfume River, with a perimeter wall some 2.5 kilometers inlength. There were gardens and pavillions among with the damaged historic structures.
The city was made a UNESCO site in 1993. The buildings that still remain are being restored and preserved. The latest and the largest restoration project is planned to conclude in 2015."
It is a clear must see in Hue. Unfortunately the sight is not that well-possessed and clearly lacks some wholeness in the overall experience.
"Handspan Tour company provided us with a guide, Nhan, who is a trained history teacher. His stories about the emperors, the wars, through to now were enlightening. The experience would not have been the same without him. A leisurely one and a half hours wandering around with Nhan pointing things out - very informative."
"Totally worth the relatively expensive entrance ticket (150.000 VND, around 6.5 €). Don't miss out on any corner, there are hidden beauties around the place!"
There is great restoration work going on here. Interesting to see a work in progress. There could be a little more information
This is an interesting site and represents more recent history than most of the religious sites in Vietnam. The wall representing the dynasty explains a great deal. Most of the other structures require a good tour book or guide to recognize the different purposes .
"A majestic royal palace that has endured wars and weather, but remains for visitors to walk around, imagining the life of a Vietnamese Emperor. The loving locals are slowly restoring it to its original beauty. Something not to be missed."
Take your camera for a good half day experience and plenty of photo opportunities! We really enjoyed walking through all the different parts of the citadel. Either choose a guide or wander around by yourself (make sure you read plenty of information before you get here)
"The Hue Citadel dates from 1804, and what remains of it is fascinating. Undortunately a combination of the French, American and North Vietnamese armies destroyed many of the buildings in the 10km walls. There are plenty of things to see within the walls, including an army museum and the house lived in by Ho Chi Minh for 10 years. The jewel of the citadel is the Imperial Precinct, which rates its own review. There are several cafes and restaurants inside the citadel walls. Golf buggies available for tours around the citadel, and there are dozens of cyclo-rickshaws eager to get your custom. Most of the stuff in the outer citadel is free to visit, where visiting is allowed."
"The Imperial City in Hue is slowly being reconstructed after the Americans (and French) bombed it decades ago.

It offers interesting insights into the rise and fall of the House of Nguyen, who ruled Vietnam for 13 generations until the French turned them into puppets and the last king abdicated in favour of Ho Chi Minh.

There was a good photography exhibit and no touts inside the Imperial City (quite a few outside).

At least a full day is required if you want to explore the entire site. We probably saw 2/3rds in a few hours, but there was a lot more still to view there.

If you have visited the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul, this site makes for an interesting comparison."
"The Citadel at Hue and its Imperial City dates only back to 1805 when the Emperor Gia Long established the city. The extensive walled plan encompasses enormous gates, moats, interior gardens, temples, a theater, audience halls and more. Today, the site is a mix of completely restored buildings, some original structures in poor repair, and some areas reduced to rubble.

The Citadel was the site of a fierce battle during the American War and the devastation was lamentable. For almost 50 years, restoration work has been ongoing, but there is so much still to be done. The Thai Hoa Palace is sublime with its more than eighty red lacquer columns and what appear to be the original lighting fixtures. The Imperial Theater has been recently redone and is splendid. Much has also been restored in the temple complex.

I suggest taking two or more hours here and strolling about the area. There is much to see. And you can buy a packet of food to feed the fish in the pool in front of the Throne Palace. Bring yourself some good luck. Enjoy!"
"This is a very large area to cover but whatever you see will delight you. Not only are the buildings and entrance ways interesting, there are beautiful tropical trees, plants and topiary bushes. There is a drain spout on the top of one building that is the head of a dragon!"
"Really enjoyed our day here. We were a little lazy and got a taxi from our hotel to here as we knew we would be walking around a lot. Really interesting, lots to see and you can get some great photographs of your visit. It was good to imagine how life must have been back then."
"I loved this citadel, all the history and the statues and the gardens. I could have just sat here all day and felt, it was where I should be.I think we went to every single corner and into every room here. It was beautiful,serene and made me feel totally peaceful."
"We have just visited the citadel and were very disappointed. When you read all the good reviews one expects much more. Especially for an entrance fee of 150000 VND!! There are just a few complete buildings, the rest is destroyed or under construction. Won't recommend it!!!"
"A visit to the Citadel makes for an interesting half day. The Americans destroyed a lot of it during their war against Vietnam, so while you walk around the extensive area, you are greeted with a mixture of original, restored, and bombed out ruins. The bombing was clearly a travesty and perhaps part of a strategy to lower morale of the Hue population. Even with sympathetic restoration, it will never be the same as the new buildings are impressionistic rather than a true representation of fine detail in the buildings which were destroyed. One criticism. Like most of Asia, there seems to be little or no concern about littering. One would have thought that this still fascinating site would be an exception. Alas, no. Some of the signage has also become difficult to read with the passage of time (weathering). Forget the pleas of cyclo drivers to take you there from the main tourist hotel area. Walk over the bridge, take in the river and nearby market. It's all good fun and this part of the city is relatively pedestrian friendly."
"The place was beautiful but most buildings were destroyed during war, otherwise it will be comparable to the one in Beijing"
"Massive place in a state of disrepair - some parts are really nice others are wrecked and some are being rebuilt. Of all the monuments we went to this was the least interesting, but still good"
"Plenty to see and gardens in which to wander so soak up the atmosphere and admire the architecture, read the posters and takerefrehments. Easily a good half day trip."
"As one entered the bastian of this large expance, the guns saluted one a welcome.
The wast open space with the flag flying over the mast takes one to an era of grandiose.
The entrance to the citadel with the bridge over the moat attracted me to switch on my camera. The corridors, pillars, lamps, shapes, the dragons, everything fascinated me.
The throne had many a visitors photographing themselves as royality. The vidio shown was apt to inform one about the citadel. The visit to the other points around riding a tourist battery operated open van was great. The Opera Theatre took one to that golden era."
This replica of Bejing's Forbidden City is on a smaller scale but still the walled and moated compound was much larger than expected. It is beautiful to walk around. There are 3 sections. One of the sections is still occupied by shops and houses.
"I visited the Imperial city in January 2015, and we only gave ourselves two hours to visit. Boy did we underestimate. It's fascinating and beautiful. There is so much to see and learn, I would definitely go back for at least four or five hours. It's a great way to spend your time in Hue!"
We visited the Royal Citadel as part of a full day tour of Imperial Hue and found lots to interest us including the complex's central pavilion and the Palace of Supreme Harmony. Having a guide helped.
"We visited the citadel independently, arriving about 8.45am. When you purchase an entry ticket, you can also purchase the service of a guide- 150000 dong ? A fascinating place to walk around, and if you have a group it is an idea to also purchase a driver and electric car to see the ore areas of the grounds aside from the main palace. There is a lot do restoration occurring and it will be a different place in 5 years. Well worth visiting.
On leaving we decided to purchase a cyclo to look at other areas within the citadel. We paid 150000 dong for an hour. This was good but take care to negotiate that you need to be back to your starting point at the hour's conclusion. The trick is when the time is up- they have you at the other side of the town and demand more money to get you back. The only really interesting stop was Ho's house 1895-1901 and a wall gate- part from that they were happy to take us to stops ie shops which we didn't need to stop at. An easy way to get a feel for this large area"
The site is a short walk or ride from the main part of town. There's a lot of space here so you can avoid crowds and discover quiet corners. Worth a few hours out of your day.
"Really interesting and attractive to site. It is useful to visit with a guide who can explain more, but a helpful video explains much - the layout and purpose of the buildings, what you can see, and what you can nolonger see because it was bombed away by the Americans."
"An interesting look at the history of Hue, and you can see some areas that were damaged in the American war. Very well looked after and respected."
Passing through the bridges across the moats gives a real sense of the power that lay within the Citadel. There were many Vietnamese from outlying villages visiting when we were there. All beautifully dressed and willing us to photograph and be photographed with them. Such lovely people.
"Sad to see what state wars have left the imperial city in, however a must of a visit to see another side of vietnamese history and the sheer size of the place. Allow a few hours minimum and take plenty of water as the grounds are quite large and it can be very hot during the day."
"We visited th citadel at th end of the one day Hue tour and only 3 of the group of 20 still came along. But it's definitley worth to see, even as most of the building have been destroyed, some get now restored. Sad to see that such a high cultural site has suffered in the war and could not have been protected."
"The Citadel was a great place to just wander around in peace. It was a bit crowded near the main gate but the crowd dispersed as you go further in, and many times I found myself alone with no one in sight."
"This place is big so be prepared to walk. We hired a driver to take us to four sights in one day. (Khai Dinh Tomb, Minh Mang Tomb, Thien Mu Pagoda and the Citidel) If you can afford the $45 US for a driver, it is well worth the money as these sights are quite far apart. All worth seeing. We only had one day, so saw them all the same day. You can purchase a ""package ticket"" for a reduced price at the first sight rather than buying individual tickets (Thien Mu Pagoda is free). At the Citidel, it would be preferable if you had a map as there are no "" you are here"" signs. We did not have one. Be careful about going mid day as it can be very hot. We visited after lunch and did not encounter any crowds but it was a cloudy day.

Tip: if you a directionally challenged like we are, have your driver right down in Vietnamese, the gate he will meet you at at the end of your visit. We got turned around on a cloudy day and when we asked directions, his note was extremely helpful. You don't want to do unnecessary walking if you don't have to."
"This historic site is ons place you must visit but you need water, good walking shoes & water. The only way to see this is on foot and a certain amount of fitness is required. By the end of the day we had walked over 10 kms. Suggest you start this tour very early by lunch time it is getting too hot & there's very little shade. Totally recommend."
"My husband, (almost) 4 year old daughter and I spent about 2.5 hours walking around the remain of the Citadel. I could have explored further and stayed the whole day but it wasn't that exciting for my daughter. Go early to avoid the hottest part of the day. We had a guide show us around (100,000VND) for an hour then checked out other parts and had a drinks break for the rest. Great photographic displays, including images of the Citadel at various stages throughout its history. Amazing restoration work – it would be great if the restorers could leave some elements of the ruins in place, to truly demonstrate the extent of the destruction. For now, there's plenty of ruins to see, and it makes for a very stark comparison. Try and time your visit to see performances of musicians using traditional instruments. There's a few performances on throughout the day (free). There's also performances in the restored theatre, although I'm not sure whether costs are associated with that one."
"Get an impression of how the Vietnamese Emperors lived in splendour before Vietnam was struck by war. Tourist on tour seen to go to just the central area, but the Citadel has so much more to offer. We went on our own and spent over 4 hours here and still did not see everything."
"The Imperial City should be on your sightseeing list of Vietnam major attractions. It's expansive and is a photographers paradise. The entrance fee is 105 Dong per person. Give yourself 2 to 4 hours to explore the city.
Without a guide or a good guidebook you will only have a limited understanding of the City's history. There is a guide service available near the entrance that is reasonably priced. Our suggestion is to hire a guide for an hour and then explore the city on your own the remaining part of your visit. Early morning or late afternoon is the best time to visit-less people and better pictures."
"This Imperial City is built on a smaller scale than the Chinese version. With this one, you can roam freely and explore until your heart is content. There is a fee to enter. Entry and exit points are not the same. If you are with a group, be sure to set a meeting place and time. We actually lost a member of our group for two hours and needed the help of the staff to locate. Overall, worth the trip."
"We spent the afternoon wandering around arre, and it was lovely. Very quiet and relaxing. The light was beautiful at around 4.30pm."
"105,000dong each entry fee. Beautiful remnants, plenty of information boards around the place. Would have been stunning in it's day. We toured it ourself and whilst there are information boards I think I would have preferred to have someone telling me the history verbally"
Wear comfortable shoes. The property of the Citadel is huge. Each ticket costs 150kVND. UNESCO site. Amazing property with lots of history.
"A great walk around this historical complex. War buffs will see the blown out building and mortar and bullet holes around the complex. A massive place so take your time. We took a guide and found it very informative.
A definite must for any visitor to Hue"
"Wear good shoes and walk this beautiful area. It has so many ins and outs and amazing sights. A photographers paradise with stark contrasts and lush greenery...eat mangoes from a street vendor, avoid the ""rickshaw"" drivers and dip into this historical place"
"We bought a combined ticket at 360,000 Dong, which allowed visits to the Citadel and 3 tombs (Minh Mang, Khai Dinh and Tu Duc). It takes at least 3 hours to visit the Citadel, if you want to see all the buildings and exhibits. A lot of the imperial city was heavily damaged during the war. A number of buildings are currently being reconstructed. If you visit early in the morning, there are fewer tourists and you can often have the large parts to yourself. I suggest taking a guide who can explain the history. There are very few markers and signage is generally poor. Also, while you have to enter through the Ngo Mon Gate, you can't exit there."
"Worth your visit. Wear proper walking shoes. Lots of walking. Bring an umbrella. Very hot. Bring a bottle of water to keep yourself hydrated and if possible a small towel to wipe off your sweat.

But it's worth your time."
"Within the 10 km long walls is the Thai Hoa Palace, the former royal family
On this richly decorated building and pagodas and ports is still restored fortunately, since destroyed large parts of the citadel during the so-called Tet Offensive in the Vietnam War
For weeks, Americans competed here in 1968 against the Vietcong, only to win, meters area Or the citadel can ever be fully restored is not clear
It remains a unique complex where the names of the buildings as the Palace of Supreme Harmony Gates and Earthly Peace Pagoda of the Heavenly Lady sound magical if you want to enter the city, you have three inputs
Formerly the middle entrance only for the emperor, the other inputs were intended for the civil and military mandarins
Once inside you have the Square of the Great Ceremonies and the Palace of Supreme Harmony, only then starts the actual prohibition"
"i have a nice holiday :))
I am so happy. I hope I have a chance to come back here
It has a fresh air and people are friendly"
"A marvellous experience. Prepare to do a bit of walking, but the grandeur of the place is well worth it."
"This is another world. And you can see some of the destruction that was left by American bombers - not a happy reminder. Beautiful, fascinating and well worth at least a half-day if it is not blistering hot."
"I went with limited expectations given what I'd read on TA about the citadel - but I was so pleasantly surprised by what I saw. Ok, it's not the seat of one of history's major empires (ie Beijing) but it is a really evocative and calming place to wander around and take in. I did the rickshaw ride around the old town first (which is very missable) and then entered the citadel at about 4pm - when the light is absolutely perfect for photos. The whole place glowed. Walking around it though the most striking thing was the serenity of it. A really memorable outing and worth making the effort for."
If one is visiting Vietnam and especially Hue one should visit this pearl. It is just amazing. But (!) get yourself a guide because otherwise it is hard to get his place and the history around it.
"Compared to other sights in Vietnam, this one had quite good translations and signs which ways to go."
"It's still a must-see. There is not much right now, too many is ruined. It would have been better when all the renovation work is done."
I spent a day wandering around the Citadel. There are some beautifully restored buildings scattered around the area surrounded by ruins of former structures. It was fascinating to see this area and read about the history of the place. It is also a great place to go if you're in to photography.
"We did this on our own at our own pace, so much to take in and see and wonder in hindsight if we should have asked our guide to come with us.

In its heyday this must have been an amazing place, its shear size is awesome, remember your water though in the heat of the day its sizzling>"
"No one visiting Hue should miss the Imperial City. Even though it was badly damaged during the wars, it is still interesting to walk around the complex. Would highly recommend to watch the video that is showed in the Palace of Supreme harmony, after the throne hall), as it explained the history, and what the city has looked like before the wars.
Also, don't rush through it, take your time to explore the various bits (in one area you can learn about the monarchs who have lived in Hue)."
"We were here in March 2015 on a very hot day; whilst much of the site has clearly been lost there is still enough for the visitor to see and gain a good understanding of the importance of this site to Vietname history. Make sure though you have a guide - no doubt in the future they will issue audio guides, but until then enjoy a guide. Lots to see, a large area and well worth the visit."
"Take your time to absorb this ""must see"" Imperial City.
Fascinating place and do take a camera along. Our tour guide did an amazing job in explaining the different areas and buildings in this city.
When you plan your trip, do include visits to the various tombs of past kings and on your way back, inquire about catching a small boat back to a market near the city centre, we did and it was worthwhile as you see a different perspective of Hue.
Enjoy your trip!"
"altho damaged during wars, this sight is not to be missed. have a guide to explain the context, otherwise you will miss out on a lot! bring a hat, as it can be hot and not much shade. also, sunscreen!"
"Very imposing building, very interesting history. If you are visiting the are this is a 'must see'. There are lots of different types of interesting buildings and you would need a few hours to see everything"
I was kind of impress by the area of this place. This place has mini bus with around 12 seats to carry visitors around. Good price and nice place to visit
you can get lost for hours wondering the 160 buildings but make sure you wear suncream and take a hat as some of the walk is over large fields.
A major tourist attraction in Hue. It is being renovated following the Americans bombing it during the war. I feel having a guide made a big difference and helped understand the history of the place and the intrigues of this former royal court.
"This is a huge site with some parts restored, others with a look of gentle decline. The entire area has taken quite a battering during the war but offers a fascinating peak into the forbidden city and the lives of the emperors."
Much of the citadel is being reconstructed as part of a long term plan to rebuild the whole citadel. The portions that are done were amazing.
"Hue Imperial City (The Citadel) needs about 2-4 hours trip. It's located at the center of Hue and it's on a large area.

The place by it's self is nice and interesting but that's it.
If you are interesting with Vietnam/ Hue History it's worth while to visit."
Don't really understand all of the less than five star ratings. How many palaces spread over acres and acres are there in the world? It did take quite a beating during the war but it is being restored. Most of them buildings surrounding the 12 or so hude interior courtyards have something to see. The emperors garden was probably ly the most beautiful. There are a couple of nice atmospheric colonial style administrative buildings on the periphery. Similar in design to Tianenmen in Beijing but not restored as well Yet.
"This historic landmark is a beautiful reminder of events both recent and ancient. This site was a citadel for ancient kings as well as the site of a Vietnam-American War battle. This is definitely worth a few hours visit. Also, get a guide that speaks excellent english if you can - it makes the experience much better with a guide who can crack jokes!"
"I found Hue itself as a quite boring place, The Citadel was a great way to kill time waiting for the bus to Phong Nha caves. Spend like 2 or 3 hours there."
Reealy beautiful and well worth a visit. In the (very slow) process of being restored. Less crowded than the forbidden city in Bejing. Nice gardens too.
The Imperial City is not to be missed when travelling to Hue. Explore the vastness of this ancient city and let your imagination take you to what it would have been like to live there so long ago. You cannot appreciate the beauty and history that awaits you until you do this trip. Highly recommended. Our guide booked from Danang was excellent and gave great insight into the history of the city. nguyengoc88hoian@gmail.com. He was an excellent English speaking guide
"Walking around the area you can see where the buildings would have stood and how the palace would have looked.
I would highly recommend a guide as there are very few signs and the information that was given by my guide was extremely helpful in imagining the palace as it once was."
"A bunch of buildings in disrepair , not worth trekking around during 30 degree weather for imo. The mosaic work at the gates are quite nice, but that can be seen without having to enter the grounds.
Pay the 105k vnd, head straight across the bridge into the emperor building or whatever it is, check out the miniature display of the citadel grounds, realize it's all pretty much the same thing over and over again, come out the other side, hang a right and find the exit. That was the extent of my journey in the citadel.
Has some nice trees/areas with shade but I guess it just wasnt for me."
"The Most important sight in Hue town. The Citadel is huge and takes almost half a day of walking around to see all the sights within it. The entrance fee includes the visit to the Citadel, the Forbidden City and also the adjoining Arms Museum.

There are no clear signages as to the order in which one has to proceed to see all the sights inside the citadel complex. So its advisable to book a tour guide at the entrance. And if u r travelling solo just shadow behind one of the numerous travel groups that throng the place. that way ur sure not to miss any of the sights inside the Complex."
"Very interesting hot and lots of walking but worth it. Lots of places to sit and cool down .Wonderful sights, will remember this for a long time."
"The Imperial City at Hue is the best-preserved remnant of a vast citadel and royal quarters that once existed on the site. In the early nineteenth century the first King Gia Long wished to build a replica of the Forbidden City of Beijing.

The ruins of the Imperial City are both old and more recent. In 1968 the Viet Cong launched an attack on the city of Hue. It was the Tet Offensive and the largest and bloodiest military action of the war up until that point. The fighting went on for a month and the Viet Cong massacred many people. This resulted in the destruction of the city by U.S. forces. The Viet Cong hid in the Imperial City fighting the US until they died from lack of supplies.
Even so, the remaining buildings are enough to give the visitor a sense of how the Vietnamese interpreted Chinese imperial architecture and adapted it to their culture. for more info and photos go to http://travelwellflysafe.com/2015/03/17/where-are-the-kings-of-hue-viet-nam/"
"Take about 3 hours to walk around this ancient city. Wonderfully restored and preserved, it's a feast for your eyes and curious spirit."
"Main attraction in Hue the Citadel and the purple forbidden city. It is close to the city centre where all the tourist stays. You can hire a bike and ride there in 10 min across the river. Don't be afraid the traffic is crazy but you will use to it quickly. You have to pay parking fee for your bike.
The entrance fee is reasonable and the ancient city is beautiful with a great garden. Definitely worth to wisit!"
"If you are in Hue this is the 'must see' sight to visit. I would recommend a very good guidebook and some background reading, or better still a guide. Official guides are relatively cheap in S. E. Asia and spend five years at university so are very well trained.

The complex of the Citadel is large and it takes time to cover the main sites. As a UNESCO heritage site significant funding is being put in to renovation, but unfortunately the two war, with France and America, completely destroyed some of the building and there are no remaining documents to guide their reconstruction.

The site is relatively modern, being started in1804. It is worth taking the time to read the many displays which detail life within the royal court. The hierarchy of the wives, mandarins, concubines and eunuchs is fascinating."
"Quite an impressive site. Extensive size so plan several hours to see the full scope.
Watch video as starting point if you can: provides background and perspective. Digital imaging useful in showing work done, visualizing what building would have been at its height and what could be if fully renovated.
Understanding overall layout of city and how buildings related to totality and their use made visit more meaningful."
"Hue is the main city where the Tet Offensive was launched by the Vietnam Cong; the tragic deaths of thousands of innocent Vietnamese and Americans was the result. Many were shot in the streets with their children and many more were buried alive. I never had a very clear understanding of why we had to be involved in the Vietnam conflict and the Tet Offensive gave it clarity. The citadel was badly damaged and a full restoration will continue years into the future. If you appreciate history, study Tet before you arrive in Hue. On the Internet there is a great deal of actual film footage available to see. The streets of Hue light up at night with life and many shops. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit."
"Make sure you see the film at the beginning, well worth it. A big site and very hot at the moment , bound to get worse as rainy season approaches"
"One could spend multiple days touring everything inside the Imperial City but we were only there for a few hours so didn't see everything. The place is very large - make sure to look at from an aerial view on-line or google earth to really appreciate how large it is. Plan to do lots of walking. I would recommend having a guide take you to help provide the history and stories. There are a few things to read on your own but otherwise it would not have been as educational or interesting if it weren't for our guide explaining what we were seeing. How long you spend there will really depend on how interested you are in the history and ruins. However, if you took the time and effort to stop in Hue, I can't imagine not visiting for some amount of time as this truly is the biggest (literally and figuratively) site to see in Hue."
"While not particularly old, this more modest version of the Forbidden City is very evocative of the glory that was Hue"
Work is in progress to restore the city to its original grandeur. Beautiful buildings. Intricate workmanship. A must visit.
"This place is massive! We visited on an extremely hot and humid day but I found the citadel one of the most historically interesting places on my travels through Vietnam. The architecture alone is definitely not worth missing, and although it is in need of repairs, it still holds an element of royal grandeur. The only thing I worried about (and made me very uncomfortable) was a poor little pony, which looked like it was about to drop dead, was being forced to pull tourists around in a huge carriage."
"Needs some work still, more donations required, you can see the importance of the area to the history and culture in Hue"
"We revisited the Citadel - the Imerial City the previous capital of Vietnam when it was ruled by the Nguyen Dynasty. First visited in 2011. This is a great attraction and there is a good deal to see. And experience and very enlightening. The previous visit we did by cyclo a two hour tour so this time we decided to walk. We entered by the main gate to the Citadel and walked the entire inside walled area from here. We went to go inside the walled Imperial City and the Forbidden City but was taken aback by the charges. Locals 75,000 VND non locals - tourists that do not look local 105,000 VND. On principle we decided not to revisit the Imperial City and simply continue to walk the surrounding areas. Local shops, cafes and restaurants are everywhere. The prices are good and the people very friendly and happy to see you walking around the back streets.
Recommend a visit but up to you is you want to pay the visitors inflated entrance fee."
"Visited here solo and spent easily 3 hours touring around the citadel.
Its unfortunately not as magnificent as it was in the past due to the wars in the 40's and Tet offensive/American bombing but it is simply a must see in Hue.
The Forbidden City within was fascinating to see the detail and restoration work.
I could have easily spent a full day here. If in a group a guide would be a good idea I was wondering around on my own. A nice place to reflect on the damage war can cause"
"Having experienced the Forbidden City in Beijing,the Citadel is based on it,needs a lot of renovation work which we were advised is being funded by UNESCO.
Sadly parts of the Citadel were bombed during the war,however it is well worth visiting and learning about the History with the French connection,Chinese influence and Vietnamese culture."
"Fascinating fortress established in 1805. The design of the citadel was heavily influenced by the rules of Chinese geomancy.The result is an usual yet elegant complex. Much to enjoy: palaces, temples, massive ramparts,bastions and moats. Unfortunately, The Citadel sustained heavy damage during the American War. Hire a rickshaw if the walk is too much for you."
The most important thing to see in Hue as apart from the tombs & the odd pagoda there isn't much else worth turning up for. But the Citadel shouldn't be missed. Lots of restoration still going on following the damage done in what the Vietnamese call the American wat.
"Nice enough, but did not meet my expectations as a lot of it is reconstructed and looks it, there is quite a bit of building work and cheap souvenier stores/ to pay for experience (like dressing up and sitting on a throne) which ruin the atmosphere. Found it also a bit dirty,it was really not the special experience I was expecting.
Go if you are in Hue, but not worth travelling from Da Nang/ Hoi An in my view."
"This is a smaller version of China's forbidden city. Very interesting and beautiful place but a pity wasn't much been done to preserve this place. If in Hue, this is a place not to be missed."
Plan on having some time to really see all that it has to offer. It is interesting to see the old mixed with remnants of war.
Maybe being too harsh but the site is tired and dirty. Needs somebody who appreciates the need to update the site and return its once obvious historical appeal. Still worth seeing but not spectacular
Not very exciting if you've bee to the forbidden city in Beijing. Everything is in ruins and the restoration process is very slow. Maybe it will be worth seeing in several years.
"Great atmosphere, very peaceful. Walk-in along the street is a must. It's also interesting to wear the queen/king's clothes and know more of the empire life of Vietnamese in the past."
This citadel comples would not have had any meaning without a tour guide. We got one at the front gate of the citadel and it was a worthwhile investment. It has an extensive history dating back to the early 1800's however some of the buildings inside the complex have been destroyed by bombs. The tour gave us the facts of the main buildings and grounds and then we explored the nooks and corners ourselves.
"Hire a rickshaw to take you on a 2 hour tour of the citadel and you'll have a great time.
But....make sure you pick an operator wearing an official badge as many non-licenced pedallers show up to steal the business and a semi-fight broke out over who should steer us about!"
"Although much is still derelict and can't be explored, the overall scale is impressive and the undamaged/restored areas are super. Don't just visit the central areas (most do) but have a good long stroll around the grounds to really appreciate the scale. You need a knowledgeable guide or a detailed guidebook (not sure if they exist in English)."
we were on a half day tour with Hue Private cars- our driver stopped inside the gate and said come back in one hour! No map or idea of where we should go in this enormous place it was a bit daunting. Decided on a cyclo ride instead and negotiated a price with two men. We seemed to spend most of the time being driven around the 'living' area altho we saw several temples and the bonsai gardens we had trouble getting them to go back to where we had started(easy to get lost!!!) and after 1 1/2 hours they dropped us well away and demanded more money. Shame as it left a bad taste. Better to organise with someone beforehand so you get whet you want and see what you want!!
"Really in formative but needs some renovation work
Staff not overly interested just got on with doing their job"
"This is a must see. We were very impressed, there is lots to see, and you vold spend one whole day or more to.explore everything. It is an essential plac to understand more of the history of this stunning country. The only regret I have is that we did a full on day seeing dozens of things around Hue and we couldnt dedicate the full attention this place deserves. Will be back next time. I wonder what reviewers that don't give 4 or 5 stars expect. Still a lot to go through with the restorations, yes, but... remember that a terrible war happened here..."
"A very peaceful historical attraction to visit in Hue. The architecture is interesting as is the artefacts on display.
We found the large information boards helpful ( written in Vietnamese, English and French ) explaining the day to day life of the emperors and their families. The video, with English sub titles was also helpful.
We spent about 3 hours there, sufficient time to view.
It would have been helpful if we were given / opportunity to purchase, a simple guide leaflet, in English, just to use as we wandered through the buildings. We were dismayed by the cost of bottle of water. Remember to bring your own! Toilets were clean and western style!"
Being keen photographers we really enjoyed the citadel. the architecture inside and out is amazing. Put some time aside to really enjoy it.
"The citadel is big, but nothing in it is terribly impressive on a standalone basis. There are a good number of signs and a 10 minute video at the entrance, but I think a guide would have been helpful. Keep in mind much of this was restored in the late 1800's and early 1900's and nothing is more than 200 years old, so this is not some Angkor-type ancient ruin. There are some nice temples though, some interesting, large cauldrons, etc. The museum inside the Forbidden City has some context too, telling the story of the Nguyen dynasty emperors.

If you've been to a lot of Asian ruins and temples, then there's no need to see this or make it a destination. If you're passing through Hue, it's worth a stop. If you have the energy, try to see the tombs in the same day rather than spending all day here."
"Although quite a lot of buildings destroyed by the war, there is steady restoration work which is looking good. In its day this must have been awesome. Entrance fee of 105000d, remember to dress respectfully and take plenty of drinking water. Takes a good half day to see all. A trishaw ride back to the city is an adventure."
"Much of the forbidden city was destroyed by war, so the architecture isn't the main reason to go here. But there are interesting photos, posters, etc with information on it that will help you understand the Nguyen Dynasty period if you have the time. Allow at least 3-4 hours."
"We hired a driver to take us from Hoi An to Hue for the day of sightseeing. It was a long trip, but well worth it. This is a beautiful city that should not be missed. It is a day long trip.
There is not anywhere to eat in the city so plan accordingly. There is a place there where you can dress up like the emperor and wife and get your picture taken on the throne. Very fun. We used our camera and got many pictures"
In comparison with the hassle and bussle of SE Asia this was an oasis of tranquility. Easily walked to from Eldora Hotel and an enjoyable morning wandering around.
"This was little like the Forbidden City in Beijing, smaller and less restored. It was seriously damaged by bombs in the Vietnamese Wars. The part restored is very good. What was particularly fun was dressing up as an emperor and sitting on his throne and carry cart."
"We had a great day touring the Citadel, The complex is massive so take your time and immerse yourself in the history and events that have happened here over time."
"Easy to navigate, no one bothering you trying to sell stuff. Very informative video presentation. Some restoration has been done and some underway - nice easy morning out"
"this is a place not to be rushed, each area is well defined and sigh posted, we found most of the ""tours"" that were bookable only allowed an hour to see this amazing building, we went on our own, and spent 4 hrs walking round, so much to see and enjoy"
Good to see the dynasty. Travellers can decide to buy entrance ticket which includes a tourguide. The tourguide will walk around with group & tell lots of stories about the king & his life. Stories are interesting. Travellers can walk around to take pictures as they want to.
"While its not truly ancient, there have been some vicious battles fought in it with modern weapons. Some either escaped damafe or are being repaired. Given this is a 19th century complex, it is amazing to think it was built in such a way, that ancient Chinese Emperor's would have approved of.
Some areas have been left as they were, for now, and you can see the battle damage.
This a very busy area, so go early and get a guide, without whom you'll not really understand the complexities!"
This was a huge complex and on a very hot afternoon quite exhausting but there were little refreshment carts hidden away that were very welcome to encounter.
"The Citadel its self has a lot of interesting facts :), I suggest you to spend a whole day or a half day tour day to slowly learn about interesting there."
"Definitely a must visit place...restorations are still ongoing, but considering how intensive this place was bombed during the war, very impressive...do not miss it! There is an exit all the way in the back, saves a long walk back to the front (unless your bus or group is waiting at the front of course)...entrance fee is 105.000 dong"
"Go early, before it is too hot.
The scale of this Cham site is huge. Parts have been destroyed in the various wars but the 3 sets of walls, leading to the Forbidden City let you feel what it must have been like when it was a working palace.
Drink lots of water."
"If you have not seen the Forbidden city then you will be very impressed here, very similar only smaller"
Well woth a couple of hours if you are interested in history. It's a work in progress as they are constantly renovating. Can be a little difficult to find the entrance to the actual palace as its within the citadel walls. Suggest entering the citadel via the main entrance (head for the flag) and the entrance to the palace can be seen from there. The cyclo drivers tried to tell us it was closed for dinner like the museum - it wasn't and opens all day. There are places to buy drinks and ice creams inside. The signs aren't very clear so recommend taking a map.
"The big citadel with the surrounding walls is very impressive. Many of the building were destroyed during the American war, on other building you can still find the bullet holes. Great work of restorartion has started and there is a very long way to continue. You can easily see the splendour and the remains of very decicate and rich decorations and th ebuilding style."
Wow! We weren't expecting quite such an impressive scene. It was very quiet when we went thankfully. A rival to Beijings Forbidden City but on a smaller scale. Arrived by rickshaw with our guide. Great fun. A must in Hue.
"Very interesting visit, took a guide, not only did we learn a lot about the imperial city, he was able to answer many questions about Vietnam in general. Such a shame so much of the city was lost to French bombing but hopefully they continue with their restoration work."
"This is a very large compound and many of the original buildings were destroyed. You can still see bullet holes in some of the walls.

Some parts have been beautifully restored, some gates are old and lovely. Some almost looked like paintings.

Worth a visit-recommend researching the history before hand"
Though much of the buildings have been rebuilt since the 'American War' destroyed a lot of the Citadel the original buildings are extra ordinary and the restoration on the others has been sympathetically carried out. It wasn't too busy when we went so was a comfortable and informative trip.
It is OK but not as great as in Bagan in Myanmar or the statues in Anchor. No comparison. I was a bit disappointed
it's a large place and it would help if you had a guide book in hand. large parts of it are being restored but its a must-see in Hue
The first time I come to the Hue Imperial City.Everything is good but not cheap.I take a lot of photos.It is very interesting
"The Citadel, and the tombs of its Emperors, are about the oldest and best preserved history you will find in Vietnam.

Only finished in 1833 and unoccupied since the last Emperor resigned in 1945 it is still largely demolished due to the USA's sterling efforts to flatten it in 1968.

The introductory video is pretty basic and the information around the individual areas not very good but there is still enough to see and read to give an idea of what imperial life must have been like.

The one decent set of information boards with accompanying pictures in the first hall you get to after the entrance is worth spending some time over in order to set it in context. There is also a reconstruction of what it looked like in its prime in the adjacent balcony area.

The site is quite large and easy to lose your way in so take a map of it to find your way around.

Allow 4 hours including stops."
"We spent half of a day to walk around this huge palace but still didnt cover all due to hot weather. Its worthy a visit, they offer some king/queen clothes rental for your photographs that seems a great way to keep memories."
The heritage and scope of this place is amazing. Top points: Get a guide if u can as there is lots to see and understand Get the combination ticket which includes the two best tombs.
"A must do in Hue, the palace was badly destroyed during the Vietnam war and UNESCO is helping to rebuild it, but to me keeping as it is would be amazing as you can get the feeling of how the history developed involving the different eras, you can still tell how each stones were being placed unlike the totally being rebuild forbitten city of Beijing."
"I had high hopes for the citadel, being that I'm both a history and architecture lover, but I won't lie… I left disappointed. The walls surrounding the complex are impressive and you go in with that certain amount of trepidation and wonder, but once inside you discover a historical site that hasn't quite been looked after and newly restored buildings that lack that old world charm.

The grounds are immense and it's worth noting that if you're not a fan of walking, its probably best to seek out the electric tour buses that can be found at the Hien Nhon Gate. We enjoy a good walk, so we decided to guide ourselves around by foot, which took around half a day.

Getting a guide is probably worth your while so you can understand the history behind the palace, but if thats not your thing, there are many guide books that you can use to do your own self guided tour. A vast majority of the buildings were destroyed in the war, and some also to natural causes such as termites etc. so much of the complex is in ruins.

The biggest disappointment to me was that the gardens didn't seem to be up kept very well, water features were stagnant and dirty and there seemed to be a lot of rubbish and modern day rubble just lying around, probably from the construction workers reconstructing some of the buildings. I expected more atmosphere which it just seemed to lack. It's nice to know they are doing what they can to rebuild some of the fallen buildings, but the new structures don't really have any history and you cannot recreate what once was if you're not going to combine that with the right atmosphere.

I feel the complex could really be a great place to visit if they brought more staff into the grounds to clean it up and tend to the gardens. Perhaps have people dressed in the clothes that were worn in that time, give people a real sense of what it was like in the 1800's when the emperor was in rule. The opera house could have traditional shows operating, even some restaurants within the grounds that serve local food and shops selling local artworks or handicrafts. It needs to come alive again and the spirit of the place needs to come back in order for tourists and visitors to feel how really special it is. It is worth a look at, but I hope there will be more improvements in the future to continue it's longevity as a major tourist attraction of Hue."
"Allow several hours to walk through the Citadel. It is true that most of the buildings have been destroyed, but the reconstruction is good. Bring an umbrella to hide from the sun as there is little shade and much ground to cover. Watch out for the ricks haw drivers as they Can NOT take you to the Citadel."
"I live in Beijing and there is no square of land in any major capital that has the history (ancient, magnificent and yet also horrible-I won't get into that since I live there but you know what I mean) than the Forbidden City but The Imperial City is still very impressive on its own. Read the other reviews to get a more detailed description because I didn't take a tour. Neither did I ride a motorbike. It was Tet Holiday and I wanted to rent a motorbike but be prepared here. THEY DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH! They do in HCMC, HANOI, HOI AN, not so much in DA NANG but they do not in HUE! The city is one big tourist scam. They are aggressive in parting you with your money. Stay firm, do not pay the prices they are asking as they are grossly inflated. We didn't take a tour and I would suggests that you do. We like to do everything ourselves but from Da Nang to Hue the train and the views the 2 and a half hour ride is worth it. Now the train isn't splendid haha but the views are wonderful. Now outside of the Citadel there will be cyclobikes. Bargain hard or don't take one. They will ask 200,000 Dong, to take you from the train to the Citadel. The price should be 30-50,000 Dong. We paid 75,000 Dong for an hour ride from the train station to the Citadel and ride around the entire city. That was cool! However, near the end of the hour on minute 50, the driver wanted to finish so he could pick up another couple. I told him he had 10 more minutes. He said NO Finished. I said ok, but no money. He said no. I proceeded to walk out the bike and then he rode around for another 5 minutes. I didn't want to ruin my wonderful ride around the citadel so I just left and paid. There is not much food in the complex and even though it wasn't terribly hot be prepared to sit in the shade and drink some iced coffee and pack a lunch. I'd see it again if I ever return to Hue but I would most definitely get a private guide!"
"If you're in the area you must see this. Some of the buildings were destroyed during the war and used as target practice but what remains is still worth seeing, whats left of some buildings are around 300 years old (that our guide told us). We had an english speaking tour guide which is a great idea so you can learn about what happened and what the buildings are otherwise you can walk around by yourself. Well worth going to see if you have the time."
"The citadel has an interesting history and the grounds are kept in lovely shape. There are lots of flowers. The fortifications were wonderful when they were built, but fell to modern warfare. They are in good condition and show the wounds from the wars fought here."
"Restoration from the war is slow, but definitely worth a visit. Walk all the way to the back for a full scope of what it must have been like."
"The Imperial City was home to Nguyen dynasty emperors from 1802-1945. This UNESCO site is vast but fascinating. They do an excellent job of describing through pictures and other visuals the lives of the 13 emperors. This is so interesting. I walked all around and spent about 3 hours. I could have spent the day. It is authentic, and unruined. You can visualize the emperors and their courts in the surroundings."
Most of the buildings in the citadel were destroyed during recent wars but there is still plenty to see and restoration work continues. Exibits are well documented so its easy to do on your own. Check times of performances in the theatre. Relax and have coffee in the Pleasure Pavilion in the Emperor's Mothers complex. See the panoramic view from the top floor of the Emperor's reading pavilion.
Well you can't visit Hue without going to the Citadel. It certainly added to my knowledge of Vietnamese history. The recently renovated sections are very beautiful. What we enjoyed most was the wonderful performance of court music at the theatre. Well worth the $5.
"It is a very interesting place, unfortunately the war destroyed some parts of it luckily UNESCO has helped to restore it. Two hours will be enough to walk around. My favorite place was the theater, very colorful and in good shape. Don't miss to watch the 10 minutes video to have a better understanding of the site. It is totally worthy to visit even to make comparisons with the Forbidden City in Beijing."
Beautiful space with lots of green and buildings in various states of ruin/restoration. Lots of flowers around for Têt. Really great to be among Vietnamese people enjoying their cultural heritage.
"I would allow yourself at least 3-4 hours for this. I would also recommend a guide to ensure you are seeing everyone and getting told important information.
Check the weather and dress appropriately - it is quite warm walking around - and wear good shoes. Also, pack food!! There is only a vendor serving 2 minute noodles and snack food... We were very disappointed with this."
"This is a very large area to explore, in many places bullet and war damage is still visible. Some of the buildings need tlc."
"We visited the citadel on Tet, New Years day in Vietnam. Lots of Vietnamese families were there, all dressed up and taking pictures of each other. It is a nice Colourful place, but unfortunately a lot of it has been destroyed during the Vietnam war. It is worth a visit, but nothing like the forbidden city in Beijing."
"Yep this was a very interesting place to visit, destruction from the various wars notwithstanding. It is easily accessible and takes a while to wander about. You can't exit from where you came in so the exit a long walk off to the side. Funny!!"
"free admission (bonus!) and seeing many Vietnamese families enjoying their history and culture was great.

Quite the spectacular complex - much bigger that expected.
Being decorated for Tet also made the already impressive more so."
"Worth a visit while in Hue. Although much has been destroyed in many wars, there is much to see. Allow 3 to 4 hours to walk around all of the site - there are a few English scripts around detailing what you are looking at and the importance. Best to go anti-clockwise around the site, rather than follow the flow."
"Of course it's worth a visit , Hue the imperial capital ! The area of the citadel is enormous as we know from walking around half the perimeter looking for the entrance . Make sure you come in the main entrance . Some of the buildings have been restored to their former glory ,but most of it was bombed to ruins during the Tet offensive in 1968. The history of the imperial family is shown with photos from the past in one building . But walking around the remains it is hard to imagine how the whole place worked , would have liked more exhibits and models of the palace in former times .
Realising the tourist potential , the authorities have begun a programme of renovation . In some ways it will obliterate the history of the place but can understand why it will attract future tourists.when we visited the main entrance area is under construction and renovation ."
"If you are going to be in Hue you will see the Imperial City. Don't spend more than 1 1/2 hours there. It is nice and there are nice remnants of days gone by, unfortunately with some really nice items pocked by bullet holes. It is impressive."
"Firstly, I cannot understand the comments regarding overcharging/short changing etc. The entrance fees are clearly marked and surely even the simplest person can check that they have been given the correct change. We were greeted at the desk with a very cheery 'happy new year"" . Pleasantries were exchanged, as were tickets and money. The greetings continued as we passed through the ticket check.

The citadel itself is OK. Still suffering from the ravages of the American desecration. No doubt this will be sorted out in due course and there is evidence that at least some of the very reasonable 105,000 VND admission fee is being directed towards restoration."
"The Citadel is where the emperors and their hundreds of wives lived. Nice set up! The French influence is much in evidence - think of a Vietnamese Versailles. It's partially reconstructed, so there is an evocative blend of faded ruins and brilliant red lacquer and gold renovations."
Take a buggy round and get a guided tour allow a full day. Take water with you because shops inside.Get lunch in the bus station $3
"We have seen a LOT of historical places around Hue, and this was the last one on a very busy day so I might not be fair in My judgement.
The surroundings outside the citadell was more interesting. Fantastic flowermarket, nice wooden sculpturessculptures to purchase.
Tired feet, so we took a taxibike and looked at the streetlife for a while, that was a nice experiance."
"I have spent 2 days in Hue. It is definitely worth organising a guide for the Citadel, there is not much information otherwise. I have also visited 2 tombs, a Pagoda and the old arena (tiny but lovely) with my moped driver Vui – worked out perfectly well and comparing it to the prices further South it was also much cheaper (But do haggle!! Felt safe as a single girl and his English is ok too - mobile 0945288097). I can´t remember the names of the 2 main tombs, however they are ""same same"" and it is much better just to visit one of them and then maybe the newer one that is all dark outside/Gothic style with the stunning mosaic interior. It also makes sense to time in well - do the tombs before lunch and the Citadel after to avoid tour buses."
The Vietnamese have an odd approach to 'preserving' ancient artefacts. In many cases what they do is rebuild it. This was the case at the Citadel. Parts of it look really great until you realise that it is only a few years old. That said you do get a feel for how majestic and immense the Emperors rule was. Incredible to think that it only died out relatively recently. Worth a visit and a look around
"Definitely get to the Citadel and Imperial City - it was fascinating as well as gorgeous! We went through on a grey and drizzly day, and it was still amazing! Make sure your camera is charged, because the entire place is scenic and you'll take a ton of photos! Plan on several hours, and just wander around reading the info cards and absorbing the sights. Don't rush, just enjoy slowly."
"Loved the history and the ruins, very interesting. Our guide through Travelmarvel was excellent. The citadel is still used today."
The citadel is the main attraction of Hue and is well worth a visit when in Hue. I thought it was very similar to the forbidden city in Beijing although much calmer and in a much better condition.
"Although much if The Citadel is a ruin due to the war, it is one of Hues must sees along with a few of the major tombs outside the city. It gives a perspective but much has been lost to bombs and destruction."
"We left the citadel visit until last on a separate day as it was bigger and we didn't want to rush it. It is quite spread out and overgrown though some buildings were still intact. It was still nowhere near as impressive and beautiful as the tombs we saw on the perfume river trip. The citadel is also more expensive. If you have a short time in Hue i urge you to take a trip down the river to visit the tombs instead, they were amazing and all different in their own right."
"We visited the citadel after visiting some of the Emperors' tombs and, by comparison, this was disappointing. Much of the citadel is either in ruins or has been razed to the ground. Of course, some of the citadel has been restored & these parts are beautiful but it will take another 10-20 years to restore everything. The layout is like the Forbidden City in Beijing but the nowhere near as good, I'm afraid. The tombs were a lot better"
The Citadel is a main attraction in Hue. Reminded us very much of the Forbidden City in Beijing. Plan on spending an afternoon here. Recommended.
"i would definitely recommend having a tour guide as you walk around the citadel. We came as part of a group with Sinh Tourist and it was worth it.
It's a shame that so much of the citadel was ruined by the Americans during the war, so there aren't that many buildings there now. It's also undergoing a lot of construction and restoration, so it would be good to come back in a few years when it is actually finished.
Nonetheless, it's worth a visit whilst you're in Hue. Amazing architecture and decoration."
"Great place, it's probably the reason why most people go to Hue. It is being remodeled to bring it back to its golden days, or at least to the condition it had before the very destructive war with the US. Allow it at least a couple of hours to visit it, and get a local guide. The guides are really nice, and can be arranged through travel agencies or your hotel."
What an amazing place. Definitely visit and imagine the site when it was populated by the royal family. The buildings that remain or have been restored five you a good insight but its such a shame that so much has been destroyed. We had a guide and it was worth it because there's so much to visit & its quite spread out with little signposting so I'm sure we would have just walked aimlessly.
"So much to see, you could spend several days and not see everything. Well worth a visit and absorb the history."
"The Imperial City is as impressive as the Forbidden City, and the Royal Palaces in Bangkok and Phnom Penh. It did suffer a lot of damage in Tet ""68, but efforts are being made to restore it to its original grandeur. It is well worth a days guided tour."
"And walk around this incredible site rich in history and stories. Loved it, it was an excellent afternoon. Don't miss it."
Very interesting place full of history and beautiful archtecture .Did not like the street sellers upon leaving the Citidel
"As other reviews had mentioned, by the time we had got to the ticket desk for the citadel, we were suffering serious tout-fatigue. Make sure you don't accept the offer of an hour's tour including the museum - this guides don't have access to the citadel and this tour is around the outside of the enclosure!

When we first got in we were a little overwhelmed by the tour groups thronging around, but as it happened we were in need of refreshment so headed to the left to the pretty cafe overlooking the water. In doing so we left the crowds behind and found the peace and beauty the citadel has to offer. As it turns out we only ever found crowds at the entrance way, so as we looped around clockwise we only ever met couples and small groups. By the time we returned to the entrance just before closing, all the groups had gone.

You don't need a guide once inside, we went equipped with our Lonely Planet guide which had a map of the citadel and information about each stop and we felt this was enough for us - it's a big site and we took 3 or so hours to get around all of it at a slow pace so having a guide give us extensive history and detail probably would have felt too much. So aim to arrive early to mid-afternoon and stay until closing.

Definitely worth a visit though, the surviving architecture is beautiful, as are some of the courtyards, gateways and water features. The history is fascinating and this was the first place we really felt like we started to get a grip on the chronology of Vietnam's recent past. Make sure you visit!"
"- The imperial city provides serenity from the streets of Vietnam. The whole area whilst interesting has been very damaged, and i felt we could have done with maybe a map detailing a little of what we were seeing. However it is a must see in the old capital."
"How unfortunate that most of the citadel has been destroyed by war and weather. What has been restored is impressive. Reminiscent of the Forbiden City in Beijing, on a smaller scale."
"The imperial city remains it the ancient beauty with a spacious garden. After a long day travel around this is just an ideal place for relaxing and enjoy the atmosphere. It's just quite quiet to me, so I dun like it much as other destinations I have traveled to in Vietnam."
"After walking through Hué, and getting annoyed by all kinds of moto drivers, hawkers, cycle drivers and whatever, it is really nice to finally pay your 5$ at the gate and enter the imperial city. Inside there is wide open spaces, old and new buildings, a massive garden of bonsai trees, and noone is hassling you about anything, unlike anywhere else in Hué."
Beautiful place. Shame it was so damaged. Would recommend it. As in most places in Vietnam price for a tourist is higher than for a local. Still cheap.
"The Chinese influence on Vietnamese culture is very apparent at the Citadel from the architecture styles to the Forbidden Purple City. Of course, since China occupied Vietnam for more than 1000 this is not surprising."
"Make sure you have plenty of time to roam around the citadel. We spent all day and still didn't see everything. The temples, houses, pools and gardens were really inspiring. The restoration work very impressive too....just hope they don't over restore everything"
"The rating reflects the fact that although the place is interesting & this is modern day history & the pomp and ceremony was still taking place in 1945, the signage and information provided is poor. I suspect this is because they want you to pay for a guide but it was 105k VND so I think a useful map or leaflet should be included. We went at 3pm which was good because there weren't hoards of tourists but we didn't manage to see it all as by the time we got to some areas, they had already been closed up. So, suggest you try to get there maybe for 2 at latest. There are also renovations going on so the library is closed & the main gate is covered in scaffolding & plastic sheeting. Worth visiting."
"The Citadel is quite an awesome set of buildings within massive walls. It was not easy to find the entrance (only one entrance sells tickets, but several will let you out). It takes quite a while to walk around, and I'm sure we didn't see everything. However, we did come back for a musical performance in the theatre there, with dance and in traditional costumes - find out about this at the gate or on the website, it doesn't seem to be heavily promoted but it should be, as it was a highlight of the trip, and we were in an audience of 6, with 40 or so on stage at times. It's worth reading up in advance on the stories of the Purple Forbidden City, a smaller version of China's Forbidden City. Sadly quite a few buildings were destroyed in the American War (as it's known in Vietnam) but rebuilding is underway. It will probably be magnificent on completion; at present it is a mixture of whimsy and awesomeness."
"A massive historical site which is badly damaged but they are trying to restore it. It's fab to walk around.
However it would have been nice if they provided a leaflet with information about the admission price, history and like a map of the citadel."
Very cool to walk through the ruins of the palaces and temples without being disturbed by tons tourists.
"worth a visit for the history & just to have a wander, nosing around. 5 complete buildings withstood all the ravages of termites, tornadoes & B52s, and these have been too well restored for my liking, seeming too modern now but that is the way here, and there's more work being done."
"Badly damaged by war, this 200 year old citadel is being restored to its former glory. Large areas are empty but some of the rooms justify the visit with their exhibits"
"This shows the lives of the Emperors from 1802 to 1945. The Citadel is laid out in large grounds ame although there are numerous signs in Vietnamese, English and French, it would be most useful if the authorities produced a leaflet showing more detail to go with the admission price. Some of the rooms and explanations give a real sense of what the Emperors life was like as an absolute monarch"
"Being in Hue many times, the most impressive thing reminding me of Hue is the beautiful atmosphere of serenity and nostalgia. My favorite attraction is the Citadel which had been glorious for nearly 150 years in the history. Whenever I come there, I always stand in the main building, keep silent and try to imagine that the kings were there, was trying to think of the best way to manage the country from foreign schemes and obstacles as well as protect their beloved family. I love that place as much as its every corner can evoke profound thinking and emotion from my soul, just as if I was a guru who is concerning the destiny of the country…"
"The Citadel was one of the highlights of our visit to Hue. It's currently in the middle of restoration works, presumably because it's low season, so the occasional sight is mildly marred by tarpaulin, but it's actually really good to see the work being put into the site.

It's quite expansive and a number of areas have exhibits, like one on official papers signed and amended by the emperors, so a thorough exploration of the Citadel could take four or five hours. We arrived around 4 o'clock, so not far off the 5.30 closing time, and we managed to get just about everything in within that limited timeframe."
The History and the enormous size were impressive and our tour guide was very knowledgable. Very impressive!. .
"Take a really good day to fully explore this ancient site. Whilst some areas have been destroyed, there is enough to captivate you - including lots of museum pieces and information on the past emperors! It is also amazing to know it was still in use up until the mid 1900's"
We spent a few hours wandering around the site. Enjoyed going down into the command bunkers. We walked to the site from our hotel in the city centre.
"Our group was fortunate enough that we had a tour guide to walk us through most of the grounds and explain many of the temples, graves, pagodas, and other parts of the ruins on the expansive grounds here at The Citadel (Imperial City). If traveling without a tour guide, then I would strongly suggest reading a lot of research on the Imperial city as a lot of the place is mostly in ruins and it would be difficult to appreciate certain areas of the grounds without having the knowledge beforehand. We were also given a lot of time to walk around on our own to spend more time exploring the grounds

There are a lot of temples, ruins and so many beautiful entrance and exit gates all around the grounds. Our group spent less than two hours here, but one could easily spend a half day here. Highly recommended viewing, but make sure you have a guide or do research about the grounds."
Interesting and tranquil. We spent 6 hours there on a pretty warm 'winter' day. Did our own tour using guide book for details and this worked pretty well. No food at the one cafe open and we hadn't come prepared with lunch.
parts of it are being renovated but its still a good place to visit i could have done it part of a tour but prefere to meander at my own speed and enjoyed the history.
well worth a visit but take time and be prepared for lots of walking.lots of the original buildings have been destroyed during the war but restoration is ongoing.
"We all really enjoyed visiting the city and learning all about the history from our guide. The city is in ruins due to natural disasters and war, however what remains is truly amazing to see. However I believe that the experience would have been a lot less rewarding without a guide to give you lots of interesting information about the site. There was a television playing a clip with information and some signs but I would still recommend visiting this site with a guide. Overall, it was a very good experience in Hue."
"I was only in Hue for a day so thought I'd visit the Imperial Citadel as the main tourist attraction. It was remarkably empty so no problems getting to see all the bits that you want. The architecture is interesting and there are small exhibitions explaining aspects of imperial life. However, I did not use a tour guide and therefore found some parts of the citadel quite dull as there is little or no explanation given in many parts. The citadel is not particularly dramatic or awe inspiring and definitely not my favourite of the many sights to see in Vietnam."
"The citadel is truely impressive. If you're a history fun you would enjoying reading the descriptions of imperial life in the main building left in forbidden city and extensive reproduction of royal document... it is more about experiencing the feeling of peacefulness and imagination.
Please do not miss the coffe right after the south exit."
"For some reason the day we went, the imperial city was EMPTY! There is not a single person in any of the pictures we took. We loved strolling through this empty city and feeling as if time stood still."
"It is extensive, with walls 21 metres thick (did I really get that right?) and so many buildings. Fascinating. It is being restored, having been devastated by French and American warfare. It will be truly amazing when completely restored."
"A great place to wander. Bullet holes are still visible everywhere, so one's imagination can also wander back to times gone by."
Probably best as part of a tour to fully appreciate the history - however even without its a very peaceful place away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
"Lots of stories and photos of old emperors. Big site, lots to offer. I found it worth-while. Like in so many government run places one feels that there is a lack of love and care there. Dusting and polishing glass surfaces do not hurt and they make a place infinitely more attractve. After all this place represents the glorious past...
I liked it nevertheless"
Amazing site. The outer walls are 21 meters thick and there are 3 sets of walls to protect the king in the old days. Fantastic place with lots of history. Also visit the throne room. No pictures allowed in this room but that's ok. Yes some parts are still not restored but this gives you the reality how badly it was destroyed. The restored areas are fantastic and I loved the place. Don't miss it.
Definitely worth a visit - lots to see but only need a full morning to cover most bits. Truly beautiful preserved buildings and art. The museums are very informative and contain interesting photographs too. It is confusing to navigate so make sure you have a map. Don't miss out on the interesting digital presentation early on in the tour. The only problem is some areas are being redone/renovated at the moment so it is not possible to see everything.
"Many temples and other historic sites in Vietnam (and China where we visited just prior to coming to Vietnam) are so completely restored it seems hard at times to get a feel for what a place was like originally. The Citadel in Hue is only partially restored and the effect is powerful.

The restoration is wonderfully done and you can watch the workers in progress currently restoring several sites within the walls. But walk around the perimeters of the site and you will find numerous walls, gates, towers, and other features that have not been touched for at least decades, maybe over a century.

Of course, in the current unrestored state, these relics are not like they were when initially built. However, you can get a sense of the colours, textures and attributes that existed long ago when first completed. Combine this understanding with the feeling you get from the restored portions and you begin to get a picture of what might have been.

The site is enormous--the area where the huge Vietnamese flag flys 24/7 is worth the trip. The trip from the south side of town, best taken by boat along the Perfume River, is an experience all on its own."
"Not as old as you might expect and heavily damaged during the war there are only a few building left standing and they are trying to repair/rebuild the rest.

The site is interesting and it is nice to just sit and enjoy the view and relax away from the cyclos etc. Should pop by and visit as it is not a lot of money and some of the gates are quite pretty."
"we were only on Hue for one night however made the special trip to see the Hue Imperial City. This unique blend of old, war ravaged and restored history will be sure to interest most. Like so much of Vietnam, the American war has left its tragic mark with many buildings destroyed. One of the things I like best about the country is how the people's spirit shine through in the industry - rebuilding, caring for the city."
If you are going to Hue you can not miss the Citadel. We had a book and was enough to guide us around.
Been travelling to Hue for 6 years and they are constantly working on the Citadel. Can't believe how slow the progress has been given this is the most significant thing tourists come to see. Worth visiting and they do have an audio visual to see on arrival. Ensure you do stop to view this to have a better understanding of the layout of the facility or you won't enjoy it as much.
"They are in the process of refurbing the whole City, but nevertheless very interesting to walkaround."
"just got back from here, there's a nice little garden but that's about it. We came here as the unesco website showed pictures of statues and buildings that are actually located elsewhere But where part of the same era. We asked a tour guide who informed us of this. 105,000 dong is too much for what are simple ruins, nothing grand here at all. The best bit were the tanks and aeroplanes nearby the south entrance and that was free, plan another day out rather than waste your money."
"Quite a new (1800s) site but well maintained and explained and a good way to understand some of Vietnam's history.

The cyclos were sometimes quite insistent but eventually understood that we wanted to walk ..."
"A true glimpse of the past when the royal's ruled, fasinating wondering around these very large grounds of what was oncea palace and the capital of Vietnam."
"It's a big site, lots of things to see. Very much worth a visit, and more buildings are being restored all the time.
Take your time to visit, though. There's 'guides' outside who will try to sell you a one hour tour. That's way too short. Just ignore them, the place has information posted all over.
Also, avoid the little 'electric trains'. Walk the place, discover it by yourself, you'll be rewarded with lots of peace and quiet (barring the occassional tour group, but they never stay long in one place) and lots of interesting things to explore by yourself. Don't limit yourselves to the purple city. Western part is also very impressive."
they call it little compared to china purple city. saw in Singapore advertisement on tour so went for a look since there. nice. where king hold dinners and conventions if I am not wrong.
the imperial city combined fascinating history and beautiful surroundings. It would probably be worth it to get a guide as the displays are missing a lot of information. We didn't get a guide and I feel like I missed out on a lot of info. The music performance is also really neat.
"Nice for an afternoon to explore some of the most impressive historical structures in the city.
The walk around the garden areas is nice. It can be peaceful unless there's a tour guide with a megaphone barking out facts.
I did a self guided tour instead of the guided."
"The Citadel is undergoing restoration. Thanks to our private tour guide, Mr Pham Thanh Huy organised by Tonkin Travel, who timed our visit perfectly, we arrived in time to see the change of guards at the Citadel gate.
You'd need a tour guide who is knowledgeable about the ancient history of Vietnam to truly appreciate this place of great significance, its artefacts etc. Each buildng has many beautiful round pillars with intricate motifs which unfortunately are very worn out from the thousands of visitors' hands that have touched them."
Take a guided tour to truly understand the history and significance of the Imperial City. Lovely bonsai gardens snd lots of opportunity to take photos.
This is the number one place to visit in Hue. Best is to know the historical background of the place before going inside. It is a big compound so would recommend to spend enough time for this. I took a one day city tour with the Hue Rider and this was my last stop. I had to rush because I had a train trip back to Hanoi to catch so I did not have much time to enjoy going around the place. But if I would have the chance I would go back to visit again.
"Beautiful architecture, lots of space and quiet to wander around, and stunning scenery. A must in Hue - of course - and part of what makes Hue a great place to visit for those interested in architecture and ancient buildings."
"Great place to learn history of the the last imperial dynasty in VN. Fascinating, well done documentation in English and french and photos as wellas impressive buildings. Wish we hadn't paid for a guide as his knowledge was cursory and he just stood around while we read info on walls. Could easily spend 2+ hours there if history buff."
Took the bus around but had no translator. There were lots of English information and includes the war museum. Worth a look x
"Visiting the Citadel was an interesting experience. There's definitely lots to see, although many parts of it are in a bad condition (or under pending reconstruction). I couldn't enjoy it as much as I'd like because we visited the Citadel between 10 AM and 1 PM, which was probably the worst time. My three Vietnamese friends and I suffered from heat exhaustion after the visit. So, if it's summer, go to the Citadel either early in the morning or late in the afternoon. That's my piece of advice to you."
"Once inside the gates of the Citadel, I realised just how large this walled city was. It was beautiful and easy to imagine how amazing it must have looked when it was lived in. The buildings are exquisite. It certainly took 2 hours of our day, but well worth seeing the video of it from early 1900's and strolling around."
"Review is really for the city as a whole. One regret from Vietnam stay is we didn’t allow 3 days min in Hue, More to do here than we thought. Highlight had to be cycling to the Japanese bridge (Make sure you know the way before you set out but locals will point the way as you get closer).
We travelled from Hue to Hoi An with family riders (motorbikes / scooters). This was one of our favourite days in Vietnam. Check out their reviews."
"This was a very impressive historical site with lots of beautiful temples and ruins. Definitely leave a few hours to look around, as it's enormous. They are working to restore a lot of the buildings, the library in particular and the theatre is now looking quite incredible. We only had one afternoon in Hue and this was the site we decided to go for, we didn't regret it. Entrance price is very reasonable too."
"This is something not to miss. The Citadel is under reconstruction, but even what is there is so beautiful to look at. It takes you back in time. Definitely worth a whole day trip."
"You have to take a rickshaw around for a good look at it. Yes, walking it another good way to see it."
"This is very extensive, with many badly damaged buildings, but with several now having been reconstructed or restored. Allow a couple of hours to explore thoroughly. Not my favouritenplace to visit in Hue, but I guess a ""must see"""
Citadel is a must see in Hue. The restorations were great and the grandeur of what had been is illustrated well.
"A very large and majestic site the citadel is definitely a piece of history. That said, you need to Get a guide, we had no idea what we were looking at seeing as we had no guide and the meaning of the place was lost on us."
This is an amazing place where Kings were really Kings and was really worth a visit. We had a guide which helped. TV film made by Koreans was very good in the royal palace and helps explain why it was devastated. Music theatre was an amazing place to visit just underlined that these people knew how to live.
"We were not that impressed with the Imperial City- the best part was the introductory video explaining what the buildings were used for. Many of the buildings no longer exist and the rest are being restored and it was not as old as we thought it would be- it was built in the 19th century.
Again as someone else mentioned it is not worth a visit if you have been to the Forbidden City in Beijing but definitely worth a look if not; we spent about an hour walking around and it is not very expensive at 105000 (approx £3)."
"We were unlucky to get very heavy rain during our time here. Other than that it was a good trip there were a lot of unfinished buildings that had been destroyed, but there were still a lot of buildings to see and look around. A lot of the information on the displays was repeated around the site which got tiring trying to pick out the new information at different sites. All in all worth visiting, but definitely try get a sunny day"
"Very impressive. The absolute vastness is amazing. Be prepared to spend a good couple of hours here. Lots to see and lots of walking.
A must"
"The citadel is well worth a visit, but I can't help thinking that we probably missed some stuff and also rushed our way through it in about an hour.

If you have the time, get a guide rather than doing it yourself like we did."
We visited the Citadel on a rainy day and even under water the Imperial City is beautiful. A must see in Hue.
"This was the Imperial city in the former Capital of Vietnam. A palace if you will for the Emperor who took over control of Vietnam in 1802. A walled city surrounded by a moat. The site took heavy damage from US bombing in January 1968. Still under reconstruction it is a must see if you travel to Hue due to its immense size. We did a walking tour with a guide. Take a sunhat as we were recommended by our guide, there is not much shade and no breeze."
"We were greeted at the gates by friendly peddlars who sold bottled water. We bought one, having cycled from the ancient city to the citadel. And we found that the bottle was previously opened and water was probably from the river! Grrr.

But anyway, the place itself is grand amidst the ruins. You get a glimpse of how the last Vietnamese emperor lived up till the mid 1900s. You also see how the citdel suffered the war's wrath. From heydey to doomsday. Such a juxtaposition, almost made my head explode."
"You need almost a day to see everything but can get a good idea of what has happened there in fur hours. There are many displays with English descriptions that take a lot of time to read but add to the experience. I photo the written description when exhausted by the volume of information for review later. It will be crowded and hot.
The citadel is massive and impressive and a site to see but not study. The palaces and temples inside are in varying stages of repair but very beautiful with intricate work on roofs, walls, furnishings and floors. Its better if you have read up or have a guide. Wonderful place to get appreciation of Vietnamese history."
"If you are in Hue, you must visit the Imperial City. If you have already been to the Forbidden City in Beijing, I would skip this one."
"It was built in 1802 which suprised us. We expected a 15th century palace or something like that. This modern aspect made it all the more interesting because it became the last vestige of a feudal system. It is large, peaceful and interesting. Definitely worth seeing. On the way there a man on a cyclo tried to persuade us it was closed for lunch and luckily we didnt believe him. It is a scam so just head off there any tme of the day and enjoy its peace and history."
"This was the highlight for us in Hue. The citadel is grand and huge, but is sadly ruined by the war that was waged on Vietnam. You really feel angry that it was bombed in the war!
It has some really nice gardens and architecture, the main hall is brilliant, they have also created a movie in which they have recreated the entire city and then you realize how beautiful and grand it would have been if it was not bombed. Takes around 2-3 hours to walk around. Don't miss it."
"Great to see the history. We missed all the 'performances' - see photo I've attached. Traditional dance, emperor parading etc - there is a fixed schedule everyday which would add to the visit.

Also great to see a contrast of the restored and original. The emperor certainly lived well back in the day.

As mentioned previously, cyclo/rickshaw can't go into the citadel, so don't be fooled. The are only great for getting you to the entrance. After that, all traffic is banned."
"Absolutely wonderful and well worth the 110,000 dong (£3, $5). Easily walk across the box metal bridge or the one slightly down river and follow the road or walk through the lovely park, both parallel to the river. There are three ways through the wall and moat basically either side of the big flag pole, can't miss it. Once through the walls, head for the ticket office and main enter anche that is in line with the flag. There are very few signs if any and the traffic doesn't go past here, in fact it looks like it's no entry by the small traffic signs and few tourist make you think your in the wrong place, but your not, there re just very few tourist which I can't understand as it is fantastic for a good half or a full day. You can find quiet corners and whole gardens to yourself. Drinks inside are a bit pricy, 40,000 for a Tim of drink. The most annoying part is being pestered by the cycalos and dragon boat touts. Worst in whole of Vietnam !!! The cycolos we didn't use and the dragon boats, just stick to $2/each ($4 total for two) and keep walking away if they say anything more, they soon snatch your hand off, remember this is for a full 1 hour, they will try to say ok this $4 is ok but only to take you to the citadel.......do visit it, it's fab :-)))). Ps, plenty of very clean toilets inside, 2000d"
"Only bits remained from this remarkable place, but some has been restored. Reserve at least half a day for a visit. Best to come with a tour guide since limited explanation available on-site"
This place is well worth a visit. We spent approx 4 hours just wondering around at our leisure. The citadel gives in depth history of the emperors history.
This archaeological site is incredible but needs some efforts for better restoration. Lots of history to get to know.
"We were with a bicyle taxi (how tried to get more money out of us and didn't do what we said at all, watch out for that btw. They get everywhere where they drop you money) the Palace is something to see, but not that special, and expensive in compare with for example the cu ci tunnels with guide! We hadnt a guide, the sign in english you couldnt read them.
I think it is more intressting when your from Vietnam, than for foreigners."
"I visited here so long ago. It's ancient, large. Kings lived here, our guide talk us about their dialy life, that's amazing. Some kings have a lot of concubines. Most of them are beautiful, i guess that :)
I was putted on Imperial mantle and took some photo as a souvenir. i was also rided a house and feed big fish in the lake, so much fish in the lake.
You should take a electicity car when visit here."
"We spent about 4 hours wandering thru this fascinating place. Well worth a visit.

Beware of the cyclo scam. They will grab you before the bridge that crosses into the citadel, pointing at maps showing area, and highlighting that they can take you into the Imperial City.
When you walk thru into the citadel, you will see that traffic of all types is banned. And you will be stuck riding around the outside of the Imperial City for an hour."
"There's plenty to see, unfortunately the Citadel has been ravaged by the war, & after viewing the tombs you realize what this must have been like before being shelled & bombed."
"While some parts are quite nice, the majority of it was destroyed and you can only see very few things. They are rebuilding it, so maybe in 10 years it will be ready for mass tourism, for now it should be left as a side note for a short walk."
"i love all of these attractions, anything interesting history i love. theres loads of tanks and flak guns, jets and helicopters. although we didn't have it iv heard the locals riding them taxi bikes tell travellers that its closed and to go for a ride and then come back but check yourself if u feel"
Located in the heart of Hue this IS a must visit for fans of Vietnamese history. It is always under construction due to the slow nature of Vietnamese construction projects however the area is full of charm. It covers a large area area so be prepared to walk the grounds inside the wall. Best to visit on a day not raining. Read up on the history of Hue before visiting to get a sense of where it lies in Vietnam's history.
"We came to the Imperial City with our two young children (aged 2 & 4) and had a great day. It is slow on foot (we had our youngest in a carrier to move around as you cover quite a bit of ground -- I don't think you'd want a stroller here as there is a lot of uneven terrian, lots of stairs etc. I imagine you'd be moving the kids in and out of the stroller if you did bring one). The kids loved exploring the different buildings. We opted to go without a guide as we know our kids have short attention spans to listening to information and standing around in one place. We just read from the information supplied and the Lonely Planet and it was plenty for us. The buildings were very beautiful and it was great to imagine what this place must have been like when it was in operation. We spent around 3 hours here but could have easily spent another hour if we'd remembered to bring food. There are only snacks (junky snacks at that!) and drinks for sale so bring a packed lunch for your hungry children!"
"Everything about the Hue Imperial City (The Citadel- aka Forbidden City) was great for the history and culture of the Vietnamese people.
Stairs, after 4 days of Temples in Cambodia"
"Had one afternoon in hue. Only sight we saw was this. Can't imagine what else to do in hue.

We didn't find the citadel that Impressive. It was certainly beautiful, but a lot of it was under construction. There weren't many signs so it wasn't as easy to navigate as I would've liked. If I was to do vietnam again. I don't think the citadel was impressive enough for me to justify to come all the way to Hue just for that"
"I found it of great interest as I liked the atmosphere on the ruins. Many seemed disappointed on the lack of well preserved buildings but I like the ruins and ""authentic"" feeling of what once had been magnificent. The atmosphere is authentic and provides a lot to offer for photographers."
Spent two hours here with our guide whose knowledge of the history and culture of the place brought it to life. We visited in late afternoon and it was virtually deserted. A great place to visit.
"Much has been destroyed during the wars and also because of floodings and storms, but some of the temples have been restored already and even the ruins give you an excellent insight into the former times."
"The citadel and forbidden purple city was one of the reasons we chose to visit Hue. Like Hue the Citadel leaves you thinking this could be a must visit destinations but sadly it does not quite meet its promise. The city has much to offer but has not got its act together. The river frontage could be very pleasant but it is. Left scruffy, lawns unmoved, gardens just kept to a satisfactory level and heaps of garbage left lying around. This can be corrected very easily with a more civic minded local government and really not much effort needed.
Similarly the Citadel site has not been restored well enough. Lots of workers hanging around but doing very little work. They are too bored to do much other than play games on their phones or if lucky enough on a computer! The gardens and lawns are tidy but are not mown often enough so the grass is too long. The signage is very poor. Not enough directions in English. Too many displays trying to justify why Vietnam owns the Parcel islands.
The head curator should be sent to s one where like Port Arthur historical site in Tasmania or Sovereign Hill, to see how you can make the most of a historical site to be interesting.
The citadel has quiet a lot to see - the best parts you cannot take photos of though - but too little has been restored, the shows are on at stupid times I.e first thing in the morning, too little directional signage at and too the site. One simple idea would be to dress up the attendants in costumes from the ages to add some colour to the site.
Ps if you are walking to the site and use the first bridge to get their ignore the cyclo drivers who will tel you to turn right at the first entrance into the old city. They want you to get so lost that you will pay for their tour around and back to the citadel entrance. Ps you can only entere from the main gate on the river side."
"What's left of the Citadel is beautiful, and lightly attended. Bear in mind that a large part of it got destroyed by Uncle Sam in the name of freedom, or something, so you're not looking at the equivalent of the Beijing Forbidden City. (At least not any more)."
"A large complex. We walked through on a rather rainy day. It was interesting and scenic, though not fantastic. Parts of the Citadel were not properly curated and there were inadequate explanations.

A pleasant and interesting walk but won't be revisiting."
"Definitely, this is a must see when you arrive in Hue. The Citadel is surrounded by a moat along the the perfume river. It is huge. You will need to spend at least half a day here. You pay an entrance fee and you can have a guided tour but nobody was available and not may guides have good English. The is a lot of information about the all the Emperors but Hung Mieu was the main one. Very interesting diagrams and pictures to see. You are told about the numerous wives and concubines for the Emperors and the Eunuchs having a major part to play. The last but one Emperor was gay and only had one wife, and the Vietnamese are not convinced that his only son, the last Emperor was indeed his true son.It is wonderful to see that Unesco is there to rebuild what was destroyed by the Vietcong and the Americans and you can see what they plan to do with a 3D film. It will be magnificent when completed. Unfortunately, it was raining when we visited, so take a brolly!"
"Even in the pouring rain, this place is stunning. A lot of renovation work was being done when we visited so some of the decorations were covered up, but still it is incredibly atmospheric. This is a full day out, if you are able to watch some of the information videos, and take time to walk around the whole place. It is intriguing to learn about the levels of privacy that the Emperor had within his buildings - and the monarchy was only removed in 1945! Do not miss this out, even for a one night stay in Hue on your trip around Vietnam."
"we arrive hue old city on atour from asianway travel. the tour was amazing in that old elegant city.
we visit the palace, the king tomb and we boat on the river. we stay in an special hotel tht asianway travel choose for us - empress hotel that also have good location.

thank u for the travel asianway and we will continue south and update again the details of our trip

chen"
"105'000Dong is too much for this site. There are a few nice buildings, and gardens but also the history of the site is interesting especially considered that it was still in use less than 100y ago. Unfortunately many parts were bombed during the hard battle of Hue.
Locals do same farming inside the walls, just follow them in the NE corner and the entry is much cheaper ;-)"
"Massive place, lots of walking. Could do with some more descriptions and some restoration. But still, I was most fascinated by it."
We went today was ok but have seen much better a lot was under construction a few vases and things to look at not much and there was only one exit we had to walk rite around the outside to get back to our bike the guy wouldn't let us out the front and thought it very funny us having to go rite around really annoyed me
"After having visiting the tomb of Minh Mang our expectations from the citadel were high but due to the destruction during the wars there has been extensive damage and hence only some parts of the citadel remain. So architecturally and visually you do not see anything that blows you away.

At the same time I really enjoyed the exhibits which very nicely explain the lives and the times of the emperors and the customs.

In retrospect it might have been better with a guide who could have helped cover the right parts in the citadel as the information and route on the site are very less. Two hours would be more than sufficient to see these exhibits and walk around."
"Visited in July 2014, will never forget the heat. the short video presented was informative, depicted the citadel in its previous glory.

the main buildings are maintained but we saw ruins that may still require restoration. overall a good excursion."
Great history and educational for our kids .... It was raining so to access the diet on foot is not that enjoyable ...we had to buy tickets to ride on the mini 'tram'/bus to get around otherwise it round be good to walk instead...
"The best tourist attraction, even if we did ours in rainy December. The best is to just walk around and you will need half a day to enjoy it. The guides seem to speak very little English."
The citadel was an unexpected treat that the whole family really enjoyed. It was truly impressive. There is little information on site so read before you go or take a guide. A must see when visiting hue. Look for Mr hue and his cyclo for a great trip back to your hotel.
The route through the site could have been marked better. Alas it was raining when we did the trip so that spoilt it a bit
"If you go on a wetter day, it's a bit gloomy, but there are very few people who want to get their hair wet.
It's impressive, and it gives you an idea of how much power the royals had. So much money wasted on glamorous surroundings. It's amazing what they got away with.
The architecture is in quite good condition, but there is a lot or restoration going on. Make sure you pack lots of water, as it goes on forever :)"
"You can easily fill half a day visiting the area, even more if you visit the museums. OK, some parts are destroyed by the US forces, during the 1968 Tet-offensive of the Vietcong, but a number of palaces and temples have been carefully restored by the Vietnamese population. A true world heritage site. You don't need a guide to visit the citadel: any good guide book will do ( lonely planet, routard...)"
"A fascinating day spent at the Citadel showed me what was, what could have been and what still might be. So much destruction at the hands of so many men of many nationalities. I believe that, even in its current state, it is one of Hue's treasures and is well worth a visit."
"only few building remains but thanks to renovation, we see the quality of building coming back to life. it worths a visit even if it poured rains like it happened to us!"
very interesting place if you want to know more about the life of the imperors and see the citadel ( interior and design).
"You may wonder why cyclo drivers stop at this gate and encourage visitors to stop for a few minutes and look down from the top of the gate. Hue played an important part in the 1968 Tet offensive. The American forces were trying to retake the citadel from North to South (right to left as you look down from the gate) but unable to cross the small street in front of the gate. Up to this point the rules of engagement did not allow air bombardment of such an important site as Hue. To cross this tiny road the rules of engagement were changed and the rest is history. And the present. One of the few sites in the world that really allow one to understand the problems and horrors of urban warfare in the modern age.

From minute 35 see US vets talking about the battle for this tower: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uMruTd1Pwo"
"This citadel dates back to early 1800's and has had a rough time but some simple extra information, signage, maps could make the experience more positive"
"I'm ashamed to say that I had done very little research before coming to Hue so I was surprised to see 'just a bridge' in the top twenty on Tripadvisor. Thanks to TopSunFun's review further down, we ended up watching the whole episode of 20th Century Battlefields and regretted not having done so sooner. When you realise the significance of the bridge, a walk from south bank to north becomes an epic journey. TIP: If you are doing this at night (pretty) notice that the lights on either side face in different directions to avoid blinding drivers. Walking on the wrong side means you won't be able to see anything for half an hour!"
"Akin to Beijing's Forbidden City, this Emperor's residence and administrative headquarters offers some eye-catching architecture..especially the three thick and high walls surrounding it..but the visit also requires a vivid imagination because much of the original site is now in great disrepair. Samsung has sponsored and produced a very fine film featuring a digital reconstruction of what's not all there any more. If you're in Hue..this is the primo tourist site..so readf up before, bring your imagination, and do see the Samsung film."
"For around US$5, this is a must see in Hue. The architecture is gorgeous and there's also a (Korean-made) video that re-creates what the Citadel would have been like in its time."
We loved this place. You can imagine what it must have been like once and hopefully they will be able to restore in time. Such extensive grounds that must be beautiful in the summer. Beautiful even in the rain
"The sheer size of this place is overwhelming. iF you are not up to wallking long distances in the heat, take a tour, they have electric wagons/trains. It was sticky even mid December.We went there on our own and walked from the hotel. Bring water!
The entrance gate is currently being renovated as are a few other buildings. But it looks like a slow process. However , the buildings are interesting there is even a small theater that is still being used.
Due to construction the exit was 500m along the wall and because there was an outside moat you had to come back again to the gate to get across the bridge, a long detour after walking in the heat.
There was no reason we could not have walked out the entrance, no crowds at the end of the day, other than that the guard insisted it was an entrance and therefor you could not go out, no matter how much we tried."
"The visit takes half a day. The citadel is very big, contains a theatre, a college, a lot of pagoda. It looks like a system to defende yourself and live far from dangers."
"Like the temples, best to have a guide, interesting to view the photos and explanations near the shop.
Had to tun the gauntlet of the cyclo's outside."
"I drove by the Imperial Palace in March 1971. Visited again in 2007, and have driven by it regularly on four additional trips back to Hue. . Wartime damage still visible at the main gate (bullet and fragment damage); however, it's a beautiful place with tremendous reconstruction efforts to keep it as it was. Be prepared for a lot of walking so wear comfortable shoes and clothing. Carry a bottle of water or two but there are vendors. Make sure youve got your camera. Then, after you spend most of the day there, go to the Imperial Hotel to the rooftop bar and sit outside in the cool evening breezes and look at the amazing structure across the Perfume River. If its a breezy day you'll see a lot of kites off in the distance. Beautiful city. Beautiful country."
"The Imperial City of Hue is approximately 200 years old and was built when Hue was the capital of Vietnam under the Nguyen emperors. It is massive and very impressive, despite the loss of many of the buildings to termites, the elements and, sadly, decades of conflict.

The modest entrance fee of 105,000 dong (approximately £3) gains access to all the remaining buildings and the nearby Royal Antiquities Museum. You should allow half a day for the two and wear comfortable walking shoes, although there are now tourist golf buggy type buses to transport you around, as well as a horse drawn trap. On our last visit, three years ago, there was also an elephant. He was no longer in sight, although the steps to get on and off were still in evidence.

I did wonder whether it was worth returning. Yes, it is! As mentioned, the citadel is impressive. It was also good to see a number of buildings being renovated. The library had almost fallen down three years ago. Now it is being reconstructed. But they still have a long way to go, so it is also good to contribute a little to the rebuilding efforts through the price of the entrance ticket.

Another development had been the various exhibitions in various pavilions. There was one on rickshaws, another to establish the historical rights to various territories and the best related to the Ngyuen Dynasty. It was intriguing to discover that the emperors used chopsticks that could reveal if his food contained poison!

The throne hall, queen mother's pavillion and the temples venerating ancestors were the best buildings. Do try and leave time for the Antiquities Musuem, as well, as it is housed in an attractive building and has some very good exhibits (albeit the interpretation could be improved)."
"Beautiful scenery and if you can imagine how people lived back then, it's impressive. Some reconstruction was under preparation, so it'll be great. There was an exhibition of royal costumes, which was very impressive and beautiful, and an old and really nice theater with lots of ancient atmosphere. You can easily use 3-4 hours there, but no more. If you have difficulty walking, then there is a way to go from the parking lot. I thinks It's possible to issue a small cars to transport you to the gate"
"Nice site, read up before you go. Not real self evident. Can spend a long time if weather is good, (bring water and snack) not so fun if pouring down rain. (take little guided golf cart tour)"
A massive walled fortress built in the 18th century. Huge walled enclosure surrounded by a moat fed by the Perfume River. Some parts are preserved/ rebuilt but much of he buildings were destroyed by the US during the Tet offensive. Definitely worth a visit.
Buildings are well maintained. The area is big and nice to walk around in. Limited food and drinks available.
Lots of things are either run down or covered in scaffolding. Only saw one beautiful fixed building. Lots of walking... Take a history book and a map!!!
"Many buildings inside the Citadel have been destroyed, but there are enough left to make a visit of the Hue Citadel worthwhile. We were quite impressed and enjoyed almost a whole day of walking around there."
"Seems like they are renovating and reconstructing a lot of the buildings. Not many signs, so you may want to get a guide. Or read up about it ahead of time, like we did."
We did the city tour on our first day and it was all very interesting and worth doing - we were going to go to the DMZ area another day but changed our minds and instead took the train to Danang as we thought it would be an experience plus get out of the city and also see some rice fields and coast line - it was worth the trip although the 'luxury seats' were not so luxurious and the carriage had 2 tv's blasting out some stupid programmes - then the food trolley arrived - the vietnamese are tiny but all they do is eat. I spent most of the journey in the corridor looking out of the open window and trying to breath in some fresh air but would recommend the journey - only 21/2 hours which is easily doable - we went there and back in a day as was only interested in the journey.
"We spent several hours walking around the Imperial City. We got the ticket for the palace and enjoyed seeing the history that lay within. There was a good video in the palace showing digital imagery of what the city must have once looked like. It was a bit sad to think how much was lost during the wars.

We didn't have a guide, but we enjoyed walking around the extensive grounds. There are many inner walls and moats and it seemed taking different turns would lead you to hidden areas to discover. It was a little drizzly with the weather, had to be careful with your steps in some places as a bit slippery. We enjoyed how peaceful it was inside, with the hustle and bustle of the streets seeming far away. A great way to spend a few hours examining the history of the emperors in Vietnam."
"Got a long story of Hue Citadel through the Tour Guide, we were really interested with this place. It was large and may take you for a whole day to discover all but our tour was limited and we had to move to another place.
Overall, it is valued place to visit"
"I really enjoyed walking around and imagining what it would have been like when it was used for its purpose. Has such an eerie feeling to it, we'll worth a visit"
"With unique architecture and stunning scenery here, we did not waste time to visit all these places.
- the people here are very friendly, and the food here perfectly."
"Simply put, it was interesting. Much of the grounds were destroyed during the bombings from the war and they are in various states of restoration. The colors chosen are a bit ""too vibrant"" with the color intensity being a bit over the top. So you see ruins as well as newly restored areas, which is a bit paradoxical, but it should be incredible in about 10 years after all the restorations are done. Right now, it was OK.

However, the place is full of history and the displays well explained. We happened to visit in the rain, which is a bit of a drag, but it did not detract from the experience too badly. The grounds, in their heyday must have been truly remarkable. The moats, the inner and outer walls to protect from invaders, the relics - all excellent.

It was awesome. I wouldn't miss this one."
Hue is such a charming place and all the attractions are worth visiting. Our visit was made extra special by our wonderful guide Hui.
So amazing to see the restoration and learn the history a must see in Vietnam! Could spend a couple of days wandering around all the buildings
"We were superbly impressed by the Imperial City in ancient Hue. Its so huge and although just a handful of the original structures continue to be standing, the sheer imagination of the rest that might have existed during the Nguyen dynasty makes it so impressive.
It might be worthwhile going either with a guide or using a detailed guidebook - we purchased a guidebook inside the citadel itself.
There is a lot of restoration work going on inside and that can get spoil the look a bit.

A couple of long galleries with 3 d imagery, comments, old paintings and pictures help to put a lot of what you see into perspective.

The gardens are great for some photography ! We spent about 4 hours inside and could have easily spent another couple but it was getting dark."
"Take your walking shoes, a fan, and some fluids to keep you going. Once you get over the facade that is being restored at the gate, do take your time and take a guide with you through this amazing complex. Steeped in history, and still in ruins in some area, it's a work in progress in some ways. There are parts that have been restored to their former glory and that is amazing. It's nice to have the contrast between the newly restored and the old ruins. This place is steeped in history, and remember there are places where it is totally disrespectful to take photos so please do as you're asked otherwise they will send you away. There is also a documentary movie you can watch in the first building. I highly recommend watching it, because it shows the buildings as they would have looked in their heyday. Very nice tranquil place to enjoy. But meander, don't rush, and perhaps go in the coolest part of the day for the maximum enjoyment. Oh, and good bathrooms, that you have to pay for, but it's well worth it :-)"
"We arrived in Hue from Hoi An by car late in the afternoon and only had 1.5 hours to explore The Citadel in the rain before it closed. While more time to explore is always ideal, we found that this was enough time to walk around the different buildings and grounds and read many of the displays. So if you’re tossing up whether its worth if you can only squeeze a few hours in, then I hope this review helps. We didn’t have a guide but found it easy enough to explore by ourselves; there are some great visual and written displays explaining the history of the Citadel, sponsored by the South Korean government I think."
"We visited in the rain which put a bit of a dampener on the visit. Lots of history here, and with our guide and information provided on site, it was interesting."
"We were very impressed of the ruins, as there was so much of the original building left. The pictures we took turned out very beautiful even though the weather was bad because the colours are very intense and the architecture very impressive. That was a great experience"
"First of all, it's impressively huge. In one of the palace at the b gaining of the tour, an informative movie is projected. The 3D imagery and comments helps to understand its completion and imagine the life in the forbidden city. Lots of boards with pictures and details about the life of the Nguyen emperors.
Lovely leafy maze of streets.
Worth a visit!"
"There's a lot of territory to cover when touring the Citadel although much of it still has not been rebuilt. Still, it is worth visiting. Some great history of the last imperial dynasty, including photos, diagrams, and English translation descriptions. That alone was worth the visit.."
"If you come to Hue you must visit the Citadel area. Unfortunately it rained all day and that detracted from the experience, particularly given we have 2 children. That said, it was interesting and full of unique history. We just walked as much as we could, took in the main features, captured some photo shots, and enjoyed the ambience. Don't fall for the cycle-taxi's that 'stalk' you outside (claiming that the citadel is closed etc...) - just walk as much of it as you can. We also walked the back streets on our way back towards the Perfume River and that was interesting for all. Wish I could see it on a warm dry day!"
Go with plenty of time and a guide to get a full understanding of the history and the places to be seen within the citadel complex .
"I was initially was disappointed no guides were available (? Reason not clear ), but found the lonely planet helpful.There are some English signs and the introductory film is good.Would have liked to see one of the performances ,but difficult to find the times .Make sure in current weather you have good water proof shoes and raincoat.Despite rain it was still a must see place ,though my teenagers were a little underwhelmed!"
"Amazing history lesson. Just incredible! So much to see and learn, to see the impact of the war and their efforts to rebuild."
"Firstly, the main entrance is not well marked as one can easily mistake it for an area under construction since it is under repair. There is no major signage to assist you. Admission is 105,000. Keep your ticket handy to show a few times. If you need a WC when you arrive, walk through the first major building once past admission and they are off to the right. The whole area is interesting although a lot is under construction, needs repair or is simply the ruins of the past glory. I felt there could have been a bit of information at each building to make it more relevant. The gardens are in dire need of attention and be careful when you are walking on any outdoor tiled surface as it is EXTREMELY slippery in the rain. Also, there is lots of uneven ground area with large holes where one could twist an ankle. This is a place where you need to use your imagination to fill in the gaps. If you are expecting something grandiose, this is not what you will see. We spent a few hours there and feel that it is not a highlight of our travels. Have seen more spectacular, similar sights in other countries."
"Excellent visit to the citadel, be sure to catch the film in the beginning (the first exhibition hall) as it has a lot of context of the scale and usage of the various compounds. The next exhibition hall on the right is excellent and gives really good context to all the emporours through time, the customs, how the city worked and so on.

We spent a good three hours wondering around - lots of opportunities for photos. We spent a while just sitting in the little gardens with a book. Refreshments are expensive inside so bring your own. The free museum included in then price is small and not particularly interesting in comparison to th citadel itself."
"I had no idea what to expect when I came here. But this place was interesting. Some parts of it were all ruins and some parts were newlybuilt up. It was interesting to see the big difference of what it was now and how it had been, and and get a thought of how it could have been looking when it was all new.
On the downside there were lots of constructionworks everywhere, and I tjink maybe they could have closed some areas down while buliding, instead of buliding and digging a little bit everywhere. The walkingpaths werent all that good all the way either. Many times you ended up in a pool of water and had to turn.
Overall a well worth place to visit. All tough it was raining the whole time I spent about three hours walking around."
"Nice area to walk around with old walls and buildings. The entrance is 105,000 which is quite high considering there is not much to read in English when you walk around."
"very interesting place to visit, no expensive either at 80,000 dong entry fee. Spent about an hour walking around viewing all the tombs etc, worth renting a moped to visit."
We walked across the Truong Tien bridge to the Imperial City from our hotel. The city was so much more than we imagined. I enjoyed walking through the multiple courtyards. It was worth the visit! We stumbled upon a war museum situated far right outside the Citidel walls as well.It was a little rundown but very interesting. We were the only visitors.
"I didn't know what to expect walking through the Noon Gate, but there was so much more to the whole grounds than I thought there would be. There are the temples in the center of the complex and it's easy to walk down one side to the end or back, then up the other side, checking out the photos in the side temples (I know there are other names for them, but not having taken a tour, or had a guide, or read up on them...yet...I don't know the names) and back to the first temple inside the Noon Gate. From there you can walk around on the outer road and see the many temples there. These were much less visited by tourists and really peaceful and enjoyable to walk around and see. Also on the outer track is a large, beautifully maintained garden w/ countless bonsai trees and other plants, and a cute red wooden bridge which is nice for photos.

If you don't have a guide, all is not lost, as many people on here seem to think. There is some info available, and quite a lot in one of the temple rooms specifically. Also, sometimes things can just be appreciated for their beauty, engineering feat, creativity, uniqueness, etc., as I believe the temples in the Citadel can be. Finally, it's pretty easy to read up online about everything you can see in the Citadel when you get back to your hotel/home.

Tickets are 105,000 dong per person, and if you walk the entire grounds it would likely take a few hours at least, maybe half a day. Definitely worth a visit!"
This was very helpful for understanding the more recent history of Vietnam. Hard to believe this was still going strong in 1945. It helps to understand what Ho Chi Minh was rebelling against.
"If you're going to Hue mainly for this, it's not worth the trip. We had walked the majority of it in about two hours. Some of it's in English, but not a lot, and there is a lot of ""this could have been interesting...""

The non-production side of the Hall of Mandarins was the most interesting part, spent a good amount of time there reading about the daily lives of the emperors and the people.

I would not recommend planning a trip to Hue with this as the highlight."
"This place is really fantastic! In spite of rain, it was a great pleasure to visit it. The Citadel is about 5 square kilometrs region surrounded by triple walls, inside there are numerous old buildings belonging to former Emperors. The Purple City itself has been destroyed, but all other places are astonishing. It's worth visiting it and having in mind cheap flights available in Vietnam, taking even a one day trip from HCMC or Hanoi seems to be a good choice. And even when it rains. Fantastic! Aah - and a day in Hue is quite enough. The city itself is bothing special, but The Citadel is wonderful. Must see!"
We attended this attraction as part of our Intrepid tour and it is awesome! What a huge city with walls still standing the test of time. There's still 3 temples standing which are wonderful to look at. This place is amazing!
"Take your time visiting this site. We arranged a private tour so as to not be rushed. Standing on the foundation platforms of the Forbidden Palace and looking out at the destruction--just empty grass fields remain-- is a stark reminder of the intense fighting that took place in Hue and the great loss of life in the surrounding areas.

There are a couple of buildings on the grounds that are done in French colonial style which I found appealing. Check out the schedule of performances in the theater. The show was enjoyable and worth waiting for. At least 5 people must purchase tickets before the show goes on-cost about $4. )"
Some parts were under renovation. Historical monument rivaled by Angkor Watt. Have a private tour more relaxing and can be more educational.
This would have been an exceptional place to visit before complete destruction by American war. Make sure to see a pre-war real picture of the complex in History museum in Ha Noi. This is a French photo from earlier times and gives perfect idea of past glory. Such a pity that it was complete destroyed in about 1972.
Great historical site and once a beauty but sadly due to wars not much remains. In fact the only quadrant remaining is the temple and the gardens and theater. Good news is the city/country/UNESCO are working to restore it's once grandeur. Recommend waiting few years for them to get it updated.
"Though impressive, going without a guide is definitely a mistake.

The complex is extremely vast and there is little offered in the way of guidance to show you where you are or what you are looking at: therefore it is hard to not wander aimlessly without instruction. Without knowing their importance, most buildings also look the same.

Further, as a product of the Vietnam war, most of the citadel was destroyed. Therefore a large portion of the buildings which currently exist are recently rebuilt reconstructions and are surrounded by large vacant spaces where old buildings used to be.

Finally, be careful in the rain. All the paths become extremely slippery due to mould and the many dirt paths throughout the complex turn to mud."
There were not so many people there at that time... the place is gigantic. It was well kept and clean. One can go through at one's own pace and leisure. The essence and atmosphere of the place was amazing. Have some good walking shoes on
"Wow what a place...it boggles the mind to think about how the place was built. It is so impressive to see and experience, it really is hard to believe!"
"We walked from our hotel in the centre of Hue to the Citadel and once there the size of the site is very impressive. They are still restoring the site after almost destruction in the wars, however seeing some of the destroyed areas is also impressive.

We spent around three and a half hours in the citadel area. Well worth the 105,000 VND entrance fee. Limited refreshments available within the complex."
"This was a very interesting trip. But I advise people to bring a good guide that knows not just the story about the citadel, but also some of the stories about what went on in there, behind closed doors sort of speak. Was very educational and interesting, and the best part of being in Hue as far as sightseeing goes."
Very interesting place indeed with loads of history and fascinating stories.It is a massive place so don't expect to see it all.I would recommend taking the transport available which is a large golf cart otherwise you will be walking all day and still not see it all.
"We visited here with our guide as part of an Archers tour.
The whole area is huge with quite a lot of walking involved, there are several large expanses of grass. I would recommend going with a guide or a very good guide book as there didn't appear to be much information. There are some interesting buildings, with some restoration going on."
"We arrived in Hue early morning after taking the train from Hanoi, and we decided to head straight over to the Citadel for some history. We arrived before mid-day, but can honestly say if you really want to take it in fully then you should arrive early as possible so if you do completely visit the site you can enjoy the rest of your day.

Unfortunately it was raining, and I always feel the rain takes away some of the beauty from these types of attractions; nonetheless, a great day exploring and learning much more about the history of Vietnam prior to the War (take time to read all information, or alternatively go with a tour/guide for some more in-depth knowledge, but not essential).

Considering the majority of it was destroyed in various conflicts and wars, I simply can't imagine the beauty of the place prior to it's destruction, and although there are restoration works being conducted on the site, I don't think it's going to be completed any time soon!"
"I am not a fan of imperial city as I have visited too many imperial city in Beijing, Korea etc.

The site is undergoing some refurnishment with additional new buildings , which at times I feel change the entire ""feel"" of what an imperial city should be......"
"This was undeniably a beautiful place, although some renovations were going on, but some things would have improved our experience:

we went without a guide, on a very hot day during the shoulder season. This site is huge with a lot of dry grass and nothing much to see in the middle and between buildings, so I would say we could have expedited/improved our visit by sticking to the perimeter of the site.

Another thing to note is that there is not a lot of signage around, and so it is very difficult to understand how the different parts of the site related to one another unless you read ahead.

Overall interesting and beautiful site, but plan your way around it before going to get the most out of it."
The Imperial City is stunning and it's the perfect place to enjoy a peaceful day out while embracing some local history. People around town will offer to be your guide but if you choose not to have a guided there will be information boards all over the citadel. You can also take a horse and buggy around the inside of the Imperial city. One of the buildings has been turned into an art school and if you're there at the right time of day you can hear them playing traditional music. Be sure to bring an umbrella or wear sunscreen because you're out in the sun the entire time!
"Despite the large number of tourists it was still amazingly peaceful, you can barely hear the traffic and are surrounded by history. There are information boards everywhere but some are so faded they're illegible. Best to take a guidebook too to understand what you are looking at. Renovations are ongoing and they are doing a good job. I spent 3-4 hours just strolling around and had a great time. Highly recommend it!"
"The only example of an imperial city in Vietnam, damage that war is been there, the restoration of this site are quality, nice work"
"We've bin on a 2day tour with Thinh and it was really inspiring, beautiful and fun!! We recommand it to everbody because it is so much more than only a 'touristic tour or attraction'.
So...jump on his bike!! Greets from Holland, Willeke & Roy"
"Not that it is not impressive. Not that is not full of history. Not that it played such a major role in the history of Vietnam, But it is new. Newer the Versailles or Sans Souci. And much, much memorable. Somehow it is a pity.
However: Look for the Golden Fishes in the ponds. And you can find very interesting genuine antiquities at very good prices. A special note for the paintings shop. Some good works again at good prices"
"Vast and very grand would some the Forbidden City up. You need to allow a fair bit of time to see all the various buildings and the grounds. I enjoyed the visit and found it very interesting ,it must have been some place in its hey day ( and my forte isnt history !) Grounds are well maintained and huge-wear comfy shoes! Well worth a visit."
"I loved the history, and that it is slowly being rejuvenated. This palace was once a glorious place, and evidence of its glory abounds. It is huge. Be prepared for a long walk"
"The Citadel is huge and generally well-preserved. It's a very interesting place to walk around and our guide was very good at explaining the history. We came across a small group of musicians playing traditional music, which added to the atmosphere."
Get an impression of how the Vietnamese Emperors lived in splendour before Vietnam was struck by war! Although the damage inflicted has taken much of this site's buildings it is still an impressive monument to Cietnam's rich heritage and thanks to the work of UNESCO should be around for a few more years yet!
"The Citedal is huge. We went on our own and spent over 6 hours here and still did not see everything. Tourist on tour seen to go to just the central area, but the Citadel has so much more to offer. We spent 30 minutes in one of the gardens without seeing anyone else."
"We visited this site as a part of a tour. There were lots of tourists here but the site was very interesting. It is modeled after the imperial city in Bejing and is a window into Vietnam during the time of the emperors, the last of whom abdicated in 1945. I especially enjoyed the museum with photos showing the life of the last Vietnamese emperor. Many of the building are being restored due to damage during the war. A must see during your visit to Hue."
This would be as famous as the Forbidden City in Beijing had not the americans not had a spot of bother crossing the road at the Dong Ba Tower on the eastern wall of the walled city: they called in air strikes and you are looking at the results. It will still take decades to re build and the experience will only get better and better.
"Very similar to the Imperial palace in Beijing a huge area to cover best get the electric cars if you want to visit everything, If you like history you should hire a guide you learn so much"
Take your time lots to see and explore but make sure you have a hat and water if its hot. Great to see some of the old ruins and imagine what might have been a must do when in Hue
"The Citadel makes a fascinating visit. We spent much longer there than the guidebook stated. Fascinating, even with the damage from the American war."
Interesting but expected more. Entry fee is high compared to other places and didn't think it was value for money. A lot of building work and restoration is underway so may be improved in the near future.
I rode my motorbike into the Imperial City and was blown away by the walls. the ancient city still stands. A place to go for a nice little walk about.
It is something to see---and walk around. Very impressive landscaping as well-bring lot's of film--and umbrella
"I was really impressed by the Imperial City. Because of the amount of destruction caused by the French and American wars, an awful lot has been destroyed but a lot is being restored with the help of Unesco funds. The place will be much more impressive when most of these works will have been finished (especially the main entrance gate)
That being said, it is certainly worth visiting.

Keep in mind that it is huge (6km²) so make sure you have good shoes and plenty of time.
."
The wall around the Citadel was left relatively unscathed from the wars and was impressive. The towers were also impressive but quite dirty. The inner part of the Citadel was being restored and was a good indication of what was here. Did a group cyclo tour and viewed as part of this. Worth a look.
The Citadel is really nice - the walled city is very large so lots of walking. The colours of all the different houses inside the city walls are fantastic. The flag flying over the citadel is the largest I've ever seen. The history boards inside the buildings can sometimes be a bit hard to take. Life was and still is very tough.
"This is a place that just gets better and better from the moment you pass through the outer main gate then through the inner main gate, shortly after which, you arrive at Thai Hoa Palace where they received foreign dignitaries in the old days. Then, behind Thai Hoa Palace is the beginning of the Forbidden Purple City which branches out to left and right, and the left side especially goes pretty deep into the part called the Queen Mother's residence area with its own set of buildings and there's quite a bit to explore and wander around in that part alone (the left side of the Forbidden Purple City which is like to the back then turn left as you enter from the main front gate).

The place seemed to be under an ongoing renovation (maybe they had already come a long way by the time I visited, from the damage incurred during the Vietnam War and just through passage of time before that, for the place to look as great as it was!), and so I'm sure it will only get better and better for the future visitors. Just kind of wished when I was there that there were no water plants in the outer moat that goes all the way around the Citadel (the moat was just full of them!). The inner moats (inside the wall before going out of the Citadel) at the back without those water plants in them looked pretty good. There are also like beautiful canals and such that flow through courtyards of the buildings on the left side (in the vicinity of the Queen Mother's residence area), and so to reiterate what I said at the beginning, this place just gets better and better from the time you pass through the front gate to when you leave through either the back gate (where there's a pavilion on the wall which is now a café) or the gate along the wall on the right side.

I would just sum up this place (Hue Imperial City) as the place where you will not so much as see but ""feel"" the bygone imperial era of Vietnam by walking on the vast, expansive grounds of the place, and so I would strongly advice every visitor to the country to make it a point to come check out this place by going to Hue (the nearest international airport is in Da Nang about three hours by train from Hue).

I did this place along with the tombs of Minh Mang and Khai Dinh, and altogether it cost me 150,000 Dong (a little over 7 US$) on the back of a motorbike cab from the start at the Hue train station to the end back there about six and a half hours later, so I'd say it was a very good deal."
"i came here, felling, love, beautiful girl, Dragon boat in night river, speacial fool: Bánh Nậm, Bánh bèo, Bánh bột lọc, Mè Sửng, so lovely. In Sparkling Festival Hue"
"According to my tour guide the place is one of the few that escaped partially from the American bombardments.
The place is massive, hence start your day-tour as early as possible!
Have in mind that the area has many entrances-exits therefore if you choose to visit the place without a tourist guide but with a car driver waiting for you outside, arrange your meeting point in advance!
I visited 2 of the tombs as well and all were wonderful however i missed the last one, the Minh Mang Tomb. This may be the most scenic of all three tombs as it is located near a lake. When i reached the tomb was already closed however i had a walk around the wall-fence and i managed to see of how the area looks like inside by looking through some holes from the main wooden entrance door."
"The is a lot to see inside the forbidden city and our 45 minutes didn't really do it justice. Maybe one for a gentle stroll around after a completed tour.
Note the possibility for a reduced price ticket to include all tombs in the area and the forbidden city. Available at the Forbidden City only."
"Sorry for the rhyming but this place is gorgeous and has an interesting history but you need someone there to explain it. Our guide wasn't very knowledgeable but what she was able to share was prime, such as why certain fixtures were around and how they were used. Don't forget to see the car as well that was owned by the monk who lit himself on fire for Buddhism. Some places were being renovated and there weren't many signs or plaques to explain- but somehow their absence really contributed to how authentic things felt."
Interesting buildings but you need a guide for background information. A lot of walking so a few more seating areas would be nice.
the citadel is huge and great with many attractions inside. it is a must see place in hue. allow 2 hours to visit this great city.
While there is still a lot of restoration work needed this should not deter you from visiting some brilliant old buildings and learning its history. Easy to spend a whole afternoon there.
"After extensive destruction, the place is being renovated extensively. Must visit to complete a visit to Vietnam."
"This site is very evocative, and spread out over a large area, but not much really remains after French and US wars. The computer graphics and models are worth seeing to get a perspective. Hopefully they will reconstructed a little more. Expect a good walk."
"In poor condition, not much signage, lakes/ponds low on water, no real paths, etc.. But still reasonably interesting"
"I didn't like this place too much but my travelling companion enjoyed it.

There's masses of old buildings with not a lot of information. A lot of the place is also under construction.

It was like I would think the forbidden city in China would be like while it was being refusbished.

There's not really a lot of information in the area which is why I think paying for a guided tour might be a better idea.

If you like history and have time to read up on this place or can get a guide, I think it's worth while going here."
"The Citadel was absolutely beautiful, but far bigger than I had expected. And there is hardly anywhere to buy drinks or food when you are in there so tip: buy water before you go in! The whole place is worth exploring but you will need some time for this and don't forget your camera!"
You can spend a whole day walking around the Imperial City. Pack a lunch and eat it in the gardens. You can also inquire about performances in the Royal Theater.
"It was a nice walk around the imperial citadel. You get to know the history of ancient Vietnam by walking around here. Too bad the citadel was heavily bombed causing extensive damage. Quite repetitive at some parts, but had a great time there nonetheless."
"First important thing to say is that the place is pretty big. Don´t expect to get a good view in an hour. You´ll need at least couple of hours! But it´s worth wandering around for the day or afternoon. It´s very peaceful, beautiful and atmospheric even tough many things are undergoing reconstruction. Remember to take enough water and maybe an umbrella with you on a hot sunny day."
"Firstly, GET A GUIDE! Seriously, I don't see the point in wandering around ruins if you have no idea what you are looking at, or what the significance of something is. This was our second visit (1st visit in 2010) and it was wonderful to see the restoration work that had been completed since our last visit (things do happen slowly in Vietnam) and the restoration work currently underway. Vietnam is a country with a complicated and very interesting history, so this place, I think, is a must see (as are the tombs). Yes, the cyclo drivers and street sellers are annoying, but it's just part of Vietnam, so get used to it and go with it. If you politely tell them ""no thank you"" and MAKE NO FURTHER CONTACT OR CONVERSATION they will leave you alone. The minute you strike up a conversation, they think you are going to buy, so don't be tempted."
"Amazing and interesting but goes on and on, bizzare tennis court in the middle of the ruins
lovely gardens towards the back"
Nice grounds but many things undergoing reconstruction. Still worth visiting and wandering around for the day or afternoon. Easily accessed as it is at the center of the city
"Give yourself few hours to explore, the site is pretty big. Personal highlights were the bonsai gardens north of the north-eastern gate. The information about the site's geomancy was interesting too."
"This place is enormous! We tried to make sense of it on our own and did get some great insights but found it difficult to get an overall impression. Directions around the site not clear.
Go with a guide if possible. We should have done that."
The atmosphere alone will take you back centuries and I was amazed at the architecture of that time.
"I was pleasantly surprised at how much has been restored! My expectations from tour books and TV shows had been that the war destroyed most everything to rubble.

Not true. While not all building are restored, many are. Gives you a perspective to how things looked and felt and how big the place was.

I recommend a visit to Hue for a day just to see this!"
"The entrance was shrouded with tarps and frames, as it is being repaired. Hue was the imperial capital of Vietnam from 1802-1945, when the last emperor abdicated the throne. There are many significant pagodas and temples, as well as the grand tombs of the Nguyen Emperors. Topiary in the gardens is lovely, as are some of the intricate mouldings on stairs and building surrounds. I loved the large golden dragon in the central courtyard. The mosaic floor is beautiful in one of the display rooms. A huge bronze pot was used to pour boiling oil over enemies. Such a historial site."
"The citadel is interesting, yet most of it is gone/wrecked. Imagination is key here. It might be handy to ask for a guide, as most signs are not very long. It also takes rather long, so plan enough time to visit the entire thing."
"Big and bold, the Purple Forbidden City looks impressive from the outside, but once inside the promise fades. Still worth a visit though. Make sure that you take a cyclo around the OUTSIDE of the City and that they can speak English. We got a guy who witnessed the war as a kid and it was fascinating hearing his stories. Choose wisely."
"This is a vast attraction to visit. They are trying to make good damage done during two conflicts and various civil unrest, it's a Huge task. What is there is worth visiting and with the size of the place and different walks along canals and lakes you could be here for best part of the day. Will be fantastic if it's ever finished"
"Good place to visit and would recommend you do it without a guide as good signposts in Vietnam, English and French. And it's walking distance from the main town so good value"
The site is large and takes a while to walk round. A reason for this May be the lack of signage or indication of the best route to take. Maybe a guide would be a good idea if there's a few people to split the cost ! There's a great little cafe inside a quiet Pavilion which serves really good cheap coffee with free tea
I was a bit disappointed as expecting to see more architecture. Still a fair amount of restoration work needed to be done.
"We loved the citadel & were surprised at how long we spent there - 3 or 4 hours! There is lots of walking & you just keep finding new places as you wander around. It wasn't v busy when we were there & we really enjoyed peacefully wandering around. It would be good if they provided a map though! The price in was vd105,000 & well worth it - no comparison in value to the tombs which were 80, 000. If you can only do one thing in Hue, do this! We are planning to go back in 5 or 10 years time to see the results of the renovations. Think it will be awesome when these are complete."
"There was a lot to see here, & we enjoyed it. When we were walking through the many areas, we thought back to the Forbidden City in Beijing. Seemed like we had access to so much more here."
"I admit I didn't do my research before showing up at the Citadel. Unfortunately, at that time, I was starting to get hungry, I was wearing flip flops, and I waited until the afternoon. Make sure you arrive well fed in the morning and wearing good walking shoes. And bring lots of water!

I walked around for about 4.5 hours and took some great photos. I found the whole complex fascinating. However, I was very disappointed that for the relatively high entrance fee, you do not receive a map or any information, and the signs throughout the complex are sparse (sometimes, you can't tell which structure they're referring to, and sometimes, they are too faded to read).

If I could do it again, I would hire a guide or see the complex as part of a tour, so I could have more context."
"Interesting and cultural but ran down.
You learn some of the history of Huê and how it has change during the years.
This is a must do when in Huê as is probably one of the few attractions there."
"The whole complex is quite big, make sure you reserve a couple of hours for the whole visit. Most buildings have been reconstructed but they look like if they were actually 200 years old."
The citadel is large and be prepared to walk a great deal to see the whole complex. I would recommend getting a guide to take you around. Much of the place is under renovation but I actually liked seeing it in its original state I do hope they do not sanitise it too much - well worth the visit.
The Citadel is the no. 1 sight to visit in Hue. Meanwhile a lot of retauration work is in progress. The restored buildings are impressive and a walk around takes about 3 hours.
But not wonderful - again this is the only time you come so you must come and see it. Consider a lot of walking and Viet are crazy on driving so watch out! Bring depending on the time you are here an umbrella as sun is HOTTTTTTT
"This is a huge historical site rich in beauty, and well presented. There can be lots of walking so wear appropriate footwear. I could have spent all day here."
Its a lot of walking and very spread out but well worth seeing. Watch the video near the entrance to get an idea of the lay out.
The renovated parts of the palace are very beautiful and give a good idea of the past. For those parts destroyed during the war one needs some fantasy.
"We went to see the sight today and were a bit surprised by the prices. In our guidebook, the prices are 50.000 VND, but it was actually 105.000 VND.
The sight is big, impressive and best seen on a sunny day.
Still, on a rainy day like we had, it is a must-see here in Hué."
"We were expecting more of our visit - we were rather underwhelmed. There is still quite a lot of renovation work taking place, but eventually it will be impressive as the grounds and gardens are extensive. We did enjoy reading about the emperors and mandarins and the large collection of photos was very interesting."
Some of the buildings are currently undergoing rebuilding work. However for the historical significance the Citadel is well worth a visit.
"I visited the palace late afternoon and was great, as there was not so many visitors at the time.
Seems to be the restorations work still going on in most of the area but this is the place you must visit when go to Hue"
"There is no clear signs to tell you which gate is the entrance. If you look online it tells you it's the gate behind the flag tower. However there are fences and gates with no entrance signs on both sides. There are also lots of pushy official looking people all around lying to your face and telling you it's shut. Similar to the scam at the grand palace in Bangkok. Apparently to get in you just step over the small fence and walk up to the main get anyway where they charge you 105,000 VND to get in which is pretty high for Vietnam. The women at the gate will try short change you so make sure you pay attention. Even if you are just wandering around in outer complex you will be harassed non stop by cyclo guys who follow you even after you've said no three times and been quite rude about it the third time. It's a shame as it is suppose to be hues main tourist attraction"
"It's a large site so make sure you have comfortable shoes on. A lot of the city is still in ruins, but the bits they have restored are colourful and explain the history of the old Emperors. You need a guide to explain what's where and how it figured in the day to day running of the city."
The Imperial city in Hue is quite impressive. Even if a large part of the city has been demolished there are still some great temples to visit which are in good condition. With a guide it took us half day to visit which was enough as we were travelling with our young son.
I was here in 1995 and it was pretty much just a few buildings and a lot of ruins. Now they have restored and rebuilt a lot of halls and other buildings with lots of color. Its a large area to walk with a reasonable entrance fee.
"Very intriguing from a Western perspective of the very rich Eastern culture - particularly how the royal family lived and governed. Well maintained, presented and we had the good fortune to have a well informed personal tour guide. One thing that strikes you is the size of the place. The intricacy of some of the artefacts was impressive. Recommend a visit when in Hue."
"** this review mirrors my review of the Forbidden Purple City as it's the same place.

We did this attraction as a part of the Intrepid Northbound 10 day tour. While I guess it's something you should tick off your bucket list if you come to Hue, don't have any expectations that it's going to be awesome.

The parade ground and flagpole are very impressive, just the sheer size is impressive. At this point, you haven't entered although it is all part of Ancient Hue and the citadel. You enter the main gate (which for us was wrapped in scaffolding for restoration) and come to a pond full of goldfish. They're massive and if you put your hand over them, they think you're feeding them and will come out of the water.

From here, you head to the main palace. I will admit here, things are perfect and very articulate. The palace is impressive when you think of what architecture was like in the 19th century. Unfortunately (and understandably), you can't take photos here.

When you leave the palace, you have pretty much seen everything although you've only probably covered 5-10% of the citadel. Everything else is in quite a state of disrepair, maybe for a reason but other things seem to have no real reason for damage. There is a lot of overgrown lawns, construction sites, blocked off parts and just empty space. Personally, I would have found this more impressive as a representation of what it was like when occupied by the Nguyen dynasty as opposed to it being left to age and ruin.

You will regret it if you don't go, however go with low expectations so you're either not disappointed or it exceeds your expectations."
"There is not a lot left of the original buildings and you really need a guide to explain what is what as little written info provided on site. The complex is run down and needs some serious maintenance to preserve what little is left, esp as World Heritage listed. It rained heavily during our visit and poor drainage meant the paths and open areas were flooded, making it difficult to get around the site."
"The citadel is a huge place with a lot of historical aspects.

In addition this was one of the places for the intensive battles duing the Tet offensive, from which the scars still shows."
"A huge area to cover so make sure you are wearing comfortable shoes!
Very interesting to see how the country was run with emperors and how they became the emperors!"
Really brilliant spot to see the history coming alive. You will need several hours and the photo opportunities are every way you look
"although much of the palace was destroyed during the bombings of the vietnam war, this is worth a visit. It was the palace of the last Vietnamese royal dynasty, the nyugen."
This is a stunning place with so much to it. We could have stayed all day. I'm pleased the ticket money will go to some of the restoration of this palace after it was so badly damaged in the war.
"If you have been to Beijing and seen the Forbidden City, you may be disappointed in the Hue Imperial City. It lacks the grandeur, color and collections that you might expect in such a place. Nevertheless, it is worth the visit.

The Citadel is surrounded by imposing walls. When you enter there is a well done film which gives the history and layout of the Citadel. It is well worth watching since much of what is shown in this film is either in ruins, missing completely or not marked.

My suggestion is before you go, read up and the history and do make sure you watch the film.

Be aware that some of the house hold good of the royals is housed in a separate museum a few streets from the Citadel. I have heard it called by different names, Hue Royal Antiquities Museum, Museum of Royal Antiquities and others."
"A must visit. It has fantastic architecture and interesting history. I couldn't stop taking photos! Definitely take ample water and protection from the sun as it covers a large area, a lot of which is uncovered. Current entry price 105,000 dong which also gives you entry to the nearby museum."
"The Imperial City is big. Hue is hot. I'd recommend getting this out of the way in the early morning if possible.

That said, it's a very impressive part of Vietnamese history and there is a LOT to see. The entrance fee was the most we paid out of all the sites in Hue (105,000 VND / 5 USD), but it's obviously still very cheap comparitively.

A lot of the city is still under renovation and reconstruction has been slow. I was here 3 years ago and expected there to be much more to see - sadly, much of it if the same. The main gates into the city are being renovated at present but I'd assume this would be a priority. They were beautiful on my last visit 3 years ago.

I would say in you're in Hue, you should spend part of your day here. Avoid the heat."
"Be sure to get a good guide. The buildings that remain (the royal palaces were destroyed) are accessible and beautiful. The tilework, especially on the library, is stunning."
"Absolutely stunning citadel. The ancient ruins are fascinating, and a great place to explore for a day (you don't need longer than a day though!).

Its rather exposed, so take ample sun block and water - the water available to purchase was ridiculously expensive (for Vietnam prices!)

A very worthwhile visit - you can see the bullet holes from tommy guns from the war"
"This was amazing. The history of Vietnam is so diverse. It's been invaded by the Chinese, the French and the Americans. The history is old, violent and interesting. Well worth a guided tour to hear the history and immerse yourself in ancient stories of bloodshed and family feuding."
I love the architecture with a very strong Chinese influence. Like the isle with the red doors. It took minimum 1 hour if you wanted to really explore the whole area.
When you walk the imperial city it is not hard to imagine the royal courtiers and mandarins wandering the area. The buildings are magnificent and are well worth the visit. If you enjoy history this site is not to be missed. Highly Recommended
"A must see site in Hue. We had a very quick visit with only the highlights due to time. Our guide arranged a vehicle to take us around more quickly than walking. Much reconstruction has been done and there is much more to do. Bullet holes are still visible in various walls. Colorful ""changing of the guard."""
"We went with a local guide, who told us about the history and customs as we walked around. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes!"
"This is the largest attraction in Hue in terms of size. It has many building and grassfields. Most of the buildings still under construction and not ready for exhibition. Yet, the entry fee here is the most expensive in all of attractions in Hue."
"In Hue I spend two nights only and for this Citadel you need half a day. Busy with renovations, still much well-kept and ready to be seen."
"The Citadel occupies a substantial area and was layed out with much thought given to providing a functional complex well suited to the private needs and public duties of the emperors. Sadly, much damage was done during past wars and although a UNESCO site the rate of restoration is painfully slow; this is sad because it could prove a tremendous attraction for visitors to Vietnam.

Hopefully, the modern day mandarins in Hanoi will come to recognise the value of investment here in distant Hue and ensure that greater funds are directed to this worthy cause."
"Beautiful ancient town, well conserved over the years. If I can give any tips, it would be not to walk around the citadel around noon. The city's walls cause a microwave-effect, which makes it unbearable at this time of day to walk around the citadel."
A really neat place to walk around for an hour or so. Many cool picture oppurtunities. We took a boat to get there down perfume river.
"Very easy to walk or bicycle round, no need for taxis or tours unless you want to do it with a guide, 105,000 dong entrance fee tothe Citadel which is well worth it. lots of coffee shops and cafes around the walls, great piece of Vietnamese history"
"THe Citadel is very interesting and similar the Beijing's Forbidden City and worth a visit, it is surrounded by an impressive moat and walls. Some of the areas damaged by American bombing are being restored to their former glory."
The Imperial City is very imposing and magnificent. The area is enormous and for such a vast site the entry fee is very generous and reasonable. The tour we went on was very enjoyable and interesting. It was great to see the area and learn about the history of the country and the area. Worth a visit and will take about half a day if not a day at a slower pace
Lovely and stunning. A must see in Hue. A short film in English is presented in the first building that really helped explain it all. Go and do a must for you!
Quite interesting site. What made the trip really enjoyable was the great service provided by the tour guide and driver.
"To see the Citadel can take some time as its an enormous area ,We saw buildings getting renovated and glorious red lacquer walls with gold relief work, its a credit to the people of Vietnam, they have protected these treasures I'm sure at times with great difficulty."
"I thought that the Imperial City was beautiful. It was an interesting mix of areas that were totally renovated and looked like movie scenes and other areas that were atmospheric crumbling architecture over grown with lovely flowers. It was definitely worth visiting (the entrance fee was 105,000 D I think) and I had a wonderful time strolling through the large grounds and imaging what it must have looked like when it was in use. I would have spent more time but it started pouring cats and dogs and I had to find my motorbike driver. Definitely take the time to visit if in Hue!"
"Be prepared for a lot of work being done as a lot of restoration is taking place, but it's amazing to see some of the old mixed in with the new. You need at least 2-3 hours to go around."
"Entrance fee is 105 000 vnd and they don't even give a map or any explanation of the site.
You can visit only a fews building cuz all the others one has been destroyed during the war.
You can watch a short video about the palace which is very interesting!
And the site is very peaceful!"
"You can't go to Hue without seeing the Imperial City. Allow at least 2h, or more. Be prepared for a long day of walking, but it's worth every step and dong that you pay"
"Citadel was a bit like the Forbidden City in Bejing withsame idea.
Pity that the Vietnamese idea of renovating/conservation is to pull down and rebuild new. Luckily this hasn't happened so much here.
All the wars have helped to demolish a large part. It is worth a visit and you won't regret the time spent"
"I have seen it many times now and every time I find something new and interesting .The history is well worth following the stages of the restoration ,as it shows a different view of it ,every time .A ,must see ,when in Hue and easily accessible by foot . Meander in your own time and discover a wonderful part of Vietnamese culture ."
Interesting historical site in the early Capitol city of Vietnam. We were fortunate to see the colorful changing of the guards ceremony; novice Buddhist monks; and a dance performance in addition to the ruins of the Imperial City.
"Worth a visit but really lame in comparison with other, similar, sites. The Forbidden City in Beijing is a far better example of this kind of structure and has a real history. The regime celebrated here only took power in 1803 so it is, comparatively, pretty new and restored to boot. OK if you are in Hue but nothing to go out of one's way to see."
"We walked all the way from the Imperial Hotel, and it wasn't bad--maybe 25 minutes. There is a safe walkway on the bridge, separated from traffic. Borrowed an umbrella from the hotel for the sun... More walking in the Imperial City--we were there 2 - 3 hours and saw pretty much everything. There are occasional benches and shade and a couple of lovely spots next to ponds with lily pads to enjoy an icecream or even beer. Prices not bad."
"Huge place so take your time. Also it is of benefit to take some time to learn of this site’s recent (late twentieth century) history. This will allow you to appreciate what is being restored/replaced and is missing.
If you visit on a hot day take lots of water – there is shade but it bakes!
Some of the site is somewhat overgrown but these are mainly the result of war damage. The walls and moats as you approach are massive. The Main Gate is one of the areas of restoration and should look good when complete. The gardens are excellent and well cared for.
We spent about three hours there but it could have been more."
This massive site housed the Kings of Vietnam and is well worth a visit. Enter from the front and have a driver or taxi pick you up after walking through the entire grounds.
Very interesting - a must see in Hue. Really gives you an insight into the history of Vietnam. Allow at least 2 hours.
This imperial city in my opinion was better than the forbidden City in China. It was smaller but so beautiful. Really enjoyed the tour of this former capital of Vietnam. A must see in Hue
"Thankfully for us we found a motorbike tour that would include time to see the Hue Imperial City - better known as the citadel. I am so glad that we did because this place is truly amazing. Obviously some areas are now in need of repair and restoration, but some parts of the imperial city still look like they did many years ago. This place is vast, I mean really quite huge, so make sure that you take in plenty of water as there isn't really anywhere to buy it when your inside. I really can not champion this attraction anymore is was wicked. This was the only place that we visited in Hue and I am glad that it was included in our itinerary. Truly Amazing!"
The main entrance was under construction and quite a few parts of it are being restored. The parts which have been restored are very good. A lot of it is just ruins and the site is not well kept with weeds and long grass everywhere. We both commented that it needs better upkeep.
"A must if coming to Hue - it's what it's famous for. Cost is just over £3 and expect to spend 2-3 hours at least here. Much of the original site was destroyed during the French and US wars which is a tragedy, but there is still lots to see and learn and there is a considerable reconstruction and preservation project ongoing. Refreshments available at various locations."
Don't be fooled by the streets lined by trees. The sun will eat you alive. Great for visiting the Purple City and other sights in Hue. Beware of shenanigans trying to 'show' you the way.
"Site had a sense of grandeur about it, particularly liked the gardens. A lot of temple and religious content, but that's the way they lived. Some areas damaged by war and nature are being rebuilt so will be replicas, but based on what is done already it would be near impossible to tell. A good standard of renovation"
"Loved the Citadel. If you go there a tuk tuk via central Hue, make sure they take you via the 'garden streets' Truly a breathtaking & unexpected experience!"
this tyour was organiosed by the hotel imperial it is so worthwhile walking around that city is breathtaking although it is under reconstruction in a lot of parts it is well worth a look i would highly recomend a guide thougha s they know their history
"It is a stunning place that was partly destroy during the American War. The conservation is good but someworks are still needed. You need also a good orientation sense if you want to visit the site by your own. It is big and everything is not that well indicated.

It is annoying there is an entrance for Vietnamese and one for foreigners and the price is clearly not the same."
"The ruins have history and what`s left of them is beautiful, especially if you do a little bit of research beforehand and if you use your imagination. The staff is not helpful at all, most of them don`t even speak English and there are no signs to indicate where the Royal Museum is. Most people I met were wandering around clueless and ony found it by mistake. A proper map would be useful. Also, you need to pay for parking and toilet."
Vietnam's version of The Forbidden City. Great historic site. Expansive grounds. Important site for understanding the history and culture of Vietnam.
"You can not go to Hue and visit this place. It is such an important part of their city and history. It also has many lovely gardens.

We walked across the Perfume River from our hotel, then as it got hotter, it was only a few dollars taxi ride back to central Hue."
"Loved the citadel. Arrived at the theatre in time for the performance in there, which was really good value. Amazed at the opulence there must have once been. Also amazed that in the 20th century, people would drop bombs on such places. The grounds are large, give yourself a good couple of hours to get around and check it out."
Impressive grounds and interesting history. I went with a guide and I think if I had gone without one I would not have gotten much out of it.
"The Nguyen Dynasty ruled Vietnam from 1802 to 1945, though the latter ones were little more than playboy puppets of the French. They lived in luxury and built this palace modeled after the Forbidden City of Beijing. Unfortunately, after the Tet Offensive of 1968 we spent nearly a month trying to dislodge the NVA from Hue and in the process turned much of the palace into rubble. In 2014 it was still largely in a ruined state, with ongoing reconstruction of several buildings, but still fascinating from a historical perspective. The Duc Chuong Gate on the east is one of the finest I have seen in Asia. About a block beyond the gate is an on-site museum housing many personal items of the ruling family. And several blocks farther is a history museum with examples of all major eras of Vietnamese history and a large collection of heavy weaponry from the American War. A massive wall encloses the Citadel, and the flag tower at the entrance is impressive. Nine massive bronze cannons guard the front gate. The sun can get brutal inside the Citadel, but there are corridors inside which will shield you from the sun and offer benches to rest. If you visit the Citadel, I recommend also seeing one or more of the Nguyen Imperial tombs just a few kilometers south of the city. Also nearby is the Thien Mu Pagoda with an impressive tower and the Austin motorcar which drove Thich Quang Duc to his self-immolation on an intersection in Saigon in 1963 to protest the policies of the Ngo Dinh Diem government."
"The Imperial City is certainly worth visiting but be aware it was damaged significantly during the war. Restoration is being done as quickly as possible but there are alot of areas that do not exist any longer. A guide is important although there is a very infomative video being screened on a continuous loop.
It was extremely hot the day we visited and there was little air movement due to the high outer walls.
Lots of steps and some rough terrain."
"Just amazing. I've recently toured the Forbidden City in Beijing, and other palaces in Xi'an, Seoul, and Kyoto. While this one isn't as well preserved, it compares favorably with the others. Signs in Vietnamese, English, French. Lots of area remains in ruins, but plenty is being renovated beautifully."
"We visited this place in one day, we hardly had time to have a break, but it was really really worth it. It was very nice to see how the life was for a long time ago."
"Getting there is half the battle, walking along Le Loi street etc kept getting asked if we wanted a motorbike or cyclo, got a bit annoying. We walked across the bridge closest to the Citadel. When you get through the first gate there are some cannons and shade. The entrance is directly in line with the huge Vietnam Flag about 400 metres away. Even this close we still heard a hapless traveller being told it was 10km by a cyclo rider who wanted to take them all the way around it - just walk.
We mostly used the Lonely Planet Guide. Definitely watch the animated video when you go in for an overview of the history and what used to be there. 10 minutes well spent."
Fascinating piece of relatively modern Royal history. Our guide was very knowledgeable about the history of her city
"My family of two adults and two children visited the citadel in early October. It is a fantastic site of historical and cultural significance. There is clearly a focus on protecting this site. Some parts have already been renovated whilst others are under going repairs. The work done so far looks great. My theory is that in order to protect places like the imperial city in Hue, it's worth the 'small' inconvenience of some renovations, it's just a part of travel!

There is a short video that explains the renovation process and it is worth a watch, but look for the bench at the front on the right hand side as there is a nice fan to give you some respite from the harsh heat that you will endure.

One suggestion I have is about the electric cars. We were pleased we paid the extra money, but we're disappointed that we had paid for 60 minutes and the driver ended the tour at 50 (this also happened in Hanoi with the electric car tours, better check the time when you start any timed tour). When I quizzed him, he drove into a rather shabby part of the complex and said 10 minute here.... We got out a little confused and he drove off, I was not impressed. I walked back to where I had paid and complained, they were apologetic. Hopefully it won't happen again. It may be a small complaint but we were extremely hot and but that time it was after 11am and we needed all the help we could get!! My tip would be to ask for a 45 minutes tour, it's actually better value anyway!

All I'm all though, it didn't mar what was a fantastic morning of wandering and exploring a little bit of Vietnamese history!

Another tip, water was not too badly priced as another post suggests. We bought a large bottle of cold water for 25000. Pretty good for inside a World Heritage Listed Site."
"We spent a good few hours wandering around the Hue imperial city, having visited the imperial city in Beijing last year, we were interested to compare the two. Whilst the Hue imperial city is not as well preserved, I actually enjoyed it more, it was so colourful and presented us with some great photo opportunities.

There was not a lot of tourists here, so it was easy to avoid the crowds, at one stage we were the only people in an area that used to be a royal residence, it almost felt like we had stepped back in time.

The grounds are large so if you have any issues walking it could pose a problem, although I did see little golf carts that I guess took tourists around the whole sight.

It certainly is an interesting place to visit and I highly recommend it. I know a lot of people miss visiting Hue when travelling to Vietnam, but it really is a great little city!"
I read so much about this place thus decided to visit. There were not many tourists during our visit and we spend more than one hour. Honestly we did not cover the entire place which was really huge. We spent more time around the main areas and noticed that the grass was unkept in certain areas.
"Much more extensive than we expected and also more intact than we had been led to believe from the guidebooks. Very informative exhibits in Vietnamese, French and English. We spent several hours exploring. No guide really necessary which allows you to relax and explore at your own pace."
"When you are here, you could sense that there was no genuine interest in the preservation of the citadel and ancient monuments. Got cheated at the gate, I wish I had read about the other reviews from this forum beforehand. I think it is all about dongs here than actual architectural conservation."
We were here as part of an Intrepid tour so had a guide with us. It would not be the same without some local knowledge.
"There are plenty of reviews of the Imperial City so I'm only reviewing one aspect that is sadly not publicised very well - the music and dance performance in the Royal Theatre inside the Imperial Citadel. It is a half hour performance twice a day and consists of some music from a traditional band and three dances - Unicorn dance, Fan dance and the spectacular Lotus dance. The theatre is beautiful and the music, dance and costmes are great. Unfortunately this performance is not well advertised (the Citadel staff couldn't tell us anything about it - I just knew from previous visits). We (4 of us) were the only audience today. Don't miss this show (10:00 and 2:00 each day)."
"The citadel is great, as a historical place, but not as a sightseeing attraction. It's pretty much destroyed and although they are renovating it, there is still a lot of work to do. I'm not saying not to go, just don't expect too much"
"It is 10km in circumference and a labyrinth inside - this forbidden city of Hue which is slowly being rebuilt, pavilion by pavilion and palace by palace. Some original buildings survive and some are in the process of restoration, but many are vanished with only rubble remaining. Those buildings completed are a taste of what is to come, and of the opulence that was"
"The Imperial Complex in Hue has immediately gone into our 'world top 100 sites' list.
We followed the suggestions of others - giving the exact money for the ticket and taking umbrellas to shade us from the sun.
We gave ourselves five hours for exploration which was about right.
We got a great deal from reading all the interpretation boards and looking at all the black&white photos on exhibition in the shady corridors.
There's no doubt that the restorers are doing a fabulous job. We came away thinking we had a real feel for court life - far more so than on our visits to Beijing's Forbidden City.
Don't miss - the cafe on the wall by the North Gate; the formal gardens in the North-east sector; the Royal Antiquities Museum just outside the East Gate and included on your ticket."
"We spent hours here looking at all of the fantastic buildings and roaming the grounds soaking up the history. Also a word of warning beware of the odd snake or two in the long grass, although I think it was harmless it is still worth keeping an eye out."
While some of the place is under construction it really is beautiful to see. I would definitely recommend going in the morning before it gets too hot to walk around. For me this was definitely the highlight of Hue. The ticket also included a visit to a nearby museum which was not worth visiting as it was nothing compared to the citadel. I would definitely advise you to bring an umbrella and your water with you because it gets very hot walking around and water is so expensive in there.
"We visited on Sept 23 and the front gate was under construction. So were many of the areas. A few parts have been renovated, but many areas still need work. It's good to go and see if you're there, but I wouldn't go out of your way to stop on Hue for this specific site while under reno."
As a former soldier and student of history and modern warfare I was immediately drawn to Hue. The city was the first of the southern cities I entered after flying from Hanoi and I was amazed at the difference in culture and how much more relaxed it was. The Citadel is beautiful and they have done a great job both preserving its history but also repairing battle damage. The people were very friendly. Try the 'Brown Eyes ' bar...
"This is by far the best site seeing to do in hue, its a big area to cover, go at a cooler time of the day as it gets very warm."
"Old and scenic... was not kept properly by the government (at least so far, 15% is damaged due to natural reasons)"
Great site and well worth a visit. Bring plenty of water as Vietnam is very warm and humid at the best of times and you'll need to keep in good shape to see all the Citadel. Parts of it are quite ruined by the American attack in the 60's and 70's however restoration is taking place and parts look very well.
"One of the main spots to see in Hue, definitely worth it. It's quite big so either you can walk all around to see every corner or just select a part of it. There is not that much left, a lot is still in ruins, but enough left to get a good idea of how it was before.

I think two hours is enough to see all of it. Of course you can stay shorter or longer depending if you just wanna quickly take some pics or enjoy relaxing on a bench or under a pavilion somewhere there."
"As my group and I had no choice, we visited the Imperial City of Hue during the warmest hours of the day, but it was definitely worth it. One needs plenty of time to wander around and see the parts which have already been restored. There were some very interesting exhibitions of old photographs and we could get an idea what life must have been then.
However, when we were ready to leave, we were not allowed to exit through one of the three arches at the main gate where we had got in and we had two options: either to pay in order to take the electric car, or walk around for some 15 minutes to the square where the mini vans park. We found that unacceptable as it was obvious they did that to make us use the electric car. That annoyed me and my group members, as tourists shouldn't be treated that way!"
"I was so excited to see this given its UNESCO World Heritage Status.

It was nice, but not so majestic. (I found the kings' tombs grander). Maybe because 70% of it was destroyed during the war, according to our guide. And most of what we saw are just restorations."
"amazing place, advice to take a walk all through the erea, take your time as there's much more to see than you might think first of all."
Lets face it if you visit Hue you are going to go here. Do it as part of a bike tour like Hue to go.
"From what I had read, I expected the site to be in much more disrepair....in fact, there was much to look at and a stunningly beautiful site. You get a real feel for how things once were and if you have the time to wander, you will get the most out of the experience. Count on at LEAST a half day!"
"A really interesting and atmospheric sight. Lots to see and walk around however there is much restoration work to be done. Some whole areas are still ruins.
Definitely worth a morning looking round. There is a video explaining the sight so you will have some basic info."
"A great place to visit if you like visiting temples, pagodas, and royalty sites. It's huge. Make sure you take an umbrella with a reflective inner lining to ward off the sun — the heat can be oppressive here all year long."
"It was quite difficult to imagine how this Imperial City should have looked when it still belonged to the Emperor. It is such a pity that most of the buildings were destroyed during the Vietnam war. Regarding the video that is shown, Unesco hopes to restore most of the buildings to the original splendour. The entrance fee of $6 is a little bit steep for what is on offer."
"Much of the structures inside the walls of the Citadel and in particular, the Forbidden Purple City, are but rubble. If you're going to visit, you'll need a guide to explain the significance of the various buildings."
This very impressive landmark is not only an excellent reminder of the rich history of Vietnam but also to its consequences of the Vietnam war. A sure visit for everyone.
"To see and hear about the great emperors of Vietnam, where they lived for centuries, and how this ancient city played a part in the VIetnam war, is truly amazing. A must see for any traveller."
"Enjoyed visiting this ancient place and trying to imagine it as it would have been in its original form. The informational video was very interesting and showed recreations of what the Purple City and surrounds looked like in the past. There are displays of old photographs, seals, huge bronze basins, ornate artwork and architecture on the recreated buildings and plenty of rubble of the original stones.

The war really ravaged this city and you can feel the devastation as you walk through the ruins. I especially enjoyed seeing the intricate artwork done as part of the old walls (chips of porcelain vases etc captured as part of the tile decorations).

As at August 2014, this cost us (foreigners) a 105,000 VND (about R53.00) entrance fee, which was a little more than we were expecting but it doesn't break the bank if that is what you came to see. It was also extremely hot to walk around (no bikes allowed inside the paid entrance part) and water was more expensive than outside. Take hats, sun cream, plenty of water and a few snacks so you can enjoy your day."
"I loved this place, even if it is a little bit destroyed by war and time, it is still magical to see and to imagine what it was in it hey days. It does give you a good perspective of how life was back then."
"nothing disliked, it is the heart of Hue's tourism. If you missed this place, you missed Hue. Although I came here twice, it is still attractive for me."
"The citadel is massive and takes more than 4 hours to explore the entire grounds. Many of the structures are in various states of reconstruction, but it is well worth the visit especially if you enjoy history and photographing historic architecture and artifacts. Easy walking, but take plenty of liquids. Guides are available and provide a lot of perspective and insight."
The Citadel is certainly worth a visit. It is quite run down but has some nice buildings and some interesting architecture. There is enough inside to keep you busy for an hour. In all honesty the price was a little high for Vietnam.
"A must see in Vietnam, and the reason to visit Hue. Restauration is ongoing, and is been done in a good way."
Hue doesn't have a ton of things to do but this is one of them. Its nice seeing the old culture but most of it was destroyed. I'm glad they have restored half of the structures here so it gives you a good perspective of how things once were before war came along.
"Hue is a lovely town to visit - very chilled out, with a few cultural sites such as the Forbidden city and a number of beautiful tombs and pagodas, but you should be able to cover the most important sites in 1-2 days.
The Citadel is massive and definitely worth visiting. There are lots of reconstruction works going on at the moment, so it is expected to be even more impressive in a couple of years time. I also enjoyed the tombs.
I'd also highly recommend visiting Hoi An if you have time. Take a tour bus as only tour buses take the scenic mountain route along the coast, whereas normal commute buses take a shortcut through the tunnel."
"Hi!

We discovered the old citatel in Hue with a private guide, named Tran van Thinh. He has a deep knowlegde of the town and it's history. He lived in Hue as a child during the war and after that he lived for 11 years in a Buddhist pagode. We sat in the front of his cyclo as he drove us trough the city. We liked the tour, so we decided to book a motorbike tour with him for the next day. A great choice. We drove from Hue to Hoi An. The route is really stunning, especially the mountain pass nearby Danang. We stopped at the Marble Mountains, a fishing village and a nice waterfall where we could swim.

We can recommand him because he is a nice guy, he knows a lot and he is a save driver. We really enjoyed our tour with him.

Kind regards from the Netherlands!"
"It was very confusing where to buy the tickets to get into the Citadel. But the place is very beautiful. We were there early in the morning so it was not (yet) crowded. We walked around quiet a bit and it was, once again, beautiful! But at some point all the tempels, etc kind of look the same after a while.
I can definitely recommend to go early in the morning to avoid the big crowds and take some time to walk around and bring enough water."
"The imperial city is relatively expensive for a Vietnam attraction - VND105,000. If you can pass yourself off as Vietnamese you can get in for free at a gate next door (right-hand side) of the tourist gate. The city would probably have been beautiful in the past, but it's poorly preserved and not that much remains now. There are two slightly brashly reconstructed halls, and one or two original interiors. There are also some preserved exteriors and beautiful lakes. Hue itself is a typical Vietnamese city - hot, dusty and noisy. The imperial city is worth going to if you are in Hue anyway, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make a special trip to either Hue or the imperial city."
"A great experience, a hot day bring an umbrella to shettler you from the sun. It's worth booking a guide to get the true information."
"Fortunately a great part of the old palace and temples are being restored. It is a very impressive complex. When visiting during the warm/dry season, I would reccomend to visit the Citadel in the morning or in the afternoon. Since it is a very big complex, with little shades."
Spent a couple of hours here in August. Really interesting though the majority is destroyed. Definitely a must see when in Hue.
I didn't know what to expect in this city but when I got there I learned so much about Vietnam history and the royal family. Beautiful tomb of the last King and the palace is interesting too. I learned a lot going to these places
"it was good to see and was interesting, i am glad they have tried to recomstruct the houses following the bombing in the war it brings back some of the culture. worth an afternoon."
"There's lots to see here and it's so peaceful. It has a certain ambience and appeal, well worth the entry fee and the sore feet at the end."
"Great to ride around on a motorbike, But inside was destroyed, so they are attempting to rebuilt it with modern materials. Asian conservation is very different from western. Stick brand new cement & bricks on old foundations."
Nice complex of temples and good information boards to fill in the gaps. Pity the americans destroyed so many buildings in the 'American War'....you have to imagine what it looked like.
"Even though most of the Citadel was reconstructed after 1975, it looked like it needed another reconstruction. I am glad I went once since I was in Hue, but its not worthwhile to see twice."
the citadel or imperial palace gives a good idea how the emperors where living ; the whole citadel is of course a sort of forbben city like the one in BEJING but absolutely nice to visit.
"Found the place to be very interesting, lots of history, shame that it was mostly destroyed by the French and Americans. Nice to see some restoration being under taken though. Sad to see the litter everywhere. If your looking to spend a good day out with the company of a good guide this is a great place to do it. The miniature models give a good idea of the scale of the place in its former glory."
A huge place where you can do a lot of walking there is plenty to see if you want or you can do a short visit & concentrate on the important parts. It isn't really worth the walk outside the walls to the fine art museum as it doesn't add to the visit. I found the building in the citadel on the right more informative. Make sure you watch the short video that they have running & bring plenty of water. It was very hot in August so an early morning start is advisable
Well restored after being destroyed in World War 2 and the Viet Nam war. Artifacts have been duplicated and the layout painstakingly restored.
"Taking a midium tour aroud the citadel was useful for us. Thank the tour guide who speak English and Japanese very well. She provided and answered any questions that we asked.
The most we like when visiting the Citadel wa the architecture. This was what we sould learn. Over years, it has been in good condition and preservation.
The Citadel impressed us so much."
"Though wars, fires, typhoons, floods and termites have all taken their toll, it's these Imperial edifices, some now restored to their former magnificence, that constitute Hue's prime tourist attraction. Try to visit the Imperial City early in the morning, when tourists still take its breakfast, otherwise the place is crowded with both local and foreigners."
Really can't leave Hue without seeing this ancient site. It's magical. The grounds are tranquil and to imagine the royal court. Really a lovely way to spend the an hour or two.
"We took a dragon boat over ($1 per person) and walked back which took about 20 mins. Really interesting to see how closely traditional royal life similar to Chinese royalty. Allow a couple of hours to meander thru different buildings and gardens.
We were lucky enough to do it on a rainy/overcast day but would think it would be hot otherwise. There is quite a bit of cover though and some leafy lanes to choose in some parts.
Cost 105,000 VND - $5us"
So much to see. Take a step back in time to an era of emperors. You can spend all day there and not see it all. Very hot in middle of day so sun hat and plenty of water. Worth a look for history buffs
"If nothing else the sheer size of the Citadel will take you aback. Some of the buildings are fully restored, others are little more than rubble. One of the most interesting things is a photo exhibit which shows old photos of ceremonies that have taken place there. I down-rated this location because despite the guidebooks saying entrance fee is free or ""symbolic"" the price tag was not. They have a price for locals and one for foreigners. The one for foreigners was far from negligible. (I enjoyed the tombs more.)"
"one hour walk in the Citadel definitely worth your visit during your time in Hue. The Citadel is very peaceful and charming, colorful and beautiful. One advice: believe me, do not take the cyclo or the electric car, it is useless, only use this when you are an elder traveler."
"Hue's Citadel and Imperial Enclosure are well worth a visit. The palace, temples and ruins are very atmospheric and the history is interesting. I particularly enjoyed the area of Hien Lam and To Mieu temples and the Nine Dynastic Urns. The Citadel covers a fair bit of ground, so allow a couple of hours to wander around. Try not to see it while on a day tour as these tours allow far too little time there and you will feel rushed."
"Pretty interesting historical site with many refurbished buildings, photos and reconstructions. Despite quite many structures have been ravaged by repeated bombings the remainder is worth a visit. It is very interesting to read and understand the history of the site.Enjoy."
"The city itself was OK but I have never been more discussed by the treatment of the horses here.

I found one particular horse that was attached to a massive wooden carriage, the poor animal was just skin and bones, there was no food or water in sight and he was shaking and panting, I know a lot about horses so on closer inspection things only got worse. He had infected sores all over his legs from the harness and could barely keep his head up. When I looked under the 'saddle' he had a badly infected abscess that covered nearly his whole back and fly's were laying eggs in it. I confronted the owner and was met with laughter.

I explained to people who spoke some english and they walked away and didn't get in. We showed other tourists who just laughed at us crying and paid this man for a ""tour"" of the city. This house was close to death and probably needed to be put down, If you care about animals or have any sense of empathy, please don't go here and give these people your money. The other horses weren't much better and these people shouldn't be allowed to abuse and torture animals for their own gain. Myself and my group of friends left immediately after about 15 mins, in tears. DON'T GO!"
"Amazing price of history and beautiful buildings and architecture.

As you wander around the Citadel you keep discovering more parts and more history!

Make sure you have a big breakfast, as you could easily spend 2 or more hours here."
this place has so much history tied to it especially if you are from America great and historic battle were there
"The Citadel is big!!
To get the most out of this historic site I would say you need to devote half a day at least.
There is so much information available regarding the history of this site located on boards all around the site, failing that, position yourself within ear shot of on of the many tour guides.
The whole Citadel is undergoing a restoration as quite a lot of it has taken a beating in various wars over the years, some areas are completely missing, where as other look ""over"" restored, to the point of being brand new.

Love or loath the restoration, there is a wealth of history here and its a must see"
"We were reluctant to visit Hue on our very short tour of Vietnam, but are very glad we did. The Citadel (even in the rain), was evidence of a former life. Sure the ruins are ruins, but with the information in the museum areas and a bit of imagination, this place would have been magical."
A surprising treat just north of the perfume river. The citadel and palace were constructed in the 19th century and was the residence for the last emperor. Much of the original palace and grounds were destroyed by the last 2 wars with the French and Americans. However there are still some original features. The grounds are huge and you can spend a few hours walking around. I would recommend that you bring a hat and lots of water as there are not many shady areas. There is currently a restoration project ongoing and the areas completed are sympathetically done. There is an interesting photo gallery with information about the life of an emperor. You can also dress up as an emperor and have some photos on the throne (it was very popular). I would also recommend going to the art gallery where a local artist will do a portrait (100000 dong). We had one one as a couple and the trainee artist also drew one of the missus and gave it to us for free. well worth a visit.
"It's been a such nice place I've been in Vietnam. It's very large, fresh, quite and bring Asia architecture. If you've Beijing, China you can image Hue citadel is a little bit similar from outside but it's very interesting really inside, so much different. You're keen on taking photos do not hesitate to come there right now. You won't be dissapointed. I spent 2 hours walk around and made a memorable albulm. I enjoyed traditional music there "" Nha Nhac Cung Dinh Hue"", exactly good kind of art should watch and tried Queen's clothes to become a Queen few minutes. Very good experience. I highly recommend this place for all people over the world."
"A little bit sad not having a lot of boards to explain every area.
Wonderfull place mostly destroyed but still amazing to visit for history lovers"
...it was complete. With destruction of such magnitude by both the French and the Americans you only see the skeleton of what must have been a real gem of a place. You can still enjoy what is left but you leave with a sense of disappointment.
"Once you have seen the Beijing imperial city and forbidden city you think that one build in the 19th century and destroyed in the Vietnam war, will be a disappointment, but to my surprise it was not I liked the standing parts, the reconstructed parts and some of the reminders of how war can destroy such an amazing piece of history. Recommended"
We visited the citadel and it was really interesting to walk around. There is loads to look at and explore. We spent about 2 hours here. You could probably spend more if you wanted.
The Imperial City is a beautiful spot for pictures. I strolled the grounds of the Imperial City with friends and we had a lovely time. There are so many sections to explore and wonder.
"This really was unexpected. It is a truly huge site that, unfortunately, suffered heavily from bombing by the Americans in the war.
That said there is still a lot to see and there is some spectacular restoration going on.
If you like these sort of things you could easily spend half a day if not more here.
I think this is a must if you are in Hue."
It could be an even more spectacular experience if all in the city was better preserved. The lack of care is obvious in most buildings.
The Citadel is a great place to visit when in Hue. It was great to see the sites throughout the impressive compound.
"Well worth a visit, however, as others have mentioned the heat and humidity can be problematic if you are not used to it. As the citadel opens at 7am, there is plenty of time to explore before the midday heat, and contrary to what others have said there was a reasonable amount of shade available. Be warned that water within the citadel is extortionate!"
"The imperial city is the main reason most people go to Hue, we walked the city which was a bit exhausting, they have electric cart tours (similar to a golf cart) and I think that would be a really good idea. On our last visit we also enjoyed a cyclo ride around Hue which was really good fun and a great way to see the city."
"This is a must place of visit, as it was the residence of several rulers of Vietnam even after the colonisation by France. The rich architecture and the history is well worth knowing, so a local guide is a good investment. Some buildings have been destroyed for ever. Restoration work is going on to save what is left."
Interesting but very spread out. Take good walking shoes. Too hot and no where to cool down.ok wouldn't go again
"I was not expecting much of the Citadel considering how the Vietnamese look after their official buildings so I was happily surprised by the renovated buildings there are to see. The UNESCO is clearly helping in rebuilding this amazing site although I am not too sure the money is spent effectively. I recommend a stroll in the Imperial City where life seems vibrant and brings a nice change from the Downtown Gringos.
Disappointing: It is only at the exit that they tell you free shuttle cars can drive you around so ask the driver that are lazing around (not sure which colour) if they are free. Few signs are written in English or Vietnamese. The ""cafe"" on the left after the first building with the good video is a complete rip off, don't buy anything inside the Citadel.
With or without kids: Bring at least one big bottle of water, sun hats, sunscreen and a good camera. There are some really nice gardens, moats, ponds and a few very nice renovated palaces."
"Probably our hottest day and not much shade, so you have to walk a lot, which is unbearable, in July.( start of wet season )
There is a lot of history here and it is very impressive.
Suggest you start the tour as early as possible"
"We loved Vietnam but in July the humidity of 80% is very tiring, the best time is in Spring April.
We recommend the La Residence for relaxing and luxury"
My suggestion would be to visit this site in the morning before the sun hits hight noon. There isn't much shelter from the sun and it takes over an hour to see the Citadel.
"Good to see, interesting but a couple hours is enough , include in day trip with other attractions! Overall cool thing to see and explore !"
"This is the main attraction at Hue, and I do recommend to go.

The main building with the throne, is interesting and holds a lot of history, and there are many old photographs in the pathway to the end of the Citadel, but you have to use your imagination and imagine the Imperial City before it was destroyed.

We had a relaxing day there and got a little more insight on the Vietnamese history."
"While this imperial city must have been something incredible in the past, now it's really far from it. In most of it you'll just be left standing at the ground, looking at the remaining of the foundations of some building mostly thanks to the USA bombings.

Ticket for Imperial city also includes entrance to the nearby Fine Arts Museum, worth a (very) quick visit"
"There is not so much to see in Hue. The citadel is the only real place to go.
Now, does not help that half of it was bombed by the USA during the Vietnam war... The place is still half destroyed.
The UNESCO is currently putting in a huge effort to rebuild, but I guess it will take a very long time before it all the piles of rock are put back together.
I still recommend going because it was the heart of the empire, but don't expect too much.
The video in the main building (where the golden throne is) is very very good so stop there p. It only last 15 mins but gives useful info on the site, what it was used for, a little bit of history and provides digital reconstructions of what the citadel looked like before the war.
Go, at least, with the entrance fee, you help UNESCO put the place back together."
"Very good way to waste a hours. More renovations being done all the time.

Must see in Hue. You can easily waste half a day"
It was a very big and must have been amazing before it was destroyed. Well worth the time we wandered around inside its walls.
Well worth a visit but pay the extra and get a car to take you around. Place is huge and difficult to see all of it on foot.
"Prices had gone up recently (now 105,000) but it certainly wasn't to cover any up keep costs. Would be a nice place to bring a picnic and explore, but the mismatch of bombed ruins next to restored buildings was a little odd and I probably got as much from seeing pictures of it as I did walking around."
"When we visit Hue Imperial City, we can spend 1 full day to learn about Nguyen dynasty with 13 Kings, their ruling and reigns. Cosmos Travel Vietnam Team put The Citadel into program and advise clients to do that, because it is wonderful master-piece in term of architecture, geology and historical."
"Had a great day seeing the sights of Hue city. Mr Le Cong Thanh from An Thanh Ecotour Limited was a delight and made the day one to remember. The highlights of the day was the Emperor's Tomb and lunch where the monks reside. Mr Thanh had a great sense of humour and spoke excellent English. Thankyou Mr Thanh.
Annie and David"
"We went with a guide which I recommend if you can, or go around with a decent guide book as there isn't much explanation. There is a great video subtitled in English which is worth watching to give you an idea of what it all once looked like.

Our guide explained the links between the emperors and the people, each other, the french and how the citadel was targeted during the Death Offensive in the Vietnam war. You could see original and reconstructed buildings, sat between ruins and overgrown foundations from the destroyed areas. I enjoyed it :)"
"The citadel has been 70% destroyed by wars, but you can get a good idea of the grand scale and culture of the era's that it has survived."
Fascinating way to see the imperial heritage of Hue. The site is well-preserved and easy to visit without a guide.
"Large parts of the imperial city have been completely rebuilt so dont expect any much legitimate history. Still if you are in Hue for more than a day it is worth a visit.

IMPORTANT NOTE: if you are walking to the citadel all of the bridges allowing you to get in have no sidewalks, dont worry you are actually allowed to walk across the road (this being VN where anything goes)."
"The Imperial city itself is very nice, I would say it is a must visit in Hue. Apart from the reconstruction site, Imperial city still have its royal theatre and temples which is quite impressive from its pillar's design to it's garden, everything is carefully carved."
The Imperial City made me want to write books about the royal families of Hue even though I am not a writer. It is an interesting place with character and many stories to tell. Very hot in June though so maybe not the best time to walk around this large establishment.
"Very well taken care, the explanations were clear and the movie that described the development and history was enlightening
worth the visit"
"We made the citadel our first stop in Hue, arriving there about 8.30am. Already all the English speaking guides had been booked so we went without one. I know we would have understood the history better with a guide, but we could absorb the physical beauty and complexity of the Citadel perfectly well for ourselves. It takes a good 2 hours to wander through all the many and different buildings, areas, gardens and sights. There is also a theatre were we caught the last few minutes of a very colourful musical show. Because the citadel housed the whole of the Royal household it is very extensive. Huge work has been undertaken in restoration and modern reinterpretations of the old buildings. It is well worth walking all the way to the back to see where the gardens and lake, with the floating flowers have been restored. All in all a really good place to visit"
"We were visit the Citadel during few days in Hue .
Good place to visit and learning about Vietnamese history and culture"
"Big acient Imperial city that is a must see when in Hue, however it was quite boring. Most of the buildings were destroyed by US and Vietcong bombs dureing the war"
You can spend a lovely afternoon wondering around the purple forbidden city. Much of this has been distroyed through wars over the years but is starting to be rebuilt. Don't miss the impressive video and pictures to give you a flavour of this city in its former glory.
"This really takes you back into the time when it would have been in it's prime, and also takes you to the more recent history of it's wrecking during the most war. The sheer size of the whole place is incredible and really makes you appreciate the power of the rulers of the past."
"What a great shame that so much was destroyed during the American War. Now a programme of restoration is underway. The place is huge. So it will take many years yet to complete the programme.
What has been restored is impressive. You need to spend time here not only to cover the ground but also to get a sense of and appreciate its former glory.
The lifestyle of The Emporer must have been magnificent."
The enormous flag at the enterance to the citadel is an iconic photo opportunity. The whole citadel complex is enormous and you need an umbrella to walk around in the tropical downpour. Allow at least 90 minutes to walk if you hope to see the Forbidden city as well. Well preseved good displays
As other reviewers have noted this was clearly an impressive place prior to its destruction. The renovated portions give some idea of its former splendor. We spent a pleasant time strolling around the grounds.
"We traveled on a motorbike tour to The Citadel and spent a good two hours here. It is well worth watching the video at the of the city as it explains the reconstruction that has taken place or soon will.

The areas of The Citadel that have been reconstructed are spectacular! The paintwork and detail of the buildings is great inspiration for any aspiring architect or designer. Each building served a purpose in the Citadel so we recommend having a map on hand to learn about the history of the buildings and locate where you are!

There was a shop in the city for a well needed ice cream (it was extremely hot!) although prices are slightly higher here, so try wait it out until you're outside The Citadel.

Due to the vast area of the Imperial City, select the buildings you choose to see wisely as it is a physically demanding place to explore if you plan on walking! We did see a little bus tour going round as we were on our way out so look into that if you aren't into walking.

Aim for a mix of seeing the reconstructed and old parts of the city, but we highly recommend the reconstructed parts as they have been done so well! The ancient parts of the Citadel show evidence of the war so they are well worth the look as well.

We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Citadel, just prepare yourself with lots of water, comfortable shoes, and snacks!"
Walk around it's a very special place To go. Off course you 're not Alone but the complex is hughe so you really can find very quit spots when you walk a bit outside from the main buildings and you can imagine How life was during the Emperor's periods
This is a very impressive place and although in disrepair in some areas you can imagine life here many many years ago. Loved hearing about the history of this once Imperial City.
"I went to Hue to better understand the 1968 Tet Offensive. Hue City and the Citadel were key battlegrounds in that offensive, and I had no idea what to expect with the Citadel. Seeing the buildings inside the Citadel gave me a completely different perspective on the historical events, including how hard it must have been to fight a battle within the confines of that beautiful structure. To me, the Citadel is a MUST see if you are anywhere in the vicinity of Hue City, whether you are interested in the Vietnam War or just want to better understand Vietnamese culture and history. Similar to the Forbidden City in China, this is a world cultural site that must be preserved."
THe Hue Imperial City must have been impressive before it was nearly completely destroyed during the war. The intricate work on the gateways between each section were amazing and the reconstruction has been tastefully completed. Well worth spending at least 3-4 hours here.
They are renovating (jul 14) the main entrance gate. The rest of the citadel is very nice and welcoming for tourists. We walked +- 3 hours in the citadel before leaving to find a cooler place. be aware that there are 2 entrances the right one is for Vietnamese (55k dong) and the left one is for Western tourists (105 k dong). But dont let the price influence you for not going in. Its worth your time.
Unfortunately a big part of the Citadel was destroyed during the war. Expected more for an UNESCO world heritage site.
"would be better to see once more renovations have occurred but was also very hot and huge area to explore without much shade, better to go very early or late in day"
"take a tour guide so you get all the questions answered that you walk around thinking about, because this place has an aura about it. very intriguing"
"This imperial city surrounded by a moat with water from the Purple river enclosed was the ""Purple forbidden city "" was compared to the Forbidden City In Beijing must have been so grand in the earlier times, . got destroyed during the Vietnam Tet war in 1968 inspite of resrictions of not to bomb. The whole place is being restored, hopefully close to original structure, amazing part was the Royal Theatre, A must visit to feel and experience what the must past have been."
"The citadel itself is lovely but we got scammed at the ticket desk... we gave the girl a 500,000 vnd bill and she swapped it for a 100,000 bill quicker than lightening then demanded more money... and lets be honest i couldnt start arguing with her with another 2 vietnamese men standing along side her... a bit intimidating!!! So just be weary of your money... try have exact money its 105,000 vnd entry in"
"This is the primary historical attraction in Hue. It appears that a lot of restoration work is underway based on a lot of roped off areas, and the high entrance fee of 105000 VND per person (high relative to other sights in Vietnam).

It's a massive complex with many parts to explore. You can use some maps and signs with descriptions to understand the layout and purpose of different areas, but it quickly becomes repetitive. Also, the oppressive July heat didn't encourage us to spend a lot of time walking around outdoors. Perhaps a guided tour would make it more interesting.

I would suggest that this sight can be skipped if you're on the fence about going, or if you've seen some other temples and sights in Vietnam already."
"Enjoyed making my way through the different palaces (built by different emperors) in the Citadel compound. Really aided by the photo histories posted in the hallways which English translations -- a great help. Wish I'd visited in a cooler time (rather than June), as the heat made us rush a bit."
"I found this a sad place, because of the sheer destruction of what must have been a magnificent site in it's prime. I was surprised at how little remains.
There is some restoration going on, with very impressive craftsmanship.
I enjoyed going, and got some really beautiful photos of the ruins. July in Hue is so hot and humid that the children really didn't enjoy things very much, I suspect the ice-cream we bought was the highlight for them.
We did not have a guide, but did have a guidebook which helped get a sense of the place. A guide would have been useful to understand more."
"Having been the focus of a number of major battles, unfortunately not much remains of what once was a spectacular space. A citadel within a citadel within a citadel, the scale of the place is awesome, but difficult to understand from the ruins. There are some surviving structures, and some rebuilding but it is difficult to comprehend. You need a good guide to make sense of the place."
"The imperial city was impressive at first but it the tour seemed very repetitive as everything looked similar within the city walls, although the history behind it is very interesting. It was also ridiculously hot and difficult to concentrate on your surroundings and appreciate it."
While there isn't many buildings left standing within the city due to the war the buildings that are left standing and are being restored are beautiful and breath taking. Walking around the area you can see where the buildings would have stood and how the palace would have looked. I would highly recommend a guide as there are very few signs and the information that was given by my guide was extremely helpful in imagining the palace as it once was.
"A must-see in Hue. Huge complex of temples, tombs and courtyards with lots of restoration still going on. See how the country's royalty lived. The importance of religion and its influence on their culture. Beautiful and intricate colorful carvings all around you, on building walls and roofs. There are displays and exhibits of old pictures showing the royal residents and events that were celebrated within its walls. You could easily spend 1.5 hrs here at a minimum, wandering the halls and the grounds. Go visit with a guide to fully appreciate and understand the rich past of this beautiful walled city."
"As many of the other review highlight, there is still much restoration work to be done. But with a knowledgable guide it is possible to imagine the majesty of the city. The sheer scale and number of buildings, including the ruins is very impressive. The are many picture boards with additional information also. The guide will explain the hierarchy of the mandarin, how religion influenced the royal family and the Feng Shui design.
There is not much shade so an umbrella is recommended. A small gift shop near the centre of the palace sells cold drinks.
Must be followed by a trip to the tomb of the second last King, some 20 to 30 minutes drive but truly impressive also."
"The former seat of the emperor is gradually rebuilt after it was destroyed in the Vietnam War. The parts that have been rebuilt are already worth visiting. Even the entrance fee is over 100k dong I was glad I paid it after the visit. If they continue doing such a great work in rebuilding this place is going to be similarly impressive as the forbidden city in Beijing when they are done.
There was a photo exposition when we were there. It made the whole experience even more worthwhile because the pictures showed scenes, when the city was still inhabited by emperors. In addition there were additional historical information - very interesting. They should make that information stay there permanently and add some more."
"The old imperial palace is worth a visit and spend some hours walking around. Lots of restoration is on going on various objects and buildings. Hopefully in the future it will be an amazing place. The entrance fee is 105000 Vnd, not much I think. A guided tour would have given me more, rather than reading in guide books."
"In overall, there's nothing much to see inside the imperial city. Most building collapsed, rotting and refurbishment is ongoing. I believe the best view is the gate that can view from outside but is now under construction.
Ticket comes in 2 standard, local and foreign.. Foreigner gotta pay almost double, disappointed!
Not much thing to see after the hall. I don't feel impressive at all. Don't really worth to pay for the price."
"Honestly, there's nothing much to see of the Forbidden City at this time since its under reconstruction. But still worth visiting inside. The Imperial City, the outer part of Forbidden City is OK. There are quaint cafes outside the walls, perfect for a quiet coffee time or dinner."
"The city is actually quite large, it was a good half days event walking around, looking at all the old buildings built with a very obvious Chinese influence and reading about the history behind it."
"Restoration in progress, many parts of the city is in ruins

PLEASE TAKE NOTE: The lady at the entrance tried scam my money while buying the entrance ticket. I give 510,000VND for the 105,000 ticket. She switch my 500,000 vnd to 100,000 vnd and return me the change of 5000vnd. I was initially confused as she was holding 110,000 instead of 510,000. I check my wallet balance and challenged her, then she return my 400,000vnd.
Please try give exact to be safe."
"I was very surprised since at first I thought it was going to be full of tourists and tours and you wouldn't crasp the feel of the place but it is a huge place and after passing the main entrance and palace, there are many other buildings to see and walking through the place you can easily imagine how it was. It is very well documented to with black & white potos. I stayed about 3 hours and it was very well worth a stop."
"You could easily spend half a day here. Tree lined streets help in the heat. Restorations are being done tastefully. USA trashed a lot of this in the war, using it as a base. Loved the mother's palace and the library. UNESCO"
"This Imperial city has a lot to see and is quite large. Hiring a local guide will help you understand some of what happened here. Make sure you give yourself ample time to see it, or see the highlights. During the summer it can get pretty hot so have water."
"This was a vast compound, worthy of a full day's visit. When we went it was very hot though and was exhausting. The site is impressive, but needs some renovation, or at the very least a good clean."
"I did not have high expectations due to the destruction caused during the war however, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit. The site is vast with lots of different things to see. The buildings that have been restored were fantastic and more restoration work is underway. I loved the displays of the royal family’s traditional costumes and the theatre was stunning. When I left I decided to take a cyclo back to my hotel. Initially I wanted to go straight to my hotel but I got talked into doing a short tour. I lucked out, as the cyclo driver I had was a lovely man, who spoke a little English, and took me to see things that I never would have seen otherwise. It was very enjoyable."
The citadel was amazing- to see the city centre and what still remains from so many years ago! I was in awe. Get a guided tour though so you know what you are looking at
"We had a private tour organised by Indochina Tours which was amazing. Had no idea this Citadel was so grand and the royal family was here in such recent times. Our guide Anh gave us a rich appreciation and understanding of the history - without this tour we wouldn't have made as much out of our time with 2 young kids or as much fun. I would definitely recommend a tour if you are going to see the Citadel. Ours also included a lunch at Banana Mango restaurant, a dragon boat ride down the Perfume River & touring of the Tombs - it was a very full day!"
"Our hotel was on the other side of the river from here, worth the walk, I would allow 2 hours minimum to get round more if you want to see everything and if you want to read all the info. (which is also in English) then 3 hours. There are 2 cafés in this vast site, one not far from the entrance and one on the far left corner (the more attractive of the two) it has suffered damage from the war but there is still plenty to see and some of it is spectacular, wood carving in particular. It really is on a grand scale and worth your time. You enter this vast site from the front facing the river but exit from the back or the right hand site remember this when heading out as it took us 10 to 15 mins to walk to the exit due to the way we explored it. Would suggest a clockwise route but somehow you have to go down the middle as well!"
"Big impressive complex, especially the main royal chamber. I recommend to pick a day when it's not raining"
"I was somewhat ambivalent about visiting after reading here and elsewhere the degree that the Citadel and inner Imperial palaces were destroyed during the war. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that there is plenty to look at, and plenty more in various stages of restoration. Based on what they have already restored the quality of the restoration is and will be excellent. In a few years this wonderful site will be spectacular. The displays are pretty well captioned, including English, so it is not hard to determine what you are looking at. I doubt a guide is required for most people. Well worth spending a morning wandering this vast site."
"Much destroyed by war, the Citadel is still quite impressive. And it is really the Imperial Enclosure within the Citadel that you will want to see. The area within the walls of the Citadel is huge (and not really interesting) and the area within the Imperial Enclosure is quite large as well. First of all, do not see the Citadel as part of a tour that also includes seeing the Imperial tombs. You will not have enough time to do it justice. And you will arrive tired after the first part of your tour. See it on its own. There are many buildings that deserve to be seen in the Imperial Enclosure - with large empty spaces in-between of buildings destroyed by war. Take the time to see it slowly. It should take about a half day - three to three and a half hours."
"The Imperial City was very interesting as to the way it was built. The ancient history, the decor and architecture was quite impressive, enlightening, and very charming with the displays of traditional costumes of the Emperor and his family, etc. It certainly is worthwhile visiting this site. Discovering the history through video presentations was very helpful."
"It's a beautiful place to walk around tough a bit cold when it rains, but still worth it. Try to pick a sunny day!"
"First the bad bits: The pricing for going to the Citadel was confusing and the signage and instructions were very few and inadequate. There were no food stalls or anything to eat, except a very limited kiosk with bags of crisps and few chocolates. Perhaps that was just the time of year.
Positives: It's an extraordinary place,unusual, choc-a-block of history and stories, vast grounds with lots to see (take 2-3 hours at least, so take refreshments!) It can do with a bit of restoration and TLC, but well worth a visit. Do visit the emperial hall and the museum (across the road- badly signposted!) is also worth a peek."
"A smaller version of the forbidden city ,but still shows the might and power of the ancient kings .
The damage caused by bombing is still clearly visible in parts and there is a lot of restorations being done ,its really a fortress within a fortress within another fortress with a center that is still occupied and lived in .
my first visit was during the New years celebration rehearsals and i was treated to fabulous dancing and music."
I went to the Citadel after visiting all the emperor's tomb and it's a really neat place to walk around. It's very cool that people live and work within the first set of walls. The inner part feels like an non-renovated and smaller version of Beijing's forbidden city. The saddest part is that so much of it was destroyed or is falling apart from the war. It's not hard to imagine what it would've felt like in its heyday. It's still worth a visit if you go to Hue.
Defintly a must see in Hue. The dragon flys were everywhere when we were there. Once the restorations are complete it will be nicer. My parents did the Queen and King photos...hilarious!
"It was pretty hot when walking around but very interesting. Much has been rebuilt since war. Shows old court and all its decadence.
Worth a visit."
"What you are seeing in this picture is currently under cover being restored.as is a large chunk of the property. It's a hot walk in for very little
One can imagine what it must have been with the help of a digital video on arrival but there is little to see now. Perhaps in a couple of years when restoration work is completed."
"It is worth seing, but you wont see much! Most of it was destroyed and a good chunk if it is being restored!

This is supposed to be the main thing to see un hue, so if you dont have more than a month to spend in vietnam, i would Skip hue!"
Beautiful grounds and numerous ancient structures. At 9 am each day there is a changing of the colorful guard. Make sure to get a guide so as to learn all about the citadel.
"Access to the hotel Cyclo drives. Vast city with beautiful gardens.
a lot of walking and stairs.
little furniture. Beautiful statues and bells.
To do early in the morning because the heat is intense in April.
Visited April, 2014"
"When ever you go, this place is wonderful from the preserved citadel wall to the informative rooms depicting how life was before heavy bimbo get left many of the inner city destroyed. A fascinating walk round imperial Vietnam.

I recommend buying a three sites ticket which also gains you access to two royal tombs outside the city."
"Not too much to do in Hue, but visiting the old imperial city has to on your list. We did a cyclo tour (make sure you arrange a fee before you get in) and it was a great way to see the citadel and the surrounding buildings"
The setting is lovely and idyllix - the perfect antidote to a week in Hanoi. Hue was bombed to crap in the American war and the restorations haven't progressed terribly far. Still what's there is lovely and well worth the trip.
"Worth spending a couple of hours here exploring the site, a lot of the original buildings have been destroyed but with a knowledgeable guide you get a good idea of the history and traditions of the past."
"There really isn't a lot here. However, if you get the combo ticket to Ming Mang, and Khan Dinh, it makes this just 20,000 to enter. I would not pay full price to just go in here. We spent about 2 hours."
"Entry price is 105,000VND. Especially liked to be able to photos of the kings, queens, eunuchs and mandarins in the right mandarin room. Pity much was destroyed in wars."
"A wonderful day spent here (although it was oppressively hot!) wandering round the grounds and buildings. We took a guided tour from our hotel in Hoi An and our guide was an amazingly knowledgable and passionate historian. If you are in the area this is a must do - make sure you set aside plenty of time for the nearby Pagoda, the palace and the mausoleum. Its a great day out."
"DefinTely the top attraction in Hue. Charmingly undeveloped, and being rapidly reconstructed after destruction in the American war. You are able to wander over a very large area, but the are not many facilities so take plenty of water and sunscreen. There are a good number of signs in English, but very little information in depth, so either read up before you go or find a guide (although there did not seem to be any about when we were there).
There is quite a long way to walk as this is such a vast site, so plan at least 2 hours for a visit.
We found the displays and buildings very evocative of the Imperial and the Colonial era which when combined with the absolute destruction of modern warfare makes this a fascinating and poignant place."
If you want to get a fantastic panoramic view of Hue then make your way to the Imperial Hotel and take the lift up to the 16th floor where there is a bar with the best views of the city order a pot of green tea for 2 and it will cost you less than £3 the views are well worth it
"Entry for my husband and I cost VND 210,000. Cyclo from our hotel (Holiday Diamond Hotel) cost us VND 50,000.

If you've been to Jogjakarta, Indonesia, then Hue and the Imperial City might remind you a bit of it. It's a low-built building in a wide complex and even before entering the gate you can feel the ancient-ness and imperial-ness of it.

There are scattered English captions here and there but you will have a better experience with a tour guide. We didn't get one and when we realized we probably should have gotten one we were already half way through so I eavesdropped here and there when were within earshot of an English tourist guide.

Slow and proper view of everything would probably take you 2 to 3 hours but we were pretty tired that day so we were less than 2 hours there."
"The Imperial City was the cultural highlight of our trip to Vietnam and we are so glad we made the effort as the Hue Airport was being rebuilt when we visited. The whole old city and palace is most impressive and it is wonderful seeing it being restored. You need to set aside a whole day to do justice to the palace and surrounding city. However, beware of the cyclo operators near the entrance, who are very pushy."
"Well worth braving the heat to see this massive walled city with its decayed buildings and surprising amount of English text. Unlike a lot of Vietnamese historic attractions the citadel does have adequate information though could do with some more to truly allow people to immerse themselves in the past glories of the polygamist King. Make sure you bring plenty of water and food into the complex as the prices are extortionate relative to what you could pay in Hue city. The frozen yoghurt sold in plastic bags with a straw just outside the inner city are very tasty, very effective at cooling you down and are a bargain at about 1/5th the price of an ice cream inside."
"Should visit with locals or guide to help you know many interesting historical stories in the Citadel. Some places in the Citadel were damaged by war, but they are still worth visiting !"
"I really enjoyed visiting the Imperial City. It was a drizzly day, there weren't many people about, and it was just so nice to wander the gardens alone and get away from the hecticness of Vietnam for an hour or two. For this reason, I'd recommend against getting a tour. I'd rather wander at my own pace, and find my own interesting bits."
"Make sure you get a guided tour of the citadell to get the full experience, otherwise you will miss out as there are few signs."
"This is a fantastic site. History is incredible.
Walk or cyclo from town.
cyclo for us, it was b hot.
spend half day here wandering around, get off the beaten track and discover stuff. We found a theatre with a small orchestra in practise session, brilliant, what makes your experience. cannot recommend this site highly enough."
"Not much to see just a lot of temples, a lot of them reconstructed. A couple of nice photo spots but you can find similar places around the city."
"There is not much left of the imperial city due to the War. Alot is being done to restore. It is worth the trip to Visit and see the old imperial Vietnam. I made a blog of this journey. I hope this gives you guys a good idea.
http://www.lesocietefair.com/2014/06/chronicles-of-indochina-6-perfume-of-an-nam/"
"What a place, a great place to visit, quite incredible. A big thank you to the authorities and the UN for restoring this place, it is indeed a world heritage site."
"Although I didn't like the city of Hue much, we loved the Imperial City and it is definitely a place you should visit for either a morning or afternoon. It is a lovely place to stroll around looking at all the buildings that they have restored. There is also a small museum that gives you information about the emperors which I found very interesting.

This is a definite must if you are visiting Hue."
"I was a young 20 year old, during the war. I was up North as they say in I Corp. The Citadel/Imperial City has a rich history that goes back centuries. This was the summer vacation spot for the then rulers old Viet-Nam. Some of the most fierce fighting of the war took place here during early 1968. Most of the interior sites were destoryed during the war. Some were rebuilt, but the restoration lacks original detail.You can spend hours wondering around at your own pace or get a tour guide that has the knowledge, and speaks the language you need. That will be most helpful to your party. It appears the restoration is a work in progress that has a way to go.I was in country from Apr66-Dec69, thus this late entry......"
"Nice flat location to wonder at own leisure. Lots of interesting things to look at some old some being renovated. There were places to get a snack, juice or ice cream while leisurely walking around, allow a good 3-4 hours. At times the sun can be piercing hot take some shade with you as these areas can get busy."
"Very impressive,colourful and soooo big ! Allow a minimum of 2 hours to see it properly.Easy 10 minute tuc tuc ride from the city centre."
"We were staying in Danang, and felt that we should visit Hue as a day trip, particularly The Citadel. We organised a car with driver and a guide from Hoi An. This turned out to be a sad mistake. Although the drive from Danang to Hue and back was very beautiful, our guide was little more than useless. No input (about anything Vietnamese) on the way there and back. At the Citadel itself, he gave us only the scantiest of information. What a shame! The Citadel is a huge site, with many beautiful things to admire. Many are sadly not the originals, but it is thrilling to see that restoration is being undertaken very seriously. Language is still a challenge, and if your guide doesn't speak your language, much of the meaning and background to The Citadel is lost. There are very few descriptions/explanations for foreign visitors. Although it was stiflingly hot when we were there, it is super to wander around and enjoy the tranquility and the beauty of those buildings that have not been destroyed/damaged and those that have been restored."
"Take the time to wander over this amazing historical site. I recommend going with a guide who can give you all the very interesting background about the past kings.
There are many planned restorations, which will make it an incredible Unesco site to visit in the future.
Beautiful gardens to wander through on a hot Hue summer's day."
"This is an impressive site, covers quite a bit of land. We went with no guide, next time would opt for one. You can imagine how grand it all was. There is a lot of rennovation going on but it just makes you want to come back when complete. It is currently very hot so take lots of water, cap and look for shade. There is enough to see for a couple of hours as the details are interesting. They have photos on display of perhaps last dynasty, no dates. Good place to visit. Took a 3 year old and 7 year old and they enjoyed it, but the heat... the cauldrons, enormous have very hot water in them, all courtesy of the sun"
"A definite visit when touring Hue. Whilst one can make some comparison with the Forbidden City in Beijing this is on a smaller scale and some of the buildings with different functionality.

Much remains unrestored, however it is still impressive.

And is you love Bonsai you must visit the Imperial Garden"
"Definitely worth visiting. It will take you about 2 hrs to explore but there are many open areas, parks and picturesque views."
loved walking around the Imperial city and getting a touch of what it would have been like through the centuries.
"Really interesting place to visit, hundreds of years of history giving you a great insight into the Chinese rulership of Vietnam. Lots of ongoing renovation which will make it even more interesting in the future."
"A lot of the citadel interior has been replaced/repainted so its a ll a bit ""shinny"" in places, but as the place was damaged during the war no surprise there. Intersting series of old photos on display, no dates though on them."
"It covers a huge area, with the bombed buildings slowly being rebuilt. You can get a good idea of the scale of the place when it was in its prime. Some lovely avenues and generally a relaxing place to visit."
"Much has been said about Hue's Imperial City on TA and many believe it not worth visiting, but to be honest you will miss out if you don't go. This place is the former historical capitol of Vietnam and the Citadel is a walled and moat surrounded complex which offers much more than just a bombed out old site. Indeed the impressive walls and access gates ( there are ten ) lead you to an ancient time. Yes there are large portions of this place which have been devastated by war but the Vietnamese are doing their utmost to restore this back to its former glory. And from the sections they have restored then this will be a marvellous wonder when they are finished. However, there is plenty to see now and it is relatively inexpensive to get in. We went early afternoon and it wasn't as hot as I was expecting, possibly we got a lucky day. We spent two hours wandering around and seeing the various elements, which could be improved with a few more informative signs or stations, but it is the variety and style that is so impressive. From large cannons to the impressive walls, courtyard areas and traditional style buildings, large impressive gardens and water storage areas and pools. The combination is great and will be so much better in years to come. My wife and here sister even had the opportunity of dressing like the former Emperors and sit on the throne which was a colourful sight to see. All in all I loved it here and even without the further information this requires, you can lose yourself in days gone by and immerse yourself in ancient Vietnam and the Nguyen dynasty. Don't miss it."
"The Citadell is rather impressive and definetely one of the most interesting attractions in Hue. It tooks us about one hour to walk around it (including reading signs explaining the history etc).
As with a lot of historical places in developing countries, the whole place is completely wide open, with no preservation of different sites. On the one hand this means you can get up close and climb around on the old crumbled parts of the Citadell, on the other hand it probably won't be this ""authentic"" for very much longer. Defintely go if you have the time!"
"This is a huge site, with lots of amazing and beautiful things to see. we walked miles I'm sure! There are many buildings that have been rebuilt in the original style amongst the still beautiful partly ruined original buildings. Its lovely just to wander where you want to go as we did. There are guides and tours who will tell you all, but there are guide books/site maps available. It was very hot walking around, a sunshade or hats are a necessity. Drinks and ice creams are available within the walls, but no doubt cheaper outside."
"Before Vietnam War, travelers described the citadel of Hue to be among the most beautiful places Asia has to offer. Someone even wrote that Hue’s Forbidden City used to be more beautiful and sophisticated than its famous counterpart in Beijing.
While I was aware that the citadel was heavily destroyed during Vietnam War, I could not imagine the extent of destruction. At least, I hoped that the remaining and rebuilt buildings were in a better shape and that authorities try hard to revitalize their country’s biggest cultural treasure. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in my expectations.
While the fortification walls including the gates are huge and amazing, most other buildings of the former palace look depressing. I am not sure if the reason for that is the financial background or communist politics which have always tried hard to destroy all traces of the former rulers. Anyway, there is not much left of the Forbidden City of Hue apart from some single buildings. Furthermore, the whole area is not really cultivated and maintained: unlike other historical buidlings, there are nearly no descriptions about the history and architectural features of the place, so a very detailed guidebook is necessary. There is no tourist infrastructure i.e. a nice café, a small shop selling guide books or even benches to sit down. Also the surroundings are strange, the citadel borders a tennis court to the north.
I planned to dedicate a whole afternoon to explore the place but left it after a 1.5 hours with much disappointment.
Those who are interested in Vietnamese culture and history are advised to take a boat trip to some other sights in Hue’s surroundings as the royal tombs or Thien Mu pagoda. All these places are relatively well presevered. I deeply hope that authorities will invest some money in the future to rebuilt this important and historical place. Otherwise, I wouldn’t bother to visit again if returning to Hue."
"one could only imagine how grand it might have been in its hey days when you step into the palace. Dispite severe distructions caused by wars and natural disasters, there are evidences all around the palace that efforts are being made to bring the palace to former glory. I order to appreciate thr palace, it would be good idea to spend at least a couple of hour or more soaking up the atmosphere. Definitely a must see attraction when in Hue..."
This place is amazing and spread out over a very large area. Unfortunately when we were there it was 40 degrees so was very very hot walking around however I would still recommend this as a worthwhile attraction just because of the history it represents etc.
Loved the architecture and layout of the place. The reconstruction works are little by little bringing the citadel back to life.
"The buildings here are kept pretty well and there is an interesting exhibit here funded by the Germans that explains a lot more about the emperors in Vietnam. Beautiful old buildings and nice gardens. Would be good to provide a detailed map to visitors. It gets very hot and there is little to no cover in some parts of the grounds so bring an umbrella, lots of water and sun cream."
"Recommend a group tour with a tour guide to walk you through and tell you what's what. Tickets are 100,000 Dong each (roughly £3)"
This is a large area and if the weather is hot and humid (which it often is in Hue) I'd recommend making use of the various forms of transport available. The electric cars you can hire by the morning and they'll drop you off and pick you up at most of the sites within the Forbidden City but to get the most out of the old city hire a cyclo-rickshaw and sit back. Negotiate your fee for the hour before setting off though.
"It's real experience to walk to the temples and gardens - visit also the left and right wings, not only the middle."
"Take one of the riksha's and enjoy the view to the perfume river, see markets, small streets and pagodas! If you want to visit the imperial city you can ask the driver to wait for you at the gate where you will finish your visit but fix the price for the complete ride in advance. This is a great way to explore old Hué."
"Visiting the Imperial City was well worth the money ($5). It's very beautiful and peaceful - there really weren't many tourists when I was there. It's also in the city centre so very close to go and visit, unlike the tombs which are all quite far away. If you have one day, definitely go to the Citadel and take a few hours for it. Late afternoon is really nice as it's cooler and the evening light is great for photos. Just remember that it closes at 5.30pm (I got there at 3.40pm and felt a little rushed - although it's not such a big place there is lots to see)."
I really enjoyed my visit to the Citadel. As it was low season there were very few people. It was extremely hot and so we made use of the electric car. Our guide Nhi was so lovely - I would highly recommend having a guide to tell you all the legends and little bits that you wouldn't normally hear.
This is a historical sturture that is a pleasure to walk around and enjoy the sights. The place was bombed during the vietnam war but the cultural presences is seen everywhere. We were told that the lay out of the place had to do with the kings desires.
"I first visited The Citadel or Hue's Imperial City during Hue Festival 2008 and since then, I became a regular visitor every year. The Citadel used to be the home of the Nguyen emperors. You need to spend more time to explore this massive area. They rent out some costumes for a small fee so you can dress up like an emperor and have your photos taken. This surely adds fun and excitement to your trip."
"Go here and spend about an hour or two just to walk around and feel like a king back from the olden days. it is a very large attraction; however, much of it is still intact. see if you can get someone to explain the significance of some of the places. The gardersn were my favorite part as you could pick the fruit and eat it (if you are sneaky)!"
"If you visit anything in hue IT MUST BE THIS.
Take plenty of water as you will be here for at least 5 hours.
There is so much to see and do AMAZING SIGHTS
A GREAT DAY OUT"
"No fee to just wander into the old city, over one of the many small bridges and through one of the stunning old archways. Reminded me of the old city walls in Xi'an, China but a little older and not so polluted, if anyone has been there."
"Great historical site, and well worth a visit if you are in Hue. We found it really interesting, especially to see before we visited some of the tombs, to get a sense for how the royal family lived. It's a huge, sprawling site, with beautifully restored buildings.

We were actually in Hue when a festival was on, and we were able to go at night, they had a whole lot of performances on, and it was great to see it by night. I would have liked to return during the day to have a look around, but we didn't have enough time in Hue."
"The two restaurants in the citadel suggested by lonely planet have some of the worst reviews I have ever seen on TripAdvisor (and are worth a read for comedy value). Locals are not much more helpful, suggesting there are no restaurants available. Perhaps there are some, but we couldn't find any, which was a little disappointing. We ended up buying some very tasty pastries at a bakery which saved our stomachs.

The citadel is quite irritating to navigate due to all the one way systems, but once you make it into the forbidden purple city, it's worth it."
"You can walk and read about that era of history with pictures of that time with some modern restoration. It was bombed extensively during the American war, but being restored."
The history and cultural significance for central Vietnam cannot be understated but visually as a tourist destination and spectacle this vast overgrown walled city is nothing like the grandeur and quality of the Forbidden City in Beijing China. It's worth a visit and certainly deserves to be in the top 10 but don't lose any sleep if you miss out on this part if the itinerary.
"New renovation work means that parts of the citadel are less than beautiful to see, however, this is a long term project that seeks to restore the majesty of the buildings. The parts of the citadel that have been restored have been completed to a high standard and include New information boards in French, English and Vietnamese so you can be more informed about the royal history of Vietnam."
"I had not read much about the old Imperial City, and I think that was a good thing -- I would have been disappointed to see it has been so badly damaged. Still, it is quite an impressive place to visit, with beautiful gates and walls, and an impressive general layout. I'd like to go back in 10 years, see how much of it will be restored. As it stands now, damaged from all the warfare, it is a poignant reminder of what outside invaders have done over the decades to Vietnam -- and maybe that reminder, especially to foreigners, is more important than seeing it restored in some artificial way.
One additional note: the closing time is relatively early, and the grounds take a good few hours to see, so don't wait too late in the afternoon to visit."
"This is well worth a visit, but there are some large expanses of open courtyard that can get very hot, so take something to protect yourself from the sun. I loved the long corridors of red lacquered wood. Was also lucky enough to stumble across some musicians in costume, playing traditional instruments. There isn't an awful lot of signage in English, so a guide might be advisable. I opted for a quick hour-long scout round before the heat got too much for me."
"Hue is the only one city that has the whole monument of the Royal, most of them are not destroy. People are friendly and the fresh air.
I'd like tha ancient palaces most.. It's so interested"
"It was a boiling hot day so we probably didn't give this the time it deserved but it was a lovely peaceful place to walk around and had a nice calm about it. Having been to the Forbidden City in Beijing this was not as awesome but it is definitely worth a visit. Its cheap to go in, a good few hours to walk around properly and interesting especially if you watch the small video as you go inside so it makes more sense."
"Honestly out of all of Vietnam this place was my favorite. The heritage and scope of this place is amazing.

Top points:
Get a guide if u can as there is lots to see and understand
Get the combination ticket which includes the two best tombs
Plan to be there for at least 2hrs"
"The Citadel in Hue is incredibly reminiscent of the Forbidden City in Beijing. Over-the-top opulence; massive scale; red buildings dominating a prize location.
It is not on the same scale of course, but the similarities are many.
Particularly affecting, were the places where the battles of the Tet offensive remain visible. It is a salutary reminder of a terrible time which included the destruction of a large section of the royal buildings ...
The Citadel is undoubtedly the highlight of any visit to Hue and is of course an essential experience."
"Hue Citadel is situated on the “Great Island”, in the range generated by the flow of the Perfume river in front and two tributaries include Bach Yen (silver swallow, gold dragon) Kim Long) at theback flowing round and meet together again downstream. Perfume River is the main road, along with two small islands Con Hen and Da Vien with position of “Ta Thanh Long , Huu Bach Ho” (left green dragon, right white tiger-two guards with great power) heading to the front of the Citadel. Across the river, not far away is Ngu Binh mount top, shielding the front Citadel from bad spirits.
The Citadel and all the structures of Royal Palace, Forbidden City are turning to the south, in the direction referring to “Thanh nhan nam dien nhi thinh thien ha"" (king facing South to rule the country).
Based on the principles of feng shui, the Nguyen emperors has combined the elements available in natural terrain such as rivers, mountains, islands ... with the sensible intervention of human hands when filling some sections of the river Bach Yen, Kim Long, and dug a series of river systems and trenches inside and outside the Imperial City to serve his ideas. All such efforts are not out of desire for long-term capital of Nguyen Dynasty. It is hard to recognize any purposeful arrangement in a harmonious overall architecture of nature-like."
"This site is going through alot of reconstruction - it was bombed heavily so they are redoing areas but this does not take away from the site since it is a large area.
Many areas to go through - and some have shops and art galleries (we bought a rice paper water color).
Wonderful variety - palaces, religious buildings, theater, library etc. Great to wander around and imagine living in this walled city many many years ago."
"The Citadel is a vast walled fortress housing a palace and other interesting architectural sites making it a worth while place to visit when in Hue. Most average travelers like my wife and I needed just two hours to view the site. I would suggest to those that plan a visit to get there early for several reasons…one being to beat the heat of mid day, the other is to be present during two cultural events that we truly enjoyed. One being a traditional music event at 8:15am which is also repeated at 2pm and the other is the changing of the guards that takes place at 9:am.

To those of you that will be visiting the Royal Tombs I would advise to purchase a combination ticket here which will be good for two days and will allow entrance in two Royal Tombs…Khai Dinh Tomb and Minh Mang Tomb…it will save you a little bit of money.

You need to ask for this combination ticket when at the Citadel as it is not promoted at all.

I"
"We spent a good few hours walking around the old citadel and it could have been longer. Really enjoyable trip and amazing to see the ruins and the preserved rooms. The video in the south east block shows a graphic reconstruction of how it looked, and it would have been immense in its pomp. One of the highlights of Vietnam, a real must see."
We spend 3/4 day walking around her and thoroughly enjoyed it. Quite hot so make sure you bring water
"The Imperial City (Vietnamese: Kinh thành Huế) in Huế is a walled fortress and palace in the former capital of Vietnam.
The grounds of the Imperial City were surrounded by a wall 2 kilometers by 2 kilometers, and the walls were surrounded by a moat. The water from the moat was taken from the Huong River (Perfume River) that flows through Huế. This structure is called the citadel. Inside the citadel was the Imperial City, with a perimeter of almost 2.5 kilometers. Inside the Imperial City was the imperial enclosure called the Purple Forbidden City in Vietnamese, a term similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing. The enclosure was reserved for the Nguyễn imperial family.
Absolutely breathtaking - some of the architecture is astoundingly beautiful."
Worth a Visit. Great to see the citadel. Much of the citadel is still standing despite the fighting. Worth getting a tour to hear the history.
"It may be one of the most important sites for visit in Hue. But don't compare that with other imperal site like the forbidden city in China, you will be disappointed.

Travel here and make sure that you try to appreciate Vietnam history and culture, pls don't compare that with other culture or else you will be disappointed."
"This is a must see attraction. If this is your thing, you will definitely be in your element. Suffered extensive damage in the Vietnam war and some considerable work has been done since to restore. Some parts have, however been destroyed completely."
"This area is well worth visiting. It has to be remembered that the buildings were very badly damaged in the late 60's and it is extremely expensive & painstaking to undertake restoration. A great job has been done so far to restore the Forbidden City and it is well worth visiting.
We also got a map and bicycles from our hotel and rode around the inside of the citadel walls early in the day. This meant that we were not targeted by the omnipresent cyclo and motorbike touts (but hey, they are just trying to make a living so we can't criticize) and we ran into a number of genuinely friendly local people on our way.

The citadel itself is free to enter, whilst the Forbidden City has a small charge."
"Some say you can 'do' this site in an hour or so, but I can't imagine that is possible. Even though it was a very hot day we took 4 hours and still didn't see everything. There's much to see including a good deal of restoration in progress. We also enjoyed the lesser-visited sections in the north-east part of the site where there were shady places to sit and observe the beautiful flora and ponds."
"Of all the attractions like this I visited in Vietnam this was definitely the worst. Still half under construction, no help from signs or staff about where to go and at one point we seemingly wandered into someones living room! Oh, and the souvenirs, drinks and food inside are very overpriced for what they are."
"I think a lot of it was lost on us, as we didn't hire a guide and there aren't many explanatory signs. The temples and gates were really beautiful and the massiveness of the site was impressive, though. We only made it through half of the grounds and that took us about two hours. The entry fee was 105,000 dong but if it goes toward restoration of the site, we're okay with that! There is very little shade so bring a hat or umbrella and plenty of water."
"I was there when they did the preparing for the hue festival. That was probably the most interesting part about that place. If you have seen a lot of other temples in asia, skip this one, as the entry fee of 100k dong is too high, for what you get."
"This is a vast site, some of the areas still under renovation but the site gives you a great experience into what it was like. The imagery for the ongoing renovation work shows that it will be fantastic when completed, at present the site lets you use your own imagination. Give yourself at least an afternoon to visit without being rushed, get a coffee and carry on, hang onto your tickets so you can re enter the same day ,some areas have been flattened by conflicts however the renovated and surviving buildings are spectacular.well worth a visit"
"We walked here from our hotel, the Midtown. It was quite a pleasant walk and we got to stop at shops and markets along the way. Other people hired bikes, which would also have been nice as it was flat. The only downside to the walk was the constant pestering by Cyclo riders (beware of the scams).

The walled citadel is quite a large site and buildings of interest are sparsely dotted within. A lot of the places were closed, and we got escorted out of one place by security, as we accidently gate-crashed some kind of Political meeting between Bulgarian and Vietnamese diplomats/Politians. Whoops. The place was obviously largely flattened during the war and there is a lot of restoration work going on. I didn't really get any great photo's whilst there, which says a lot!

The next day, we hired a moped for $4 for the day, and went past the citadel on the way to the pagoda and tombs. It was a much better way to see the sights. The roads emptied quickly and it was a relaxed way to get around without getting any hassle or being rushed by a guide. The only thing is some people try to charge for parking in free areas, however it is usually only 5 000 dong, so no big deal (and it helps the local economy!!!)."
"I expected it differently. Indeed it's very large and you have to plan 2 hours of visit because of the distance you need to walk between the different doors, houses and temples. I expected it a tad smaller but it's still worth visiting to bring back some amazing pictures."
"and kudos to the historical society who are restoring this monument one building at a time. I do hope they keep a certain part as ruins, just to show the difference.

The centre court is incredible."
Modelled loosely on the Forbidden City in Beijing this is an interesting place to walk around. Easy to find and easy to walk around.
"The Citadel covers a number of individual parts of the palace/s, temples and gates. It has to be seen and appreciated in its entirety rather than the individual parts. The citadel also encloses the old quarter of Hue where a large number of its inhabitants reside. It also encloses a number of excellent restaurants.
Entering the Citadel at the main gate, you encounter the flag tower and the 9 holy cannons. You then enter the royal enclosure which is a fort within the citadel. There is the Thai Hoa Palace with its main reception hall for the emperor. It then has the area for the bureaucrats or mandarins. There is a video running in this area of the palace which puts the whole Citadel into perspective - its architecture and its history.
On some of the walls, there are clearly bullet holes which date to the Vietnam/US War as Hue was one of the areas fought under the infamous Tet Offensive. For a short while, the VietCong held Hue during the conflict. The old demarcation line is only about 150kms north of Hue.
Even in the heat it was interesting to wander around the buildings of the Citadel and it can take almost a day to get around. Take water and rest often in the heat. A rickshaw ride back to the hotel was a pleasant way to return.
A definite must-see when in Hue and take the time to appreciate it."
"We walked across Truong Tien Bridge (see review) to the main entrance gate of Imperial City and strolled around the grounds of this remarkable historic icon of Hue. Bridges over moats surrounding the Palace, the scale of the old ruins being restored is overwhelming.
Have visited The Lost City in Cambodia, now the Imperial City Hue, glad to see restoration taking place, may take a while."
"We only had a short visit as part of a whole day tour. For me in the heat it was enough, but in cooler weather just wander around and enjoy a few hour here."
"Saddened to see alot of disrepair and rubbish, cracking walls unattended around the imperial city. There has been attention paid to the linking corridors and the main theatre but outside of this its hard to see where the admission fee goes. DO NOT buy snack/drinks within the walls, majorly overpriced."
"We really loved the Citadel. Don't miss it if you're in Hue. Great to see restoration work underway. Some bits of restoration are a little odd - such as broken up crockery to recreate murals, but the intricate paint work in places is really well done. The whole place has a great atmosphere too."
"The main reason to visit Hue is the citadel of the old capitol, along with the royal tombs scattered around the countryside. The citadel was begun in 1804 and served as Vietnam's capital until around 1945. The first thing you'll see on approaching it is the big flag tower (Cot Co). The photo above was taken from the Ngo Mon Gate, the main entrance to the citadel. All visitors must enter by this gate, and pay the 105,000 Dong (5 USD) entrance fee."
"A common question tourists ask is whether they should visit Hue or Hoi An if they had limited time in Central Vietnam. Just for this citadel alone, my recommendation would be Hue.

It's huge, authentic and has many many photo opportunities. Culturally, it is immensely rich and gives a good sense of what the dynastic rule was like - probably the only place in Vietnam where this is possible. Highly recommended!"
"It takes several hours to visit this complex of palaces, temples, and gardens. This architectural set up maps out the sort of cultural hierarchy and religious proclivities of the royalty, the Nguyen dynasty of the 19th century, as well as their relations to foreigners and their own subjects! A 150 years of royal capital have had a lasting impact all over the Vietnamese cultural landscape, their dress, food and other practices!"
"Came here as part of a tour, so had a guide to take me around. Nearly all of my group chose to go alone, and as a result I pretty much had a private tour. However, the weather was miserably wet, and my guide was very eager to get out of the rain, so didn't really get as long as I would have liked to walk the grounds. Really needs at least a half day and some dry weather to properly appreciate it.

Many of the buildings have been destroyed, and many more remain damaged from the war, while others are currently being restored (and as such you will find a good chunk of the area is under construction). There is very limited information on site, so invest in a good guide to fully appreciate it."
"The Imperial City is very well preserved and restored example of the great history of Vietnam. You can imagine what went on in the daily life a few hundred years ago right there.

Expect to take a lot of photos and walk around. A guide book is a good thing to bring with you so you know what all the buildings were. Bring water and a hat!

During the Hue Festival there are shows in the evening and night."
"Very interesting visit, we bought the multiple ticket that also includes x2 of the royal tombs. We paid a couple of pound extra for a guide and I would throughly recommend doing it! Not only did we learn a lot about the imperial city, he was able to answer many questions about Vietnam in general. Such a shame so much of the city was lost to French bombing but hopefully they continue with their restoration work. Thoroughly recommend. The gardens were also pretty!"
"we have done a day tour started by the 3 tombs, a buffet lunch and then the citadel. The tombs are more interesting than the citadel, there is an atmosphere in each there is not in the citadel (too much destroyed by war so not much things to see)"
Attended during the bi annual cultural festival. This is an impressive event. Will look to return in 2016
A very cool place. Love the restoration work going on. Enjoyed having our guide telling us more information about this dynasty
"Did this private tour through our Danang hotel. It took about 2 hours to get there. As others have commented, there are damaged walls and buildings completely missing so the model on display gave a sense of the greatness of the complex at its height. You could easily wander around for an hour. Glad I saw it."
"We have been to the Forbidden City in Beijing so could see the similarities. Obviously devastated during the war years, so a mix of decayed and beautifully restored areas. Worth a visit now, but it will be magnificent when fully restored."
In general it's a visit you cannot miss. However it is completely crowded with tourists and many buildings are just destroyed after the war.
"The Citadel is a good spot to walk around, with plenty to see. Unfortunately the Citadel has been ravaged by the war, & after viewing the tombs you realize what this must have been like before being shelled & bombed. They are working on restoring, but it will be a slow process. Still well worth a look."
"A huge site, the citadel is not to be missed. The temples have elaborate roof crests of mosaic. The gardens are magnificent. There is much to see, so allot plenty of time. It's also best to go with a guide who can explain what you are seeing."
We spent 2-3 hours walking around & despite some of the buildings being closed for restoration it is still worth having a look.
Despite being less than 200 years old it's in a worse state than places we've been to that are over 1000. The main entrance and throne room are impressive but the rest of it is largely forgettable.
"It's a central feature in Hue. A fort that was used as a central palace, modeled after the Forbidden City. Used to rule and defend Vietnam's earlier dynasty (not all that old), it was used as a base of operations during the American-Vietnam war and took heavy shelling. Now it is being systematically restored and the beauty of the reconstruction, along side the remains of the old, is interesting to see."
"Still being restored. An interesting visit which will only get better.

Incidentally, the you can easily walk around the Citadel itself. Don't be conned into taking a bicycle-rickshaw which, incidentally, is more expensive than an air-conditioned car. Just walk or get a taxi to the real front gate where you buy the tickets and go in."
"Hue Citadel covers a huge area and reviews on here double up. The citadel itself is the large fortified central part of Hue surrounded by walls, gates and a moat. Its free to look around and includes cannons and the huge flagpole just inside the walls. To save you a journey - this isn't floodlit at night, much as it would look really nice.
Highlight in the Citadel is the Forbidden Purple City - which is beyond the Noon (Ngo Mon) Gate. It costs 55,000d to get into this part & you could easily spend 3 hours here walking around the grounds and buildings. Its wonderfully peaceful because there are no cyclos. Surprisingly its not on regular tourist itineraries. I highly recommend coming here if you want peace and quiet, A large part is just parkland and ruins, but there are a number of highly ornate restored buildings where Emperors use to live."
"This was the last sight that we saw on our day trip around the area and regrettably we were so tired by this point that we didn't really get to experience it, in all it's glory. I would suggest starting of with the Citadel. It a real shame that so much of it was ruined but they are slowly restoring it and doing a fine job of it."
"This is an amazing place. If possible, have a guide. Hopefully you will have a sunny day to see it, and you will not be in a hurry.

We recommend buying the Eyewitness Guide to Vietnam."
A must! This is the old capital. It has a lot of history and should have some reading before visiting or hire a guide. It's a must see with a lot of history.
"We managed to walk the gauntlet of Cyclo drivers at the entrance and avoid their ""1hour tour"" which would either leave you gasping for breath, rushing or turn into a 3 hour tour with a renegotiated (demanded) price and in which you would have mostly walked, as the cyclos are not actually allowed into all of the sites in the city. Walking the site on our own meant we were able to enjoy the areas we wanted to at our own speed. There is lots to see here albeit in various states of neglect and repair. Try to avoid the Cyclo drivers in Hue. They are notorious. A pair of them dropped us off 3 blocks from our hotel to which they had previously agreed to take us. They obviously wanted to negotiate for more money, but we just paid the agreed amount and walked the rest of the way."
"Wonderful building. Had to climb the steps to it, but it was worth it for the views. Saw some monks reading."
It's worth taking the time to go independently to the Imperial City but take food and drink as there's not much available. There's a lot to see which you won't have the chance to see on a guided tour as they go in and out very quickly. The job of renovation is still ongoing but it's poignant to see the marks of fire and destruction. Some lovely buildings and gardens to wander around with tranquil pools.
"Built in 1804, the fortress is surrounded by a moat and has extensive buildings and gardens throughout. The citadel faces the Huong River (to the east), has hundreds of rooms and there is still visible damage from the war. Initially, Allied forces were ordered not to shell the complex, but as the ferocity of the Tet Offensive grew, there was substantial damage. It is really a massive complex and photos do not capture the true scale of the place. It became a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1993. If in Hue, this is a must see..."
"It is a large ground so I would recommend that if you are not with a guide to take a book with you that will tell you about the different parts of this site. There was a lot of lovely renovated sections that have been completed, but further work is still being carried out during my visit so would be interested to see what it will look like after it is completed."
Largely destroyed during the Tet offensive and going through a large restoration. A great way to spend a few hours wandering through. Recommend to have a guide or join a tour through here.
"Not surprisingly, resembles the Forbidden City in Beijing but with many local twists. Massive damage suffered during the Vietnam War is being steadily rebuilt and renovated but some is so badly damages that it is irreparable."
"Quite nicely restored, so it is worth it. Allow at least 2 hours for the visit. Entrance 110.000 vnd. You can enter only from the main south east gate, close to the flagpole.

At multiple times (see Lonely planet book) you can attend 30 min music & dance show at Royal Theater building, 100.000 vnd. It is not spectacular nor poor. It is just OK, but for that money is a bit expensive.

You can rent a bicycle (30.000 vnd at your hotel) to get there (15 mins)."
Don't waste your time to go there. High ticket price 105.000 vnd for couple of buildings and tennis court. Nothing interesting
Well worth the trip into Hue to see the Citadel. There is a lot of renovation in progress. Allow yourself time to take in all the sites including the gardens.
"The citadel itself is OK but a bad taste was left in the mouth by the scamming at the gate.
The official ticket seller tried to tell us that we had paid the right amount. After twice telling her that we wanted our change, the correct change magically appeared. Funny that she knew how much to give.
A number of people have complained about this. It's a shame that you have to work out the best way to not be scammed, rather than just focus on the best places to go."
"When I arrive in Hue, I will visit this charming place every time. Why not? Because the palace is so spacious and i cann't to walk around in once. This year, I see Hien Lam Cac and all left palace section. I find each incense burner in hien Lam Cac has many meaning for interesting that relation with each king. Some remainder place make feel think about in Glory day. renovation place make full fill old day. I guess If tourists have more time, they should slowly waking to absorb this place.
Nowaday ticket is 105.000 vnd but you can visit the palace and museum near too.
Last you can tack cyclo travel around the citadel in 1 hour for 5 us$ (man will tell 10 us$ first)
Wish you enjoy this place."
"The compound is huge and impressive, It is in the process of restoration and its buildings are used for ongoing changing exhibition, which I find to be nice"
"Hardly surprising that this is a World Heritage Site. Part royal palace, part defensive stronghold. So many buildings to explore and on-going restoration work to see."
It is a small version of their own Forbidden City like in Bejing. That was where the Royal families lived. Took about two hours leisurely to see the place and prepare to walk a lot.
"You need to have good imagination when visiting the Hue imperial city. The site is huge and you need a lot of walking stamina to cover the site. The main and most of the buildings are built during the pre-French occupation period with Chinese influences. The styles and layout are typically based on China famed forbidden palace in Beijing but not as impressive. I would not consider it to be deserving UNESCO heritage status as most of the original buildings were gone. Those around are mostly reconstructed through the support from Soviet Union. As I said you need to imagine the grandness of the palace and various court houses during the period. Nevertheless some old entrance gates and walls still retain a unique mix of tradition Chinese-Vietnamese architecture. If you want to understand the tradition architecture of Vietnam, the Imperial Citadel is a good place to begin with."
"Once the home of the Nguyen monarchs the Citadel is now undergoing restoration work for damage sustained during the American War. Large sections were flattened when US and South Vietnamese forces took it back from the Viet Cong after the Tet offensive of 1968. A Cyclo trip is worthwhile around the outside perimeter which bears witness to the heavy fighting to regain the Citadel.The outside brick walls are studded with holes from both light and medium weapons.
Inside the magnificence of the Nguyen dynasty can be seen in the long colonnaded walks and the opulence of the meeting hall. Out of 160 building only 10 remain due to the heavy fighting which took place there.
I notice one other reviewer mentioned the lady at the gate. She scammed me too."
"We make our way to the Imperial Citadel (Đại Nội), which is one of the highlight in Hue. We bought the tickets directly at the entrance and it cost 105,000 dong per person. I gave the lady a piece of 500,000 dong and she asked for another piece of 10,000 dong so that she could return me 300,000 dong.

The girlfriend walks in eagerly before i even got my change. I followed her into the Citadel but somehow there was just this hunch that something was not right. In my recollection, the lady seems to have taken a few extra movements when she was trying to give me back my change. I pull out the 3 pieces of 100,000 dong and examined it closely and true enough, there was a 10,000 dong in between the 2 pieces of 100,000 dong. I trooped back to the ticket counter and told her she gave me the wrong change and without any hesitation, she instantly returns the exact change to me. I am sure she tried to scam me intentionally therefore she didn't dare to rebut when i asked for the correct change. I was not angry at all but i was in awe with how swift her hands were, and i bet she must have scammed a lot more tourists before me. So be careful and remember to count your change when you are paying for your tickets at the entrance.

Hue was situated close to the border between North and South Vietnam during the Vietnam war, and was open to plenty of destruction and bombardments. There were plenty of flattened area due to the war which can be seen in the citadel, and restorations have only started in the recent years. When Vietnam was reunited after the war, the communist party decided to forsake the entire citadel compound as they see it as a form of remains from the feudal dynasty.

I have never been to the Forbidden City in China but the girlfriend thinks that the Imperial Citadel in Hue is so much lacklustre as compare to the former. Honestly, i believe you can give this place a miss but it is one of the 'highlight' and a UNESCO site n Hue so i reckon just go in early in the morning, have a look but don't spend too much time. 1 hour to 1.5 hours max, that would be enough."
"The Citadel is situated right in the heart of Hue and occupies 520 hectares on the left bank of the Huong River. Many of the building have been restored, but sadly there is still a lot of deterioration and work needed to maintain the site. There really isn't a lot to see which is a shame, as it could be a truly amazing historical palace."
Amazing place - very interesting history. There is so much to see. I was with my 90 year old dad so took a mini bus inside - this was worth the money we paid - I think about 100000 dong. Highly recommend visiting here
"Is Hue Imperial City interesting and nice? Yes. Is it overrated? YES. Does it deserves to be an UNESCO Heritage Site? NO. My opinion.

Apart from that... 105.000 Dongs, corresponding to about 3,59 Eur is a very fair price for the ticket but then, many of the sites withing the Imperial City were being renovated and either not accessible at all or not at its best for the visitors. I liked my visit but if I could go back in the time I wouldn't probably visit Hue."
"Just a wonderful opportunity to see what Imperial Vietnam looked like. Even after the American bombing and near total destruction of the citadel the Vietnamese are hard at work bringing it all back to life. Many of the main halls and galleries are finished and the Chinese Opera House is beautiful. You can watch repair crews hard at work bringing it all together with mortise and tenon joinery.

We worth the trip,"
"This is a massive place in Hue. We were taken round by our guide who explained much of the history of the place. There is much restoration taking place, and there are still signs of the Vietnam War (shell holes through walls)."
"If you have been to Bejing and seen the forbidden city, you realize there is still a lot to repair before all can be shown how it was before. The video which they show in one of the buildings directly after the entrance gives a good impression how immense this city was."
"Huge place, Very ancient, Well worth a visit, Very well looked after and restoring a lot of the ruins"
"It is important to see, particularly with a guide who can explain the history and architecture. I would highly recommend a trip to the Khai Dinh Palace which was my favorite place in Hue."
"The Citadel encompasses a large walled-in area. It is reminiscent of the Forbidden City in China. It is very interesting to see the way the Emperors lived going back to 1802. You will see the Civic, Imperial and Forbidden Purple Cities and appreciate that in the past, we as everyday citizens would never have been able to pass through the doors to see how the Emperors lived."
"The price is a little bit expensive compared to what you get. But it's worth the visit.
First thing to do is watch the documentary about the complex (about 10minutes) to understand what can be found.

Area is quit big, take your time."
Unlike many histotic places the imperial city is still a part of everyday life in Hue.because it is very intact ( although some was lost in the war) you can feel what is was like when the king lived there. not touristy and worth the time
"It is the best attraction of the city, but it is quite expensive (in comparison with other attractions) it cost $105.000 VND."
"There were some organised tours to this place and lots of cabs saying they will take you, ignore them when they say its far, its very close to backpacker area and easy to walk to and around. We were told that it was 55,000 VND for entry but we were charged 110,000! There is quite a bit to see but lots of tourists however still worth a visit."
"Surrounded by moats, a massive structure in Hue north of the Perfume River befitting the former ancient and religious capitol of Vietnam. Make sure you have really good walking shoes. There is plenty of wonderful architecture, as well as gardens and shrines to admire. Visiting the Imperial City within the Citadel is both impressive and informative. Be aware there are certain areas photographs are not allowed. As a veteran of the American War in Vietnam, I took particular interest in the areas of the walls and guard parapit still showing the scars of that conflict."
"A must for the 'bucket list' this impressive building with it's historic interpretation, intricate restoration has loads to offer. After spending 4 hours in the pouring rain i was fascinated each step i ventured in one of the four main quarters each more interesting the last. I did on my own stopping to photography, read and take in the ambience - listening to the various tour guides along the way for details i may have lost. An avid traveller to all parts of the world I would have to say this experience right up there amongst the rest! Not to be missed."
"Compared to the forbidden city in Beijing, this is a medicre copy. Very long walking distance (huge area), but for much of the time not so much things to see. A lot of the areas don't really have anything but road and walls, there is some ground work some places. Some parts(south west end) are beautifully decorated gardens. I was with a group of student, and they lost interest after too much walking. I would take my time in the center part and south west. The rest wasn't that interesting."
"we are very happy to discover this great place, our guide was really good, and you nee done as this is full of history, many things to learn and discover. many pictures to take...."
"Be careful of the uneven surfaces! Much history and an interesting place to learn more. Learn about the housing of women within the Citadel, the kings many wifes and still no children...great story..great history."
"I thought I would be bored seeing the Imperial city as I do not go for palaces that much, but I have to say that the place was fascinating inside and out. We took some fabulous photos there."
Lovely old city with exquisite buildings and wonderful gardens. You need lots of time to explore - it's big. A must for photographers.
I really enjoyed the day at the citadel! Once you are in Vietnam you have motorbikes and cars everywhere and the sound and traffic drive you crazy. Once you enter the citadel the time seems to stop for a while. its so quite in there! Its really nice to find out more about the vietnamese culture and history!
"The Citadel is a perfect site to visit for a morning when in Hue. Entrance fee is VND105000. Wander around the ancient temples at your own pace. Hire a guide or do a little bit of reading yourself before visiting and your trip around the Citadel will become much more interesting.
Tip: bring enough water to drink from outside the Citadel to avoid paying the premium inside."
"Having been to the Forbidden City in Beijing, China, this place pales in comparison. Some restoration works have taken place and are still taking place, but it will take many more years to restore the whole place.

Towards the rear of the grounds, almost everything had been bombed to bits, during the previous War. Fortunately, the front building was left intact.

I walked and saw various parts of the Citadel and 3 different gates."
"This is a great place to visit. It is an interesting way to get a better idea of the early history of Vietnam. Many areas are still being restored, but what is done is well worth a visit. Be prepared to walk, because it does cover a large area. It is a pleasant place to stroll. I would suggest going in the morning when it is cooler."
The imperial city is a must seen when your are in Hue. Its incredibly quiet and you can wander among the buildings and gardens breathing in the history. It is a piece of calm away from the madness of the city.
This is a must when visiting Hue. Walled and moated including purple forbidden city. More amazing for its unexpected and fascinating history. Guided tour helps.
A fairly large complex which gives a good feel of ancient Hue and the dynasty that ruled Vietnamese in the past. Most old building were destroyed during past wars and you can see restoration works in progress.
"If you are in Hue you cannot miss the ""Imperial City"". A piece of Viet Nam story that partially survived at the bombs during the most recent war.
We particularly enjoyed the description made by our local guide that told us many things not written in books or fhe available information boards."
"Frankly, the scale is smaller that my expectation. If you have been to the citadel or palace in China, you may be disappointed for this one, small and not well preserved.
But as a whole with those tomb / monuments, it is still worth to visit Hue."
"The Citadel is like stepping into a time aged fairy tale. While a guide might be useful, i found it much more interesting to just wander the endless walkways and let my mind imagine what it was like to have lived here during its renaissance.

Pleasant, but not to be rushed...several hours would be great in cool weather like January-March."
"Pretty impressive, absolutely huge, so be prepared to spend a lot of time here, and do a lot of walking. The walking is not all flat paths either, some broken ground.

Its a work in progress due to the destruction caused by war, However they are working on restoration continually, and this adds to the charm. still bullet holes all over the place

great historic location"
"The citadel makes for a wonderful afternoon of history. Though the innermost buildings have been destroyed by bombibg, there is a coomendable restoration activity in progress. Do not miss the flower garden"
"It is sad that this attraction was significantly damaged during the war, and restoration work is now underway. Some amazing work has already been done but there is an awful lot more still to do.

We enjoyed our early morning visit when it was comparatively quiet and empty but because we were on a tight schedule arranged by our guide we did not have the time we would have liked to cover the whole site.

To really appreciate it you need to allow at least a half-day and ideally a whole day."
"The ticket system they have is illogical: you pay VND105.000 for the visit which includes the museum, but you cannot phisically and mentally do all that in a single day. So the next day you have to pay the full ticket again! But apart from that, the Citadel and its inner forbidden part are really beautiful."
The Imperial Citadel is a must see when in Hue. The grounds are large with many historic buildings to walk through.
"Hue was a favourite stop of ours in Vietnam, and the citaldel and royal tombs really made it. Such a fascinating history, and so much of it still available to see and witness for yourselves.

We had a great day cycling around the entire citadel - leave a day cos there's lots to see - exploring everything from ruins, historic monuments intact, to some good renovated pieces, to places that form just part of the everyday life of this most ancient of cities. Such a wonderful experience! Would definitely recommend hiring bikes and cycling about to get a real insight and feel for the place."
"Hue Citadel is one of my favorite attraction in Hue.The citadel's constructions is very beautiful and great.It's the interesting reality example about Vietnamese old architecture.The gates is very beautiful with the great traditional flat roof.If you are history lover,this is a great place to visit to know more about Asian traditional.Some of the constructions were destroyed because of war so it is rebuilt and doesn't finish completely 100%.However it is still the good place to see and it give me a great day in Hue."
"A very large, old and interesting site in Hue that is worth spending at least half a day at. From the scale of the surrounding moat and walls, the magnificent temple and galleries, to the bullet marks from recent conflict the Imperial City has much to offer"
"history interesting, however grounds and surrounds unkempt .could be presented better ,do not go there by tuc tuc as price increases dramatically from quote by drivers"
Well worth a couple of visits. Great to wander around... Fascinating but give yourself plenty of time to see it all.
"One needs a good imagination and guide to get the most out of this tour. on the face of it there is not so much to see as the site was almost raised during the war with France. However, the shear scale of the area of the 'forbidden city' is incredible, and the few strustures which are being carefully restored are certainly worth it. we were lucky to have a guide whose grandfather was a manderin to the last Emporer, and had personal memories of growing up there. Priceless personal insight.
The only downside was that it was raining and we got cold !"
"For anyone visiting Hue, this is worth seeing. The architecture is both beautiful and interesting, and offers an insight into the fascinating history of this former capital city."
Best to go early to miss the coach parties. Once you are within the citadel walls the city has lots of trees and a pleasant setting. You can take a cyclo ride around the streets which is a great way to see the local life. Our drivers were very funny and although their English was limited we got on very well. They would stop to let us take photos whenever we asked. A good way to get around. Our ride was included but ask for a price first. They are not the luxury cyclo but good fun.
"We booked a tour through our hotel. Our tour guide was very informative. Even though we would have liked to have spent more time there, having a guide was very helpful and I would recommend having one."
"it was very interesting to see the imperial city, It's a nice day out. Really large so you need a few hours to explore, has a huge Chinese influence. A lot of it has been damaged by the war, the entry fee is high but you could easily spend a whole the morning in the citadel."
Worth visiting if you have time in Hue. It was raining so we bought a poncho and were able to look around the place with ease.
"The Citadel is very large and resembles the Forbidden City in Peking. The amount of walking is substantial. We had a great guide who gave us an overview of the history of the structure. You need a great deal of time to really see the Citadel. There are carts with drivers that you SHOULD
definitely use. It is also advisable that you do some reading before you visit
as there is so much to see. The gift shop is large and has reasonable prices."
"This is a citadel you could not miss in Hue, place for former king of Vietnam works. A lot of historic sites around. Visit in the morning before 11am is the best!"
"The weather was pretty awful, raining and some parts of the Citadel are quite muddy which probably contributed to the lack of tourists about.
Interesting place with lots of beautiful buildings and history. It is in the middle of what I suspect is a massive restoration programme which will probably take many years to complete.
We enjoyed our visit."
We walked around the place. It was pretty quiet and peaceful. We went by ourselves and not with tour guides or local friends so we didn't learn much about the place other taking a bunch of pictures. We were there when they were working on some restoration project and it was cool to see some woodwork done.
"Nice sight, pleasure to walk around and not packed with tourists. Restoring lots of buildings so nice to see a mix of traditional and restored. They do a show in the theatre within the site which is worth a look."
It help me know more about history of Vietnam.The citadel maybe it doesn't big but it has some thing very interesting and great.Many structures were destroyed because of war so I think it must be rebuilt.The citadel is the best place in Hue.
This is a ruin in many ways but full of history and very interesting. It is hard to find out exactly how much we in the West are responsible for the destruction over the centuries.
Did this as part of a tour of Vietnam. Very similar in many ways to parts of the Forbidden City but with individual touches.
"As with most tourist attractions it is overrun with tourists which makes it difficult to get a good feeling of the place. Nevertheless a fascinating place despite not being very old, started in early 19th century, having suffered during the war and needing a lot more conservation, although so e is under way."
"Visited here Sunday am - entrance fee 105k VND each. The complex took us around 2.5hrs to walk around. I took many great photos here as the mix of architecture and plants/trees make for great visuals. The complexes are well kept and some proper restoration is in progress. There are dance performances too - extra cost 100k VND. There are places to relax, sit and reflect, you can get drinks/ices but they are expensive - recommend bring your own! Great time here !"
"It was very interesting to see the imperial city, especially in contrast to others that I have seen in China and Thailand. There is an excellent short film in one of the buildings that shows the history of the sight. As well, there were a couple of art exhibits. A highly recommended stop in Hue."
"it was interesting to see the different buildings, its a shame that a lot of this city was distroyed by bombs. Some of the restoration work on the buildings are very good, hopefully they will leave some parts as they are, not to make it look new."
"It's a nice day out. Really large so you need a few hours to explore, has a huge Chinese influence. A lot of it has been damaged by the war & you can see all the bullet holes in the walls. It's quite expensive to get in 105,000vnd pp but you can see all the work they've done to restore & loads of staff working to maintain the gardens."
Unfortunately a lot of the city was destroyed during the war but there is still lots to see and explore. There is a lot of restoration work going on which is a bit of an eyesore but I think you need to look past that! The entry fee is high but you could easily spend a whole afternoon in the citadel so is not outrageous.
"We spent nearly all day wandering in the citadel and forbidden city. The forbidden city is spectacular, otherwise the citadel is just a normal town. Forbidden city is excellent if you are interested in oriental garden architecture."
"Hue is a relatively small town. You can see the citadel in one long morning then explore the town on bikes or go on a bike food tour. We used Hue Street Food Tour and really enjoyed it. Beware the ""son"" of the quaint cafe owner outside the citadel gate offering you a motorcycle ride over the Hi Van pass. It's not a good price. Better to go to an established travelers cafe in the tourist district and arrange transport there.

After visiting Saigon or Hanoi, the slow pace is nice and it is easier to bike around. Like Hoi An it's not very busy and they are used to tourists so the drivers are less aggressive around tourists then in the big cities."
"I spent a few hours on my own walking through buildings and ruins. I could just imagine what it would have looked like in its hey day.

Advice: They don't tell you this when you buy your entry ticket BUT if you want to visit the Royal Tombs on another day, be sure to ask at the ticket office for the Royal Tomb top up to your entry ticket. It will save you a lot of money!"
The citadel was very interesting. There were people in colourful national dress which made taking photos so much more relevant to the country. I was intrigued with the history of the place.
"We decided to make our own way to the citadel. But the whole of the time going and returning we were constantly pestered by rickshaw peddlers.Surely no means no in any language, but not here.
The citadel is over a large area and has some interesting buildings, although they were very much the same. At least here it was peaceful!!"
"this was the remaining place from the MING dynasty of china.. i went there too late (5 pm) so they already closed. since I cant go through inside the castle, so I've only look around the outside of the castle.. it was a pretty good place which can gave you a heroic but emotional on the other hand"
"What a delightful experience, even in the pouring rain. Thank goodness that the structures have survived and restoration is under way. The best area was a walk over from the entrance. Do not miss Hung Mieu, The Mieu, The Urns, and The Hien Lam Pavilion. Restoration is outstanding. To be able to walk through these areas with no crowds was so impressive. To be able to freely walk in these historic sites is a privilege. Do not miss out if you are in the area."
"I have been around Vietnam for 6 months, and Hue Citadel was a disappointment. You pay 120'000 VND for the entrance (usually 20'000 VND in any other place) and you get into a place with rubbish all around, some of the buildings are covered then you can't even see them. The photo exhibition was in bad condition. And in the end, you found A TENNIS COURT, in the middle of the citadel (this one was in really good condition)."
"Great experience. The combination of nicely reconstructed buildings and ruins is excellent giving you a feeling for both the original splendor and the violent and destructive periods. Fantastic that you can wander around freely almost everywhere, very few areas are closed."
"It was a big complex, where we walked a lot. It was great to walk here and fantasies about the way people lived here. We were impressed by the details the used on the buildings and the spacious rooms."
Such a beautiful place. We spent the best part of the day here just exploring . It's good to see the government is restoring it and I'd love to see it in the future. Just so grand. Definitely not a thing to miss in Hue
This site was very cool. In a sort of state of flux right now between the old broken pieces of terra cotta and tiling and faded reds and the renovated sparkling red and golden columns. Still has a feel of exploring something just unearthed after a hundred years of being abandoned and bombed but I think given the exponential progress of this country will be a tourist trap (although a beautiful one) in no time.
"Although i had under an hour so literally WHIZZED around the place, what I did see was very beautiful. I am not sure if because it had been raining a lot of the time, but there was hardly anyone else here so wonderful for photo purposes with out it being dotted with other random tourists. I definitely would have loved to have spent more time here."
The citadel as many a story to tell and although large chunks are in ruin you can still spend hours walking around the site.
I was really looking forward to looking around but after the amazing splendour of the royal tombs there is not much to see as sadly it was heavily bombed.
"The two main reasons for visiting Hûe ought to be this citadel, sometimes referred to as the yellow city, and the tombs surrounding the town itself. I had at my hands limited time and didn't do the later ones. But I did the citadel, the yellow city is a reference to its bigger brother in Beijing, the forbidden city, that is referred to as the red city. This smaller copy in central Vietnam though is in much worse shape, at least externally as some of the interiors are seemingly newly restored. I personally didn't have the luxury of a guide and I actually got a little confused where to walk and not to. The site also was pretty heavenly damaged durring the US war so that might be the answer of some of the decay as Vietnam was pretty har embargoed after the war.
Even though given its bad shape I would still say that if your in the area go visit, but be prepared of the decay..."
"This was probably the highlight of our short visit to Hue after a boat trip down the Perfume river. We gained an interesting insight into some of Vietnam's past.
We did have the advantage of our own guide to take us round and explain everything to us, so did not have the issue raised by some other reviewers."
Absolutely fascinating well worth a visit and we visited on a rainy day. Allocate at least a half day and ideally a day. There is a fair amount of restoration in progress but it didn't take away from the experience.
"The Citadel was really interesting to see, before going we read many reviews on here that said it was poorly signposted etc. After doing a bit of searching, we found a 'walking tour' of the complex http://splashurl.com/l3aldtb that explained as we went. I can see how otherwise it would be a little underwhelming but with this explanation i found this site very interesting! Was really good to see restoration work being undertaken on the remaining buildings."
"Considering this is the main attraction for the imperialist city of Hue, it's a huge let-down. There is insufficient signage to explain the history behind the citadel and its various elements, so you're left to wander around without comprehension. Some areas are half-finished construction sites whose corrugated fencing and tarpaulin sheets spoil what remains of the ancient ruins. Furthermore, when we finally made our way out of the Citadel (the exit is frustratingly on the other side to the entrance) the tyres on our bikes had been deflated. A nearby rickshaw rider serendipitously offered to convey us and our bikes to a facility to repair the tyres - all for a fee of course. Instead we cycled back to hotel on flat tyres feeling no wiser on the Citadel's history than when we went in. I would avoid this attraction if you can and spend time exploring something else."
"Of all the tourist venues we visited, this was quite disappointing, esp considering it had the highest entrance fee. There is no real organisation to the place asude from the revenue gathering. One is left to wander without any signage as to what the place has to offer.
There are no barriers to stop you walking into areas which should be cordoned off as they are hazardous.
The main emperors building containing his throne is impressive. Otherwise it is all a bit ho hum. We were more impressed with the pagoda up the road which incidentally is free!"
"This should be the highlight of the Hue visit, but (and I am simplifying) a bunch of reconstructed buildings from the 19th century. So , nothing particularly impressive for a relatively recent construction. Worth visiting to understand more about Vietnamese history. The visit to the tombs of the emperors is perhaps more interesting."
"Overwhelming wealth which make us understand the reason for revolution. We had a very good guide who told us much history.
It is recommended to spend some time here. It is quite a lot to see."
"It ids being rebuilt after destruction in the war, but it is definitely worth a visit. The reconstructed bits are incredible"
We enjoyed the Citadel- it was very grand in nature and was such a large attraction- it took a while for us to explore. As a fan of architecture I was very impressed with the buildings and their design. There are a lot of tourists but the grounds are spacious enough so you don't feel crowded in. Definitely the best attraction in Hue and a must see.
"I spend a full day here. Entrance fee is 105.000 VND.

The central part of the Royal Palace is destroyed, restoration seems very slow but you can figure out what was what.

The Theatre is still intact and worth a visit but the main attractions are in the southern and easterly part of the Citadel (turning to your left after having visited Thai Hoa Palace, passing the pretty big lawn area).
After your visit you will know the setups of a Chinese palace, temple and pagoda for sure and you will know how important Feng Shui is for Vietnamese.

If you need a break go to the very end of the Citadel and out over the bridge (make sure the guard remembers you to get back in) and up the stairs. There is a nice Cafe there in the middle of the moat.

Oh and don't worry too much about the ""change of guard""..."
"We came here without a guide and learned very little. There are no explanatory signs at any of the buildings, you just need to guess what they are used for. The only explanation I found was a short animated video explaining the citadel layout, but even this was ruined by a tour guide loudly barking his own commentary to his group. The very few buildings that have been renovated contain photograph galleries of irrelevant sights elsewhere in Vietnam. Elsewhere there are ugly sheds with corrugated iron roofing and tennis courts that look completely out of place, ruining any landscape photos. No effort is made to demonstrate how the people lived in its glory days. If this was a well run citadel there would be people in period fancy dress, authentic music, and free toilets - there is none of that here.

Also annoying is the fact you cannot exit at the same place as the entrance, so it's a 15 minute walk around the outside. We had left our bikes at the entrance and returned to find that our tyres had mysteriously been deflated. All became clear when a rickshaw driver sat nearby 'happened to notice our distress' and 'had the great idea' of taking us and our bikes to a local station where there was a bicycle pump. For a fee, of course. When we turned down his 'kind' offer and rode off on flat tyres, he followed us like a hound, shouting that what we were doing was extremely dangerous."
"This ""imperial"" city pales in comparison to any other I have visited in Asia. It is NOT worthwhile, time wise or expense. The Royal Museum can be seen in 5 minutes and isn't worth the time except for the unusually clean WC by Vietnamese standards."
This was a great place to visit but as another review said there was a lot of construction as they're trying to rebuild some of the structures. It is a very large place so expect to spend at least a day here. We didn't have enough time to properly visit the whole place.
"I would definitely recommend going to the Citadel, it is vast, hot to work, but taking a cylco there and back, with them waiting for you was a relief. Buy water before you go in, pricey inside. It does have a lot of structural damage but nevertheless I think its presenting well and interesting to view. It is vast though. Don't miss great for a morning out."
"It is very interesting place to visit but at that time I visited it, it is being rebuilt so that I couldn't visit everything completely. To visit there, it is good to visit all for 1 day. It is very comfortable to visit it around by walking."
"its has now been renovated after the terrible damage of the war. some beautiful buildings, excellent repainting, lovely trees. Also a theatre where we saw an unexpectedly enjoyable dance and music show"
"We found the imperial city very enjoyable on many fronts. It felt ethereal on the misty morning we visited and made for a peaceful stroll through many beautiful ruins. A number of buildings were actually in a decent state of repair or restoration so you do get a good insight into what the city would have looked like, though the massive devastation caused by the American War is also blatant. The DVD they play in the first building is worth watching as it digitally reconstructs the city which helps set the context. I also loved the display of courtly costumes - the embroidery is exquisite (even my boyfriend enjoyed this bit!) There are some lovely gardens and lakes along the way too if you take the time to wander around."
"This is the main tourist attraction of Hue and hence is not to be missed. Like all historic sites if you love history you'll enjoy it even more. However, it worth just visiting to walk around and feel the history."
This walled city is definately worth a visit for a number of photo opportunities. The kids loved feeding the Gold Fish. It is gradually being rebuilt as a lot of it was destroyed during the war. That said we spent 2 hours wandering around.
"Yes, I was expecting more than what is left today, thanks to the U.S. bombings during the ""war"".
They are restoring it slowly (lack of funds), but just let your imagination run wild, and you can feel what it was like before. Use a local guide otherwise you will be disappointed. Worth a visit for sure."
"I really enjoy the visit, prepare to walk... So wear comfortable shoes.
Unfortunately the purple forbidden city has been lost by bombs, but you can still feel the grandeur of the imperial city."
"during the battle of hue in the vietnam war this place really took a pounding, read about it and it will make your visit more interesting. It is basically four massive wall surrounded by a moat which the americans fortified and built an airstrip inside. Then during the battle of Hue the place got bombed in to the stoneage with just the substantial main walls left standing. You can see it all certainly in 1/2 day to a day. good to tick off the list but thats about it, dont expect historical remnants."
"Being restored bit by bit. Take a guided tour to get the most out of your visit. Comfortable and overcast during our December visit, ideal warmth for sightseeing."
One of the best things to see in/around hue and an easy way to spend an entire morning/afternoon. probably worth taking a tour if you don't have a good guide book with you
"If you go to Hue, youi're probably going for the citadel. We regretted going cause it was not worth the trip to Hue. Its mostly under construction because of renovation since a big part was bombed or otherwise just aged. There's very little to see. Especially if you have already been traveling a bit through SE-Asia, this will not amaze you. If you're having doubts about going to Hue, just skip it and move on to either Hoi An or Phong Nha Ke Bang."
"This is probably the best place to visit in Hue itself. It's just a pity that America just bomb the hell out of it.

Great for a stroll and theatre house is amazing.

Thanks for reading."
"Many buildings inside the Citadel have been destroyed, but there are enough left to make a visit of the Hue Citadel worthwhile. We were quite impressed and enjoyed almost a whole day of walking around there (even though it was raining on and off) and many unexpected photo-opportunities. Recommended!"
"First of all. I know the imperial city was hit hard by american bombs. This is what they usually do in their liberation wars. Destroy valuable historical sites. But its 40 years and here it looks like 5 years ago. It should be pride of Hue but its not well maintained and still under reconstruction. Its going very slowly though. They fix main gate now. Purple city itself is empty building with only emperors seat. Situation was saved with digital video of how it looks when it was in best times. It was gorgeous place but its little hard to get that feeling now. The entry fee is 5$ what is quite a lot but I get it now. We white people destroyed it so we must contribute now.

Its must visit after all. Its what Hue is all about. Ancient capital city."
"I was rather underwhelmed by the Citadel. It's a very large site with a very large amount of history, however, time and the bombing during the war have reduced this site mostly to ruins and rubble. Very little of the interesting bits are intact, and the most interesting part of the Purple Palace is off-limits.

This is probably the easiest tourist destination in Hue to get to, but its worth getting out of the city to the tombs instead.

There's very little explanatory material, so perhaps a guide would make a helpful addition to this tour. In my view there was little to positively recommend this location."
"This impressive citadel was built during the reign of the Nugyen Dynasty that ruled Vietnam for over 140 years. It is well worth visiting if you are interested in the complex history of the country. The citadell was badly damaged during the American war on Vietnam but is curently being reconstructed and there is much to admire today. It is worthwhile reading up a little on the history of Vietnam to enhance an understanding this site. A book called ""Saigon, an epic story of Vietnam"" by Anthony Grey is a must read for this purpose. Even if history is not your interest, it is a remarkable and beautiful site. We spent four hours exploring the many components of the citadel and were not dissappointed. Bring your own drinks and snacks if you are worried about costs as these are expensive within its walls. A great way to spend half a day."
"Hue is full of scammers. Spend as little time in town as possible and go straight to the citadel and then the tombs are a must. This is speaking from experience as I have ridden a motorbike down vietnam and been to many places both inland and on the coast. Hue was the only place that left a bitter taste.

The citadel is enormous and the main gate is currently under reconstruction with a new roof. The whole complex is quite extraordinary definately worth a visit. It takes about 3 hours to see the citadel, more if you see the display about the Vietnamese education system currently in place. The walls are still highly intact but understandable given their short history of 200 years."
"Hué´s Citadel is amazing. It is very big, very well decorated and I kept imagining how life was in there 200 years ago. I really loved this visit."
Supposedly this is fashioned after the Forbidden City in China. If you have been there you will be greatly disappointed by The Citadel. There is history here but war and time have done some serious damage. The grounds are fairly large and nice for an afternoon stroll.
"What a wonderful experience. Thinh was a monk for 11 years and added so much more with his understanding of the culture and the pride of Vietnamese people. He is not just a tour guide, Thinh is very special. If you can sit in a chair you can get on the back of his scooter, he is careful. Maximum tour is 4 people. It was just two of us and day two it rained and even with the weather we had a wonderful time. Highly recommend this to anyone. Nancy & Reg. Canada"
"The ancient citadel of the Vietnamese dynasty was a magnificent place. Although they are working to restore parts of it, most of the buildings were destroyed during the wars of the 1960s and 70s. What has been restored is wonderful, but there is a long way to go. I hadn't realized the extent of the damage before we arrived, therefor my disappointment."
We were so pleased we did a half day tour with a private guide as the city is so big you could wander round aimlessly and not see the best parts. Having said that if we had being staying in hue longer we probably would have visited again on our own. A must do!
"Very beautiful, well worth the visit of your in Hue, the round trip from the city center and the total time you will spend is approximately 3-6 hours depending if your with a guided tour or going solo.

For this place I recommend a guided tour unless you have a book and have done plenty of research on the site so you can go solo.

Back some water and a few snacks and enjoy how nature is slowly reclaiming the ancient structures."
"First of all, know that this place is fantastically huge! I got so tired walking around! Large courtyards and many corridors that branch off, this place will test your endurance. They have a nice video that has a digital reconstruction of the entire fort, try to catch it. It's quite fascinating. But before you enter, get a hang of the layout of the place. Plan your way around, that way you can be more efficient. Often, one side is just the mirror of the other and so there is no need to see everything.

But a must visit place. Spend half a day here."
I wasn't expecting much after seeing what the Americans did to My Son but was pleasantly surprised and impressed by the restoration work done to date. The site was not that old...only 200 years but it was still well worth seeing.
"We enjoyed walking around all the buildings. The information provided was very good and the intro film was well thought out.
Make sure you take you own drinks and snacks as the few café here will charge you huge amount of dong for very little. They were taking the p%%%"
"I'm more into natural attractions (water falls, caves, etc), but I still managed to enjoy the Imperial City. Much of the city is under reconstruction, but there are still a number of buildings and areas to explore. The complex is fairly large and took me about 3 hours to check out. There are a number of nice temples and complexes on the west side. My favorite spot was the small but beautiful palace in the northwest corner (not sure what the name is).

Entrance cost is currently 105,000vnd. Once inside I recommend checking out the informational video that plays in the back room of the main palace at the south end of the complex (straight ahead when you enter). Also, try to find a decent map of the Imperial City because it is very helpful when wandering around trying to find the attractions!

In summary, I enjoyed meandering around the Imperial City and was ok with paying the entry fee. It wasn't amazing, but was relaxing and had some nice architecture. I recommend visiting during cool weather and when there are few visitors (perhaps early morning) for a more peaceful and comfortable experience."
"Couldn't believe the size of the place and wasn't ready for all of the buildings, complete and in repair."
"Whilst a lot of palaces were destroyed in the citadel in the Vietnam war its still very pleasurable and a lot to see the area is far to big to walk around, but possible if you start out early .Dont use those pedal bike taxis, its starts at 100,000 dong and ends up at a million .im not stupid with money , but i did get caught out by them, getting caught on the sympathy trip.tip.You can get some electric courtesy buses at the main entrance so ask about them i think but i saw them later on and there arnt too many about from what i saw .However enough belly acheing this site is well worth the trip one of the highlights of my trip to vietnam not so touristy, as Hoyan and after the city very quiet and peaceful."
"Not a whole lot to see at this attraction. Much is either still under or awaiting construction.
Some people compare it to the Forbidden City in Beijing. There is no comparison. We were pretty underwhelmed."
"The place is quite nice and was undergoing some level of restoration when we visited. There is a lot to see and also a lot of gimmicks inside, including dressing up in imperial clothes for a photography session... The Citadel is quite vast and spread out, it is by far not the most awe inspiring historical place I have seen but it was certainly worth going to see such an important part of Hue's history."
"Had a good look around. Very enjoyable. A lot of buildings destroyed during the war. Lots of walking to be done inside the walls.

Hired 2 bikes from hotel for €2 & cycled around the walls & Around the city of Hue. Great way of getting around. Cycling quiet safe even if you are a nervous cyclist like myself!"
"I really enjoyed seeing the Citadel while in Hue. Unfortunately I was only able to spend an hour running around to see as much as I could as I did not have enough water, the sun was beating down on me, and my partner was waiting for me. Thus I would recommend bringing an ample amount of water depending on the season you visit and allowing for a couple hours or more to be spent walking and looking around. There is a lot to see and learn and incredible photos to be taken. I walked all the way to the end opposite the main entrance and found an area where all the banzai-type trees and numerous other plants were being grown and tended to. It's just beautiful. And I love history so this place was fabulous for that as well."
"The area in the inner walls, while pleasant to stroll around, is rather stark and uninviting. The exception is the theatre, a very ornate interior straight out of a 1940s flick. The most picturesque parts are actually outside, the queen mother's gardens out the north gate, the bonsai gardens and antiquities museum out the east gate. One of the electric bus tours may be a good idea as there is a lot of pointless walking to do."
Definitely worth a look if you're going to Hue. It's pretty massive and interesting. Wasn't overly pleased to see the elephants chained up though.
This Citadel and surrounding old city is very interesting and if you like photography some great creative shots. As an attraction it is average and worth seeing if you are in the area but I would not travel there specially for this. There are some interesting surrounding areas as well with fishing towns on the water...
"For those who have visited the Forbidden City in Beijing, you will find this historic site a terrific and extraordinary one."
"Although thoroughly bombed out by the US in 1968, there is still much history and culture to see here. The Citadel is currently being rebuilt to its old splendor but there continues to be much to enjoy...make sure you have a good guide or you will miss much"
amazing history of the grounds with so much to see. Can take hours wandering around through all the buildings and seeing the artifacts. Very informative
"Unique experience, a must see and do it on a bicycle. Loved walking around all the buildings and walkways around the walls and lawns. Truly incredible.
A cool way to mix it up is to dress up for $3 in emporers clothes and pose on a throne in one of the original buildings. Lots of fun and good for a laugh!
There's a fabulous performance of live theatre here too, across the park in the performance building - traditional dancing, singing, instruments I have never seen before and gorgeous use of lanterns during the show. Well worth the 100 000 dong ($5) for a very talented and entertaining show. Shame their were more performers than audience. A class act worth seeing!"
"If you've been to the forbidden city in Beijing - this one is kind of similar, but 1/10th in size, half destroyed and another half under construction.
The citadel was mentioned in my guide book as one of the top things to see in Vietnam - so my expectations were high and in the end I was quite disappointed.

But without having much expectation, the place is worth an hour visit."
"The cycle tuk tuks charge by the hour, so beware when stopping to take pictures and seeing the inside of the Citadel as they charge per hour and your stops are not included in the hour."
"You can tell that the history lays behind the place. Once you arrived, you can see the big vietnam flag, which tells you that the power of vietnam (was) there. The imperial city is under renovation (visited dec 2013), but it is still beautiful. Worth to visit."
The main entrance building was stunning and some interesting exhibits inside. After leaving this building however I quickly lost interest. The grounds were beautiful however there wasn't really an awful lot to see considering the amount of walking we had to do. There was an interesting museum but not memorable. So much of the place was destroyed so there wasn't much original history left. The whole place was a little odd really.
"Well placed and organised, still in the process of being rebuilt. Unfortunately none of the building are the originals to my knowledge. No restaurants in the city itself except snacks. The Oil Painting shop inside is a must see"
"We enjoyed touring the imperial palace but found it somewhat bizarre. The imperial palace was only built in the early/mid 1800s and was severely damaged during WWII and again during the Vietnam War ... so much of what you see is fairly new/remodeled ... and the history behind the emperors/dynasty is fairly new too (less than 200 years old). All of that said, the palace as great symbolism in Vietnam and if you are in Hue, it is definitely worth a visit."
"Interesting insight to their history. Hawkers at the entrance typical
Hindrance. Heaps of taxi at gates for a quick departure"
The site is huge and sprawling and can be a bit daunting if you don't know where you are going. It was a bit disappointing to see so much scaffolding at the main entrance to the Imperial City but there is much restoration work taking place and it can't be rushed. Having said that there was a lot to see (except in the Purple Forbidden City which is being rebuilt having been destroyed during the war. Other areas are much more impressive at the moment). More information would have been helpful and a guide is really a must if you are interested in the history of the place. Fortunately there are a number of outlets where you can buy water or ice creams - it can be very hot and shade is limited. For a few pence you can feed the huge Koi in the pond just inside the main entrance.
"We enjoyed our stroll around the imperial city. We didn't book a tour, we decided to just stroll and take it all in. it's a large site and there is also alot to see around it.

Be carefull not to get sunburnt like I did, there is alot of outdoor walking."
"Our visit to The Citadel during our 2-day stay in Hue was pretty underwhelming for a few reasons. First - it really did not provide the information needed to understand what life was actually like in the imperial city and failed to bring history to life in a way that many other UNESCO sites & historical areas do. Second - the lack of any kind of official tour, ESPECIALLY for the price, left us feeling a bit cheated.

Overall, I would say that it is wise to skip The Citadel in favor of spending more time visiting the Pagodas and Tombs surrounding Hue."
"Be sure to take in the beautifully restored To Mieu Temple Complex in the southwest corner of this sprawling walled city. In the second floor of the building just south of the Emperor's Reading Room there are nice drawings and a model of the main buildings of the Forbidden City, which were destroyed during the war."
"As UNESCO and Hue continue to reconstruct the past in this site it may come more alive, but on our visit we felt a bit lost in the huge space and didn't really get a good feeling for the kind of different lives people in the royal entourage lived on the premises.

Meanwhile, one can truly wander around for hours/days among the ruins."
"This is without doubt one of the most beautifull spots we have visited till now in Vietnam, beautifull buildings (although a lot of restoration is in progress) in an oasis of a quiet, very restfull, secluded area..
A "" must do"" when in Hue !"
"You get a real feel of the scale of this place when you are there, worth taking a guided tour of this vast site as the history is fascinating. A great place to visit."
You can take this vast monument and former capital city of the Nguyen dynasty as part of a tour or just enjoy a walk at your own time
"The citadel is a bit rough around the edges but that adds a lot of charm, it leaves a lot to the imagination"
"Amazing place and story, great insight into the Vietnamese recent history. Pay for a tour guide to get the most out of the visit. Arrange privately"
"This fortress calls strong memories of Bejing's Forbidden (Emperial) City. But although it is still an impressive site, lot's of it has been destroyed in the wars that raged Vietnam in the 20th century. But still worth the visit, both for it's splendour as for the remeberance of what people can do to heritage."
"During our visit, the weather was poor and a lot of the paths were muddy and this was a bit of a put-off. We would have thought that all paths would have been in good order as this would help with erosion etc.
The audio visual show was very interesting and gave you a good insight of how it used to be.
There is a lot of renovation occurring so the complex should be fantastic when complete."
"It was pretty but we liked the Tu Duc tomb better.

As an FYI - either take a taxi and ask him to wait for you OR know if you walk, it's not too far from the DMZ bar area BUT if you don't know the language (we didn't) then it looks like you can't get in through the front middle gate. Don't be fooled. You can hop that little fence keeping the traffic out. We had guys yelling at us in Vietnamese/English that we couldn't go in that way by walking and we learned the hard way that they were just jerks wanting our money to take them by cyclo."
"Big enough to visted there, it took 2 hours untill rain not so interested, I will be back on summer, I think that that be good time to visit more out side of imperial have alot museum must to see same like TAnk museum, art museum too"
"Wow, you need a couple of hours to spend here. I could not believe how beautiful the buildings, gates and surrounds were with a moat most of the way around.How stunning it must have been in it's day."
"Although most of the buildings are closed or covered in tarp, this is a must-do in Vietnam. It is an important historical site. You see how massive the grounds when you arrive, and that huge flag! We felt that it was worth it to spend an hour walking around and learning about the citadel and its history."
"My friends and I took a cab to the citadel, full of eagerness and curiosity about its supposed grandeur and ancient beauty. Before we could even appreciate the magnificence of the ancient city, we were deterred by the exorbitant entrance fee. The tickets for locals are sold at 75,000 dong, which is fairly reasonable. However apparently there are also tickets for tourists and at tourist price. It was sold at 105,000 dong, which is 50% more than the local price.

This jacked-up price is not uncommon in Hue. But it got onto our nerves and we decided to spend the money on great Vietnamese cuisine instead.

So my recommendation is...don't bother going to the citadel if you're on a shoestring. Definitely not worth the money, especially when there is reconstruction."
"The Citadel is the Vietnam equivalent of the Forbidden City and if you have have visited that you can imagine the splendor of the site. Unfortunately the damage inflicted by the Viet Cong & American War was catastrophic and very little of the original buildings remain. There is extensive rebuilding underway and what you can see is impressive. We were lucky that there very few visitors when we went (as it was very wet) but in 20 years time it could be just as busy as Beijing. Go now, enjoy what is there and the relative quiet."
"Inevitably comparisons will be made with Beijing's Forbidden City but Hue's Imperial City is magnificent in its own right although more modest in scale and looking a bit worn. There are different temples, courtyards, royal residences, artwork, gardens, etc to explore which brings Vietnam's imperial history to life. Parts of this complex were ravaged by bombings and other areas showed signs of wear and tear, but it is heartening to see that restoration works are happening to make the past even more vivid. When we were there on a weekday afternoon, the atmoshere seemed subdued and almost reverential...which was a nice contrast to the push and shove experienced in Beijing. Half a day will be sufficient to get the most out of this historical site."
"designed like the Bejing forbidden city, which I haven't visited, but it's probably a lot less touristy since it hasn't been all fixed up."
"The sheer size and breadth of the Imperial City is impressive, but I found it's architecture pretty standard - the local imperial tombs have a lot more pizzazz. You definitely need to visit it and then you can decide for yourself."
"I was greately surprised by Hue's citadel, especially the temples on the west side. Not only the buildings are beautiful and he art impressive, but the area is a little oasis in the middle of the never-ending beeping and engine sounds of the city. An important number of structures were bombed during the different invasions, so the citadel is not complete. It's still something you shouldn't miss if visiting Hue. I felt transported in time, such an amazing place. Allow 2-3 hours, take water and be ready to walk!"
Very wet when we visited but the whole area was an architect's dream. Outstanding grounds - vast area.
"This is THE reason to go to Hue to see this ancient city with its architecture, gardens, art, etc. I would recommend getting a guide to enhance this experience."
"You can wonder here for hours and finding more and more palaces and beautuiful places. Come here in the morning, before nine. Then just wonder around and see Hue citadel in its all beauty. Amazing place!"
"I guess this is the Vietnam equivalent of Beijing's Forbidden City.

The place is huge, raking up acres of land, and we walked over the very place that officials used to congregate for meetings with the Vietnamese Emperor. There's also the hall in which His Majesty himself sits, which is nothing short of commanding. What makes this hall even more interesting is the debate of which 20 pillars in the hall are actually true, untouched originals, left from the olden days, and which are NOT part of this 20 pillars, ie. modified and reinforced versions in the hall.

We were introduced to the entire compound by way of a miniature 3D map. Some parts of the City were under renovation when I visited but the place is so humongous, it's not like I'm going to walk every nook and corner anyway.

Very interesting, humbling just to see how huge the Emperor's citadel is. Definitely worth a visit."
"This was very interesting to learn the history although quite a hot day it was nice to wander around, in and out and to keep in the shade."
"I'm sure the citadel would be a great landmark and stop as you head through Vietnam, but it is currently under reconstruction, so you are going to get limited access to everything. The Citadel is a very beautiful thing to see, but unless you are heading to the surrounding tombs as well, then the citadel is pretty much the ONE thing you will want to see in Hue. My opinion, skip Hue all together unless you want to spend money consistently being underwhelmed. When the construction is done, I am sure my opinion will change, but as it stands now, the citadel (110,000 Dong) and each of the tombs (outside of town 4-12km, 80,000 Dong/each) are a waste of a trip when you could spend that time in Hoi-An or Hanoi."
"We have traveled 43 different countries. We have seen excellent and not so good sites in all of our travels.

Even with the best open mind possible, we simply cannot recommend visiting this site for the time being. The site should have simply been closed during renovations.

a. The site is mostly under reconstruction, not just renovations. That is what should be clearly told to visitors.
b. There are very few areas that offer any historical content other than a throne, drawings, images and texts on walls.
c. Visitors end up walking through large empty fields where long grass, piles of rocks and approximate walk paths all contribute to a sense of total neglect.
d. Of course, no indications exist to guide visitors through a minimal visit itinerary.
e. An attraction has been set up to encourage visitors to rent a royal costume and be photographed on a fake throne. Of course, it does not attract any visitor. Employees assigned to this doubtful proposal were simply sleeping here and there when we visited. Very regrettable image to project.

Our conclusion: this site should be closed for 3-5 years while reconstruction and renovations take place. It is not acceptable to ask any visitor to pay for the site in its present condition."
"We spent almost a whole day exploring the Imperial City and enjoyed it just as much if not more than our trip to Angkor Wat, just for some perspective. The grounds are beautiful and the parts they have finished restoring transport you back in time to the Nguyen dynasty, but the crumbling portions are even more breathtaking and exciting. We had so much fun climbing through the grasses up hills to half way destroyed terraces. Not only do you get a glimpse of the city as far back as 1803 but of course the affects of 2 wars, especially the Vietnam War, are quite evident and humbling. Bullet holes can be seen in walls and buildings all over the properties. We were not overwhelmed by crowds of tourists and were not overly hassled but cyclos and peddlers like so many other tourist attractions. The Antiquities Museum was also included in our admission and was worth a tour too. Our favorite stop in Hue!"
"There are several gates for The Citadel but only one main entrance - it's a long way round if you don't get that right.

Although we didn't have bicycles, that looked like a nice way to get there and around.

There was a lot of scaffolding which is understandable as they are restoring this. It was a vast expanse of temples and nothingness.

The free video is worth watching.

You could spend an hour in the temple area or stay in the grounds for a few hours if you were so inclined.

In general, Hue was our least favourite of five stops in Vietnam so I can't really gush about anything."
"the noon gate is restored, I must visit Citadel in other gate. poor
I suggest visit minh mang tomb or thien mu pagoda, they're small but it's beautiful.... :)"
It's under renovation at the moment but still deserves a gander. Loved the urban planning of the place. The history behind it is a wild one at that. Must see when in Hue.
"Nice place so big though there is a lot to get round, best doing it on an average temperature day or else the sweat just lashes out off you."
Our trip here was rushed. We only had 3hrs to do a 6hr tour of the places we wanted to see due to weather. Wish we had longer.
We only went for 1 hour and without a guide. There is alot of restoration going on and what i saw of that looks impressive but it will be a while before any of the main parts are done. What there is to look at was nice and with the guide and abit of imagination could be alot better. Would recommend 2-3 hours with a guide.
"Amazing history. The original city had been severely bombed during the Vietnam War, so much of the original has disappeared. The main building was undergoing renovation during our visit. The showroom with the relic exhibits was fascinating. We did not have enough time to take it all in. You need about an hour to read the info and take in the displays."
"Much less remains than I expected, the wars took a high toll. And the landmark Morning Gate is currently beeing totally overhauled."
"Compared to the Imperial City in Beijing, Hue Imperial City is relatively small and run down. There were a lot of buildings under renovation. It might therefore look more impressive in the near few years. For the time being, I personally didn't find it interesting."
"This was one of the places my husband really wanted to see. Unfortunately, there was so much damage from the bombing that there is very little to see. They are working on restoring buildings but it will be a long time (if ever) at the rate they are going. What is there is interesting and with a little imagination after visiting the model of the entire property, one can try to glimpse the former glory that was once there. It's a shame that historical sites like this can't be off limits in war...wouldn't that be amazing."
"This is the greatest ancient architecture complex that is still maintained pretty well Vietnam after the war. The old city looks like a giant chessboard which includes 64 squares. The Imperial Citadel is quite large that you should spend at least 4-5 hours to visit. To observe beauty of buildings which is classical for national old style; to know history materials, real stories; and even to try clothes of king and queen will be memorable experience. The weather in summer may be quite hot for foreigners so you should come here in early morning."
Go early in the day as the citadel is very large and better to do before the real heat of the day arrives. It is sadly somewhat damaged after the American War when a lot of it was destroyed by bombs but a good guide can bring it to life again. This was the old capital for many years until the move to Hanoi. It has a charm of its own and a trip on the Perfume River is also a must.
"I have to agree with some of the other reviews here that the Imperial City has a long way to go before it is restored back to its original glory. We paid around $5 for entry. If you are in Hue, there's not a tremendous amount to do so it's worth coming here for sure. But manage your expectations, this is not an epic experience.

Parts of it are under renovation. The rest of it is interesting to see. For $5 per ticket plus the money it receives from other agencies/ countries for renovations, I was expected a bit more. Only half the gardens were well maintained, the rest of it is a bit feral.

Lastly, there was no toilet paper in the toilets. This seems petty, but again I wondered where all the ticket money went if not on the renovations or toilet paper. . . ."
"There are large swaths of the city that have been destroyed from the war but there are sections that have been restored that are beautiful. The main section when you walk in and towards the back is the most damaged, make sure to walk to the far Left side of the city to get a view of more of the reconstructed buildings."
"This place is in need of renovations, and that is very obvious. If you have a good imagination then this place is just what you need. The citadel is huge and you can easily get lost if you don't pay atention. They have some interesting features, like changing of the guards, rooms with pictures of the old emperors,... However with all the restarations currently going on you don't get the full picture of how it was."
"Although some renovations are being carried out, it is breath taking.Some damage as a result of the Vietnam war caused by America"
"The location was nice to visit, if you have been to Bejing and seen the forbidden city, you realise there is still a lot to repair before all can be shown how it was before. The video which they show in one of the buildings directly after the entrance gives a good impression how immens this city was. The theater room is a beautiful area. With the video in mind walking around the area already gives a good idea how they lived here many years ago. Definitely worth to visit."
"The citadel copped some serious damage in 1968, and still looks decrepit. It's a big place, so there's a lot of walking if you don't fancy the electric cars. As with the royal tombs outside town,it's not that spectacular. There's better pagodas elsewhere."
"Watch out here when you pay to get in! I had previously read to be careful when paying and check change etc and we got given the wrong change. When you question it she immediately gives you the correct change but that is not the point. Really disappointing from what is supposed to be one of Hue's best attractions.

Its expensive in comparison to other attractions in Vietnam, and not worth it. Very run down, the only good bit was the 5 minute tv video of how it is supposed to look. Areas have no paths, there are lots of scaffolding up etc very poorly maintained.

Wouldn't ever go back, expensive and they try to scam you!"
"The Imperial City is a very nice place and even if a lot is destroyed we enjoyed the peace (compared to the forbidden city in Beijing !!).

What we really didn't like is that the woman at the Entrance tried to scammed 50.000 Dongs from us. When she gave me the change money, she tried to hide one bill. When I told her that money was missing, she not even counted to know how much was missing, she knew it, so it proved that she tried to take this money on purpose !!"
"This May, I took my 2 friends to see the Citadel and boy it is so bad. It was a mess and is still a mess. France has donated ton of money to Vietnamese government to remodel this place and it has not improved in the past 10 years. What a shame!!!!

Donot waste your money and time to visit the Citadel!

Visit Minh Mang tomb or Tu Duc tomb or Thien Mu Pagoda or Cau Ngoi Thanh Toan(Thanh Toan covered brigde). The bridge is very unique and a MUST SEE."
"Badly damaged during the war but the restoration work is taking shape and you get an idea of the scale of the place.

They seem to have started at one end and be working there way back so by the time you pass through the first few buildings you have an idea from the foundations what the missing buildings would have looked like.

The photos showing the american tanks occupying the place give a bit of history about why its not in the best condition.

We had visited the forbidden city in Beijing the month before and its unfair to compare the two although similarities are striking. What i found most strange was the dates as with much of the historic monuments about Hue they are relatively modern. The Kings were building the Tombs and using the Imperial City while signing the country over to the french. Gives a different perspective on what was going on in the country in the lead up to the independence movement and Ho Chi Minhs rise to prominance."
"An extremely interesting historical site. Undergoing some restoration, but you can still spend hours wandering through this fascinating place - gives a great insight into the imperial history of the region. It is a UNESCO site & suffered major damage during the Vietnam war, but the restoration is bringing life back to the remaining temples & buildings. We spent quite a few hours here & thoroughly enjoyed it."
"This site is just amazing! So much to see and contemplate!
We spent 2 days there as 1 day is definitely not enough!
This is worth traveling to Hué just to see that!"
"This is a must-see in Hue, the ancient palace and citadel are very interested and aesthetically pleasing too. My trip was a little disrupted by rain, but I am still very happy I went there. A nice way to look into the history of Central Vietnam."
Lose yourself in Hue Imperial City. Wander for hours and hours in the Imperial City and it's beautiful architecture and history. So much restoration is currently underway which will add to this marvellous site. As there is so much to see here leave yourself hours to enjoy it all.
"No matter what the historical contribution of it to the city of Hue and Vietnam overall, the citadel is mainly under renovation and most of its buildings are covered in scaffoldings.

Though it was interesting, I felt that I would be better have visited Hue in a few years."
"Vietnam's last feudal capital - a magnificent architecture of pagodas, tombs laid out in small villages and hills. Amazing history of this massive citadel contains the Imperial city and Purple forbidden city."
"The updated entrance fee is 105,000VND which we thought was a little steep. We were glad we went to the Citadel as there is such history at the ruins, however it seemed a little abandoned and in need of attention. Also, some more signage etc. would be good as we didn't want to hire a guide but at times felt like we were going round in circles. Theres potential there, but it needs some work. I still don't think you can leave Hue without the experience."
"I went there with my family and have enjoyed the walk around the ruins. It was so huge. The walk was enjoyable. There were some informations on all the different emperors in english. But other than that, I didnt see any english written information.

like visiting angkor wat, I think it would have been better if you go with a tour guide. Then you get alot more from your visit."
"This is definitely one of the gems of Vietnam and we spent a long day wandering about the ruins and reconstructions of Hue’s old imperial city. It was quite expensive (relative to Vietnam), around 150,000 dong but we did have an entire city to explore. The restorations and reconstructions are brilliantly done and there are plenty of signs in English letting you know what each area was for and how it would have been used during the height of Imperial power.
Not only this, but there were informative movies in some of the buildings and we got a real sense of the history and purpose of the place. As with almost every historical place in Vietnam there has to be some connection to the war and this was no different. There was a section on the damage wrought during the war and what had happened since.
Needless to say, it looks a lot better than it did back then but there are still plenty of ruins around for those who want to explore some old tumbledown palaces as well! We had a lot of fun and felt much like explorers."
"This is a large complex of ornate buildings from the first half of the nineteenth century, in a spacious layout inside a formidable wall. Parts of it were badly damaged in the Vietnam war and are being restored. The scale is impressive, the individual buildings are beautiful and the complex, which includes a library and a theatre as well as palaces, memorial pavilions and shrines, evokes the grand life of the imperial dynasty. You see costumes worn by the court, documents submitted for their approval and the seals used by successive emperors to sign them off. We thought it fully deserved its World Heritage Site status and really enjoyed our long morning wandering around it."
"Visited the Citadel, and happy to see the history of golden days. Spread in vast area with many places of interest I found it is a good place in Vietnam to see."
"Modeled after the Forbidden City in Beijing China, this Forbidden seems just a little smaller in size no less stunning. The grandeur and luxury in which the royals once lived is amazing. The palace grounds are well kept and very clean as well as well manicured.I have been here before and if I remember correctly the entry price has about doubled, though still not very unreasonable. Some parts are still being repaired and reconditioned. Still a good place to spend a few hours to absorb so of the local culture."
"A World Heritage Site ( UNESCO ) The Imperial City in Huế is a walled fortress and palace in the former capital of Vietnam. It is pretty impressive in size and you would really need half a day to take a leisurely walk around. We opted for a combined tour the Citadel ( Imperial City ) and the Khai Dinh Tomb as we were short of time. We booked this through our hotel - private car for 2 no time limit for 500,000 dong ( roughly £15) Entry to the City is paid at the gate and is 105,000 dong ( just under £3 ) It closes at 5 pm. You could probably find a tour cheaper at one of the tour shops on the street if so inclined. A lot of the Citadel was destroyed in the war and is being renovated having said that it is still a very impressive attraction, with lots to see. A large grounds surrounded by a wall with smaller gardens inside and interesting buildings and structures. You can see some of the original walls, interesting architectural gates to exit, if you are visiting Hue and you do not go to see this you are a fool. Steeped in History the Citadel was a forbidden city where only the emperors, concubines, and those close enough to them were granted access. The Citadel is flat and so would enable wheelchair access. We did not see a shop or toilet facilities but we only did a fraction of the Citadel due to time."
"Amazing place to visit.
Good to see that it is being refurbished.
We visited the citadel by private car after being stalked and harassed by a cyclo driver the previous day.
Ripped off by the lady selling entrance ticket by 500.000 dong !"
"We had too much proud to pay the entrace fee. The price for a local was cheaper. We can understand it, but we don't like. One for all, all for one."
"The citadel has some pretty buildings, but much of the few standing buildings had to be remade after the war damage. Plus, with the 110,000 dong price tag (double a year ago), it's a bit steep for what it is.

If you are on a budget, save your cash. If not, it makes for a pleasant way to spend an afternoon in Hue. But your money would probably be better spent on one of the tombs (80,000 dong)."
"The citadel was very interesting, and amazing that it was in use not all that long ago! It is a shame that the wars have made some of it ruined but the work being undertaken to restore it is really good. Walking inside you can really picture it when in use by the Emperors. You definitely should visit!"
"Hue Citadel is definately worth a visit if you are staying in Hue or are just visiting for the day as this is the main attraction in this area. The size of the Citadel itself is pretty impressive but once inside theres not a massive amount to see if you're after the old building as most of the Citadel was destroyed in both the second world war and then the Vietnam war but there is a lot of restoration work going on aswel.

Having said it is still definately worth a visit and there are a couple of museums inside so you can still keep yourself occupied whilst here."
We spent the best part of an afternoon wandering around The Citadel despite the rain and it was fantastic. It's great to see so much work going into the restoration efforts.
Fantastic history and very well preserved. You should have a guide to detail the background history of this amazing Citadrl
"Our tour group visits the ancient citadel (the Peaceful Palace) which is lovely. Much of it is a mix of ancient ruins and accurate recreations as funding is slowly acquired to fix the massive damage caused during the Vietnam War.

Despite being the City of Rain it is hot, dry, and sunny. Our tour leader advises we're in the 30-40'C range today. Buying water as we go is definitely a necessity (and it can be purchased at the Citadel)."
We walked around for about 4 hours I loved this place. They still have a lot of work rebuilding but what has been done is great. There are so many old photos and so much information.
"Visiting The Citadel is visiting Vietnam's past of splendour, colonial exploitation, destruction, wonton violence, rebuilding followed by destruction in the not so distant past. Hue taken by the Vietcong and than bombed to rubble by the Americans (Hue has to be destroyed to save it was the American Pilosophy) than re-taken by the Americans before being liberated one more by the communist forces! Today a lot has been re-built with the help of the United Nations. A splendid site. We spent the whole day there."
"We visited the Citadel (over the River) which was the ancient capital of Vietnam. The Citadel was destroyed in fighting during the Vietnam War.
One of the bridges across to the Citadel looked like the Forth Bridge, Scotland!
We had tea and Green Beans with some Vietnamese ladies who picked the beans in the field and cooked then straight away."
"The Imperial Citadel is truly beautiful and peaceful. It has extensive grounds in a 3 kilometer square area with many special buildings, including a palace for the King's mother, housing for his many concubines, and a private theatre for him and his court. As a matter of national pride, the last King refused to allow the French Governor to enter through the main gate reserved for the King. That was about the only power he had left!"
"Huế is the former capital of Vietnam with the seat of power in the Imperial City (The Citadel).

The Imperial City is a walled fortress and palace surrounded by a wall 2 kilometers by 2 kilometers, and a moat that has water taken from the Huong River (Perfume River) that flows through Huế.

Inside the Imperial City was the imperial enclosure called the Purple Forbidden City which was reserved for the Nguyễn imperial family with the rule of the last Vietnamese Emperor ending as recently as the mid-1900s.
The Emperor had something like 1,000 wives so that’s why you’ll see the surname Nguyễn all over the place.
It’s kinda like the Vietnamese “Smith” as a surname.

Building on this site began in 1804.
Thousands of workers built a wall and dug a 10 kilometer long moat. Initially the walls were earthen, but these were replaced by stone walls 2 metres thick.

In the American War's Battle of Hue, due to its religious and cultural status, Allied forces were ordered not to bomb or shell the city; but as casualties mounted in house-to-house fighting these restrictions were lifted and fighting caused substantial damage and you can still see bullet holes in the stone work.

The buildings that still remain are being restored and preserved, but it’s a BIG job and still a lot of work to do.
This is very much a work in progress..

Overall the Citadel is huge and amazing.
It’s not at all difficult to imagine the opulence of this place when it was at its finest and it is well worth a few of hours of your time to wander around and take this place in."
probably worth an hour or so but lot of it was being worked on. Main room was good but needed a little tlc. Dusty and lacking sparkle. Also needs better signage and explanations
"Really enjoyed this visit, lots to see, and plenty of history to absorb. Loved the large urns made from old munitions, the gardens, there is lots of reconstruction going on, but still many beautiful things to see and absorb."
"We had a nice wander around the Citadel, exploring the various buildings and marvelling at the impressive architecture and lavish decoration inside the palaces and temples. Once some of the restoration work has been finished it will be even more impressive - the war damage is tragic really. A better map for visitors than the tiny one on the back of the ticket would be helpful, and it would also be good if you could buy a ticket just for the Citadel and not one that combined the Citadel and the Antiquities Museum, which we didn't really want to see. We paid 105,000 dong each for the combined ticket (we were told the previous day that the museum was 40,000 dong)."
"This place is massive, but a lot of the buildings are damaged or just not there due to bombings in the Vietnam war, its such a pity so much as ben damaged. There are projects on the go restoring whats still standing back to its former glory and in time the missing buildings will be rebuilt. Gardens need a bit more care but all in all it was interesting to walk around the once royal palace grounds. The last Emperor died in 1997 but relinquished his throne back in 1945."
"I loved visiting the citadel. The architecture is amazing and I could have wandered around all day. You need a whole afternoon to explore and enjoy everything, but it is worth the trip to Hue just to see this."
"Its OK if you want to waste a few hours but there is not much to see or do here. Also, we were constantly tormented with people asking us if we wanted to hire bikes, constantly.. Following us everywhere."
A great guide took us around this great place. We only spent 2 hours here but I would like to have spent the whole day. Do your homework first and the visit will be all the more fascinating.
"We stayed in Vietnam for nearly 4 weeks and this was our poorest city experience. In fact, we would cut Hue out of a future itinery altogether. OK, it's got historical relevance and certainly the lack of investment in the maintenance of the Citadel site allows you to see the impact of the wars in vivid, raw state before your own eyes.

But it's not encapsulating. We had better experiences all across Vietnam. Hue needs some seriously better transport links to allow a quick stop off rather than a concerted detour on a trip. I would rather have spent my time elsewhere."
This place has been attacked and bombed by successive invading forces and bears too many scars - it's been pretty well devastated in many areas. The scale and concept is unbelievable and it's a huge shame (a crime really) that more hasn't been left intact. It's hard to se how a country with the resources of Vietnam wil ever get the restoration works to any meaningful level.
"This is what a lot of people come to see in Hue, a main attraction, however, our experience there was interesting, but no more than we had expected. The work that has gone into this place is phenomenal, especially after being bombed by American troops in the war."
"I visited by ourselves. A luxurious place. The first time I discovered this heritage land. I visited Dong Ba market. Tu Duc tomb, Khai Dinh tomb and Thien Mu Pagoda"
"We had a lovely walk around the citadel wall, however at each of the four entrances we failed to be able to gain entry into the citadel so cannot comment on within the wall but do think that the signs could be improved. We did manage to speak to a guard that spoke some english who told us it was just around the corner in one direction and then pointed another group of tourists in the other direction and told them entry was 110,000vnd much higher than we had read so decided to leave this attraction as a nice place to walk around the outside of..."
"A new place to see, new historical facts. much to see and reasonable friendly people. Not that expensive for Hotel and food"
We had a lovely time walking around here. Very interesting with a local guide and very nice to see the renovations in the Forbidden Purple City. It will be amazing when it is finished.Many many photo opportunities
"There is potential for a great place in the future here, but as for now it is mostly under construction and there is not upkeep of the grounds at all. It was more sad than anything to see such a historic place not well taken care of. Looks like they have future plans with it so hopefully things change."
"Quite an impressive structure to see, but we didnt spend very long here (1.5-2 hours) as there wasnt alot of information available. Maybe we needed a good guide?"
"Well worth a visit, pity the Americans tried to bomb it into the dark ages. Work being carried out to restore many of the damaged buildings"
"What a great experience this was,it took us a whole day to explore and we were'nt disappointed.
The buildings were full of history and the grounds were beautiful."
Sadly recent 20th Century conflicts have destroyed or damaged the bulk of this significant historic land mark. However great efforts are being made to restore the citadel and a visit is well worth while. A guide is affordable and a great help to make sense of this site.
"In many ways similar but also different in many ways to its counterpart in Beijing.
Beautiful gardens, a place you can easily spend a half day at."
"This was part of our 3 for 1 ticket in Hue. We entered the walled city through a huge gate with only one guard processing tickets. That was needlessly slow. The gate itself was very nice and was being restored while we were there. Inside the walled city the area is very open and It makes you wonder how many buildings have been destroyed and removed. We did the circuit and that took a while and we went to exit through the gate we came in. Despite the gate being huge, you can't do that. You have to walk all the way around to a side gate which would be more than a kilometer away. Give yourself a bit more than an hour as it is a long walk to see everything and you can get dressed up in old Vietnamese dress and have your picture taken"
"Talk about excess, this place does it. It is a mini trip to China, with all the mandarin excess and pomp right here in Hue. It is impressive, a must see, and ultimately reminds one of how kings and aristocracy are deservedly things of the past....but the buildings are way cool."
There is nothing to see at the Citadel. The entire back of the Imperial city was damaged after the war and cannot be fixed. There is only one building that you can get in to see the King and Queen dresses. But this room is so hot that I cannot stand in there for long.
"Restoration has been going on for many years, they are doing an excellent job, worth a visit. Loved the history did not dislike anything"
Don't just confine your visit to the completed buildings. The rest of the complex is worth a view. The ticket gets you into other sites in Hue.
"Hue Citadel is a vast and elegant complex. Imperial City is the best part of Hue Citadel. It was very beautiful and interesting, Cost 105000VND to get in and worth every VND. it could be wonderful if it possible to visit it at night."
"The devastation caused by the American bombing left this once majestic site a virtual ruin. Many buildings are simply gone, others are still in a state of destruction... to see the glorious history of a nation destroyed affected me strongly. Never again will this world likely see a country build such a place as this again, the world has simply moved on, and it is a terrible shame.

I have been to the Forbidden City in Beijing and could close my eyes and picture the absent buildings in my mind, but then when I opened them, there was an empty field confronting me, sometimes with the outline of building foundations, sometimes with just steps leading to the rise upon which once sat a grand, important, ornate structure.

There is some restoration as well as rebuilding in progress, but I personally would prefer no more to be done; the desolate, ruinous state tells a story that needs to be told, that great cultural accomplishments and history itself can be wiped out swiftly by the hand of men.

I rated this 5 stars not for what I saw, but for what was. Luckily, to the south of the complex, many buildings survived the war, but the central and most important part took the brunt of it all."
Less crowded than I expected but well with a visit. Really interesting seeing the restoration masters at work
"When we visited the citadelle, we were disappointed. In comparison to the tombs around the city, the citadelle is boring, the builldings are nothing special and sometimes not even restaurated. On top of that, they prepared the area for a festival, so that the buildings were hidden behind kitschy decoration.
But (!) there is one thing worth seing in there: the great wall around the area. It gives the impression of being in a big fortress, which gives you the feeling of wandering through a real patriarchal place.

Recommendable, when you have the combo-ticket (from the tombs), otherwise it depends on your priorities."
"This is quiet a large complex with many different buildings -if you dont feel like walking there are electric cars that take you around but we enjoyed the walk despite the rain.

There is a digital reconstruction history video that lasts about 5 minutes that is very good and helpful.

Some of the buildings are under renovation

Cost of entry $10 each"
"The entrance does not prepare you for what's inside. Once you stepped through, you find yourself transported into another era. Strolling through the complex is amazing, with it's well preserved building and the tranquil feeling is awesome!"
"As a Vietnamese, I loved our my country's history and Hue was the best among the best to know about Vietnam history.
Upon arrival at Hue Imperial City, I felt like living in the old time, when the King was still existed. I was so excited.
My family went with a tour guide and thanks to him, we had a chance to get clearly our history.
The structure was in well maintenance. This place owned Vietnamese ancient architecture.
We loved Vietnam and we loved this place."
We visited The Citadel as part of a cycle tour around Hue. It was a beautiful day for walking around and our guide provided enough information for us to gain an understanding of what life was like for the Emperors. Definitely worth a visit
"The Citadel is a must when visiting Vietnam, specially if you would like to understand the history of the country. We had an exceptional young guide for our tour who was extremely knowledgeable and explained everything in detail. The grounds were well looked after and very clean and the flowers exquisite. Definitely a highlight of our tour of Vietnam."
Hue Citadel is a vast and elegant complex. You will need more than 3 hours to explore the sight. At the heart of the complex is the Imperial City. Imperial City is the best part of Hue Citadel. Extensive restoration work has undergone which gave us an idea of this former glory.
"Me and my partner decided to go to Hue after hearing about how romantic it was. We got there and the citadel was covered in scaffolding and building work, I couldn't believe they were charging people to get in still! It took us ages to find anything, we were told a show was on in the royal theater at half 3 so we rushed to find it only to see people rehearsing a show instead. There were a few nice parts that weren't being demolished or rebuilt but if your going to visit I recommend hiring a guide.

Unfortunately the citadel is in bad shape from the terrorist attack in the 60s, although parts of it are still pretty. I just wish we had been told most of it was under scaffolding before we went in, but instead we were just charged normal price. It's just a huge tourist attraction, which I tried to stay away from during my visit to Vietnam and had much more enjoyment visiting the tombs in Hue instead. Now they were beautiful to walk around.

What annoyed me was no one said we couldn't get out the way we came in after 5pm. This place is huge and there are only 4 ways in so we had to walk far just to try and get out.

The citadel is somewhere to visit once, I would not go there again."
"If you are going to Vietnam, I think you have to see The Citadel to appreciate the history of the country"
"Nothing to tell about negatives things, I loved this spot and they are working hardly to conserve it. It need time because it's huge,

There are many many "" lake"" with flower, wow. Breathtaking"
"It was very beautiful and interesting, has a great informative video you can watch and not need a tour guide but very dry and hot make sure you take a hat and sunblock!"
"The buildings which have been renovated are beautiful and well worth a visit. It's just a shame that in the Vietnamese war so much damage was done. I've visited the forbidden city in Beijing and I think this one is far more beautiful, colourful, and interesting and the sky is clear so you get great views around the area. Once all the work has been completed it will be even more impressive. I would recommend you do this while in Hue."
"Well worth a visit, take a leisurely stroll inside and take in the architecture of old Vietnam and the peace and quiet this walled city offers."
"It was a huge place and we visited just this morning and we paid 105,000 VND. It was worthy, we enjoyed roaming around and reminiscing the history of the place."
"This tourist attraction was worth the visit. Take a tuk-tuk from your hotel, but go early in the morning to fit it all in; it is a huge complex and lots to see."
I did this as part of a day tour which was ok but it is just as easy to go there under your own steam. The guide was quite good and it was good to have some back ground as The Lonely Planet had very little info.There is a lot of renovation work being done but still quite a lot to see.
"One of the must see attractions in Hue. The shear size of this place is amazing and contains so much history about Vietnam. Cost 105000VND to get in and worth every VND. Great video that recreates the Citadel in all it glory and really shows the Chinese influence in this part of Vietnam. Try and get there early to miss the crowds and get some better photos of the buildings without huge crowds standing in front and also the afternoon heat can be quite confronting in Hue and the majority of this attraction you will be walking around the grounds outside.

If u don't want to walk the massive grounds you can always hire a golf cart with a driver to take you around.

Much of it is still under reconstruction but you will still spend a great deal of time here to see what is currently available for the tourists."
"Excellent knowledgable guide to show us this attraction. Fascinating to see and to see the possibilities of restoration, which we hope gets complete one day."
The Imperial City is absolutely fantastic. The temples and the palace are very interesting - probably my highlight of a 2 week tour of Vietnam. Visit early to avoid the larger crowds and the heat.
The Imperial City (citadel) is just a beautiful old ruins. Takes a bit to walk round while you think about what life was like back then. The colors of red & yellow just add to this imperial city. A must see when in Hue
"This feels like a very sleepy, slow paced exhibit of the Citadel. There isn't very much information to read and the presentation on the tv is the only real insight you get of the Citadel. I think in the future once all the restorative work is done perhaps they will open up more for the public."
"Certainly quite disappointing next to the 'real' Forbidden city in China. Nice gardens, but overall this wasn't so impressive - lots of restoration needed, some seems to be in progress. Expensive to visit compared to many other Vietnamese sites."
"it was so warm.
if it is sunny when you decide to go, do not forget to take a hat and water!!
it takes about 2 hours to visit all the places"
"Interesting, but could be 10 time better. The sort of thing that if it was in the UK, would be a major tourist attraction, and cost a fortune to get in, but in Vietnam, you can just wander around as you please."
"Beautifull and ragtag at the same time. Everything that still stands or is restored is very nice to see on this enormous complex. In trueVietnamese tradition the same complex is littered with restoration works, holes in the ground, missing steps and whatnot. In all honesty, this only adds to the charm."
"The citadel is very splendid but also quite spread out, with reasonably long walks between the individual buildings. If you can deal with half a day walking it's better to see everything in a leisurely fashion. That way you can systematically ensure that you don't miss anything (I found the signage and directions rather inadequate). Everything is a little quaint and kitsch compared to the Beijing Imperial Palace on which it's modelled, but the faded gaudiness of it all will appeal strongly to anyone who enjoys ornamentation done to excess."
A colourful little place that is well worth a visit if in Hue. The sights are really worth spending a morning having a look. Electric buses are also there if you have any problems with walking as it does take a fare while to look around. Great photo opportunity.
"This is a nice place to visit and partially it is still original.
Main walls are still original but unfortunately they are undertaking major ""restauration"" (= rebuilding and overpainting!) to many walls and buildings.

IMPORTANT:
Bring some water with you as there is one and only ""coffe bar"" inside and it is a complete rip-off"
I really enjoyed seeing the citadel as it is currently and visualizing how it will be when restored. It is impressive in its 'tired 'state and will be marvellous when the work is eventually finished
"It cost about 105,000 dong each to go in and there was alot of work being done at the time, it was still ruins when we went and not as pretty as other places to see in vietnam but if you are in Hue you might as well go and see it. There was an informative video in the beginning but the complex alot smaller than you would think."
we have been here for 2 hours exploring around and found it's amazing place. it could be wonderful if it possible to visit it at night.
Certain parts are in ruins but the front are slowly being restored. It's pretty impressive even though it's old and badly maintained. The need for a good guide is recommended to visit the place
"This entire compound of this place is huge but only some buildings are worth visiting while others are closed to public or just very empty. It would be more interesting if there was more information or things to see other than just buildings. Maybe getting a guide is a good idea.
There are a few residences which has old rock gardens but are not maintained well. Restoration works is underway at some areas, but not much information about the work. Some illustrations would make it more interesting, like if there was an illustration of the Emperor's residence at the compound. Without this some areas looked like empty fields.
The ticket price includes the museum on the outside of the compound. There is free tram car ride on the eastern gate straight to the museum, which was interesting. This museum is very near the eastern bridge over the moat."
"The Inperial city, forbidden purple city and citadel unfortunately really are just a bunch of ruins in the middle of Hue. And even as ruins go, they're not very interesting. This isn't because it's not a fascinating sight, it's because there is very little tour infrastructure in place and you basically stumble your own way through it. The front gate and first hall have been restored and you can see that If it keeps going it WILL be amazing but it's up to you. It looked like a very run down version of the Forbidden city in Beijing and you can see the Chinese influence. If you want to go to say you've been BEFORE it was all restored (assuming they ever finish) then go, but if you missed it now it wouldn't ruin your life:)"
"Take a local private car and share the price, the driver know good places for lunch as well. A good Car service is from Vina Hotel Hue"
"Whilst it was badly damaged during the American war it is being carefully restored in places. However, its a very long term project. A guide is essential to allow you to understand the workings of the Imperial City."
"I visited here 10 years ago and wanted to visit again to show my other half. To my amazement the place was deserted and was able to get some wonderful photos with nobody in them. This place is stunning by any meaning of the word but when empty it was majestic with the only sound being the wildlife in the grass.
They are rebuilding the city as it was before the war and I have to say that the level of reconstruction is exceptional. The builders doing this really know their stuff and I am extremely impressed as the work done so far! Such a refreshing change."
"Liked: Impressive main palace
Disliked: very little information on site unless you have a tour guide. I'd recommend bringing a good guide book."
"Great day, sad to see what war does to such wonderful places, being rebuild . My advice is to go early as itdoes get warm walking in the middle of the day."
"Not a lot of information Signe in english. Makes it harder to understand the history behind. Expensive, but cheap food and drinks inside.

You should also think about taking a bicycle taxi around the the outside of the imperial city. But be aware, dont get ripped off! We where tolv by the taxi driver it was 250 000. When the trip was over, he suddenly said it was 250 000 per person in one taxi! We didnt pay more that 350 000 to the guy, but he was not a nice guy. So ask if it is a price for both of you."
"To listen to our tour guide, you'd have thought the citadel was a bombed out ruin. As we had some spare time, we thought we'd go along anyway, and thank goodness we did. really impressive site ... huge in it's scale, much of it restored beautifully. Spent a very pleasant couple of hours wandering around. Very tranquil and beautiful space in the middle of the city. A must visit."
it was huge palace but lack of maintaince. some parts were in ruins and the government is trying to restore
"I woke up early to avoid the crowds and was very excited to visit ancient citadel. It began poorly when I approached the gate to buy a ticket. The scam works this way:

Entry Fee is 105 VND.

The 100,000 and 10,000 look very similar. The lady has a 10,000 Dong note sitting on her lap. When you hand over the 100,000 and look down to pull out a 5,000 dong she switches the notes and holds up a 10,000 dong note and says you only gave me a 10,000 dong note.

Out the corner of my eye I saw her do it so when I said ""no no, you cheat me"" she says no, and says you only gave me 10,000. As a tourist, what can you do??? I argued with her till eventually I just had to walk away and give an extra 100,000.

I'd just arrived from Hoi An where I didnt feel like I was being scammed at all but in Hue, there has been a number of occasions where I feel scammed. Make sure you have your wits about you!

Apart from that the citadel is kind of boring and the free shuttle to the museum is free but they don't allow you to get back on and go back to the citadel for some reason event though the shuttle bus goes back there anyway!!!!

I asked if I could due to it raining but the driver said no.......shuttle is only one way. Clearly unable to think logically or rationally!!! Very daft if you ask me and not very tourist friendly...."
"Shame work was being done to the main entrance to the Citadel but beyond that are some lovely places to explore - you can easily spend a large part of the day here with some many ruins and buildings to visit - go to the theatre and watch the traditional dancing.

Beware it's a little more costly by Vietnamese standards to enter and for the music/dancing show"
"I think we just expected more. Costs 105,000 VND to get in... The few buildings that have been restored look nice but there is scaffolding everywhere so it really ruins the aesthetic appeal. The history is the main reason anyone should visit, very eerie to be around lots of bombed buildings."
"I always love the Citadel. The main gate is being repaired at the moment so we couldn't go up. Some pavilions are almost finished with the reconstruction. Can't wait to go back next year to see how much they have done. Way to go UNESCO, I must remember to donate towards the repair and rebuit of the Hue Citadel."
Allow at least 3-4 hours for a thorough look. Picturesque and very photgenic. I could have stayed for hours. Took a horse and buggy. the driver was very freindly and seemed to treat the horse well. It was extremely hot (35C)
"The place was sorely lacking in interpretive info, so read up before you go, or hire a guide. Bicycling around the moat is not a bad idea, especially if you stop in at Tofu and enjoy a tofu yogurt shake. Creamy and yummy!"
"Easy to walk around on your own. Interesting places to explore, not much restrictions within the premises to hinder your viewing of each and every structure.
Unfortunately, a lot of the places are still under restorations due to damages from war."
"The size of this city is impressive! We were able to tour through part of the well-kept grounds, but made the mistake of arriving midday in July, so we didn't see it all. The varied history described and showed were quite interesting."
We came to Hue to see the empirial palace and learn the history. It's been a bit disappointing. We probably should of come with a guide. It just seems like this is important enough to have a world heritage listing and yet there is no signs or maps or even staff anywhere to show you around. Another poorly organised sight in vietnam. It could be done so much better.
"We went to Hue to see the citadel and didn't get disapointed!
You get many aspects of the Vietnamese history here. First there are all the buildings of the citadel. Next you get a feeling of how much that has been destroyed (and not yet rebuild) during the different periods of hard times of the country."
We really enjoyed our day at the Imperial City. It was interesting to see the process of rebuilding a site once completely destroyed by wars.
"The Citadel has a very long imperial and sad recent history. It was at the centre of one of the longest fighting during the 1998 Tet offensive. Many lives were lost and great damage to historical sites occurred. The site has been restored to its old splendour (still on-going, due to the extensive damage done) and is very worth visiting"
"The citadel was badly damaged during numerous wars, but they have been busy rebuilding it. As soon as you walk through the massive wall on the outside, you are instantly transported back in time. You can imagine the emperor and staff going about their business. As I said a lot of buildings had been destroyed, but there are still enough to let you understand the massiveness as well as the luxory of the place. Its worth getting a tour guide to help you understand everything.
They have a cafe that is over priced on the grounds. Also there is an elephant you can ride though we did not think he looked that healthy.
You can read more about it in my blog at http://michaelbencik.org/2013/08/02/hues-forbidden-city/"
"We visited the citidel with a tour guide who gave us the background knowledge and history. Most of the buildings were destroyed during the French invasion and subsequent wars, but is slowly being restored. It is mind blowing that you are actually walking in the home of emporers, their work areas, homes of their concubines etc. definitely worth spending a few hours just wandering around taking everything in."
"Get to see the brilliant architecture and design, and to know the history behind...
Thanks to the tour guide for giving us the info and linking it together for us to see the whole picture..."
"This was badly damaged after various wars, but its still worth a look. The area is huge.

The few rooms that still remain and are open to the public are impressive, and you gain an insight into what emporers really meant to society when they were in power.

Little things like the way the throne lines up directly with the giant flagpole all the way outside are the most impressive, because they are intricately thought out in the planning process and all have a spiritual significance.

The furniture itself is interesting to see, and its crazy to think you are looking at things that belonged to a king.

Learning about the ways of life lead by king and other royals is so interesting, and at times, hard to believe, but I cant imagine a trip to Hue without going here."
"Even with a really bad weather i spent few hours inside citadel, when i went there were many works around anyway is impossible to visit Hue missing citadel"
"Largely destroyed during the French reoccupation in 1957, it is now being slowly restored with assistance from several overseas countries.
if you are interested in Vietnamese history this is very worthwhile, if not you will likely find it a bit dull to visit."
it was amazing and is worth the few hours it needs to be fully seen. we went on a not-too-hot day and walking under the trees completed the experience
"Whilst we appreciated the history of the site & the fact that restoration is underway, I was a bit disappointed that for what ever reason it hasn't been a high priority or at least it doesn't seem to be. The video explaining it's history is worth watching."
"This is a vast complex and you need to allow a couple of hours to explore the entire thing. We were there on one of the hottest days of the year, and there aren't many cool places so we had to cut it short. They are rebuilding parts of the city that have been restored, so some areas were off limits - but the grounds were amazing. There's a place inside where you can ""dress up"" and take photos, for a nominal fee of course. It was thoroughly enjoyable but, like I said, we needed more time or a cooler day."
"sadly there isn't as much to see now because of the bombs and wars. but of what there is its beautiful. some parts under construction. the theatre is gorgeous. I Highly recommend a guide tho, just to put pictures into your head. fee for foreigners 105,000 dong.be careful with benders they re shifty. Will try sell 3 times amount for water!pay 8-10,000 for small water 10-15,000 for large. no more. the one thing I hate about Vietnam is the local price and the foreigner price!!"
The Citadel is huge and amazing. It is well worth a couple of hours of your time to wander around and take this place in.
"The citadel was okay, if you want to experience the old part of the city and the big flag tower than its great. It was such a shame seeing all the bullet marks on the city walls. Watch out for the scammers and dont pay more than 20000d for water inside the citadel. tip, you can only enter from the front, they dont allow entry at the back of the citadel unless you have already bought a ticket."
"Hyped up as one of Vietnam's main attractions. It's worth a visit, but not a roundtrip to Hue. Sights outside the city are much more appealing. Still interesting in a 'fallen glory'-kind of way. Besides the two main courtyards, the place is falling apart and swarming with Chinese tourist groups."
"Impressive site, a must see. Restoration works ongoing, and leading to excellent results, as the team that did this took painstaking effort to redo the place in ts original splendour, based on old materials and techniques."
"expected too much then disappointrd too much.
besides the walls surrounded ,you cant find any trace of the place king live before but just a chair and
abandon garden."
"This was just beautiful, excellent and amazing. We walked around the whole area, and even though the reconstruction was underway a lot was already done. Very pretty - absolut must see!!"
"While the Citadel has a wealth of history to it, we felt that very little information was provided to visitors, and we ended up researching it online later. It is very run-down (naturally), however, it would be great to have information placards explaining the role of the citadel in the war with America and before. Worth a trip, but bring a guide book!"
"Hue Imperial City is very attractive to discover. Its beautiful ancient construction and peaceful atmosphere can give you some special feeling. But I suggest that you should come there with an experienced tour guide to understand as much as possible about Vietnam' history-culture and Nguyen dynasty (the last dynasty of Vetnam) and have full vision about this place. In my opinion, It's very difficult to perceive the real value of one cultural relic by yourself even reading a lot about them.
This place is very large so a full day maybe enough for visiting."
"Tip: If you plan to visit the Khai Dinh, Minh Mang tombs and Citadel you should consider the combined ticket which costs 180 000. Individually it would cost you 265 000 but including also the museum ( I don't think it is worth it, check my review).

Tip: an umbrella will be useful and lots of water.

The Citadel is a must see. If you don't have enough time to enroll a tour and visit the tombs you can go to the Citadel independently. It's close to the city center. And it's really beautiful. In the tour we have aprox. 1h to visit it which is not enough if you want to see every detail."
"our tour guide drove us nuts with detail, we were fainting from the heat, everything is spread out dramatically... I just didn't enjoy this site, I've traveled to many temples, and important monuments in 35 countries and we hired a little like golf cart vehicle to take us around and it was $ 10 each. Not interesting to me, and we traveled a long way 3.5 hours each direction to spend time in Hue, just to end up enjoying two restaurants. The Pagoda and the Ditadel just were not what I expected I guess."
"We visited this site as part of a scooter tour of Hue, and were dropped off at the front entrance to make or way around. We didn't have a guide, and we probably should have, as the site it vast, with I many different buildings, with so many different dynasties, that it would have been nice to have known more about the history.

It's quite expensive by Vietnamese standards to enter, (105,000 VND), but you could easily spend a whole day walking round. Make sure you take sunscreen, a hat, and plenty of water though, as there's very little shade.

As I have mobility problems we opted instead of walking to do the electric car trip in addition, (also very expensive at 80,000 VDN) for 30 minutes. We were told by our scooter guide to ask for this at the entrance when we bought our ticket, but they didn't have a clue what we were talking about! It wasn't until we entered the site, saw a cart with a driver, and stopped him that we even knew that they actually did exist! There was a bit of confusion as to payment as the driver didn't speak English, (they're not guides), but all became clear when we arrived at the car station, and were issued with a receipt. I'm so glad that we got the car, because without it, and the walking distance I would have been in trouble.

The buildings and the grounds were beautiful, but because we only had a 30 minute car trip, we were straight in and out, and missed out on most of the buildings. There were also steps into all of the buildings, as you would expect. It was enough to get a small glimpse though, but I would recommend staying longer."
"The Citadel is badly signposted, not clear where you enter or where you get the ticket. Inside there is very little information about which building is which. Would be better if there was a suggested route to walk around. The buildings are not very old and not very impressive and poorly maintained. The video on the TV in one building gave us a better idea. The drinks and icecreams inside were very expensive. It was very very hot and a bit boring, especially for the kids. Hue seems to be on every major Vietnam tour itinerary but unless you love ruins I might give it a miss."
Definitely worth a visit if you are in Hue. Interesting buildings and history but the signage isn't great so if you are not going with an experienced guide it would be worthwhile to do some reading before your visit.
Was very nice to visit despite the heat.... some places still under renovation but you can imagine the splendor
"We were picked up by a man named Xuan on his cyclo, he offered to take us around the citadel and see all of the sites, he waited for us at the different sites and explained what each place was. He was willing to sha his local knowledge and we were able to see a variety of sites during the afternoon, he even took the time to teach us some words and phrases in vietnamese. The citadel is a beautiful place with lots of history, a great way to spend the afternoon. Lots to look at and explore."
"You can't buy tickets on the gate here and we walked the wrong way round to find this out. It was actually nice and peaceful. An hour without scooters beeping horns. We got in and found where we should have started, initially it is nice and impressive, as you walk further down it is all ruins. I didn't realise this. It is nice to see though"
"The Imperial City is, frankly, the reason we chose to come to Hue over Hoi An. The massive complex (the exterior walls run for 10km) was largely flattened during the American War (as they call it here) but the reconstructed buildings, the digital simulation of the full site and the opportunity to let your imagination run wild are altogether worth spending several hours of your way to explore.

The exterior walls on their own are impressive enough. There are several bridges over the moat and into the city, which can be hair-raising if you take them by foot as we did but are very do-able.

Once inside you'll get mobbed by locals on bikes offering to give you tours of the city. We declined them all and made our way to the impressive main gates to the citadel (pointer: it's worth stocking up on water either here or inside, as there isn't that much shelter in many areas of the citadel). The gates are impressive however note that right now (July 2013) they're largely covered by scaffolding. Beyond those gates is a large open area with two ponds (complete, to my wife's delight, with large fish) and open areas on each side. Continuing straight takes you to the Thai Hoa Palace - the most impressive building remaining in the Imperial City. Be sure to sit through the video that runs on the left hand side at the rear of the building, which gives you a good overview of the site.

Beyond the palace, you're largely into reconstructions of other buildings. The two galleries are nice enough, and the theatre is impressive albeit cluttered with modern equipment as it is still in use for performances. We enjoyed a walk around the gardens at the rear of the city, as well as the plant nursery that now sits where the Thai To Mieu temple complex used to be. The Forbidden Purple City was completely destroyed by bombing, but it is worth taking a walk up to the top of the foundations and imagining what used to be there.

Overall we spent around four hours in the city and, if it were not so hot, would likely have spent more.

If you have time, check out the nearby General Museum Complex too - a separate fee but close at hand and worth it."
"This place may seem a bit expensive, but it is so worth it! The Citidel is huge! We spent almost 5 hours wandering around the grounds and various buildings. The grounds has a good mix of restored buildings and older ruinous structures. The insides of many of the buildings have been restored and are beautiful. The dynastic urns are also pretty sweet! Finally, you can dress up in traditional royal Vietnamese clothes. How cool is that?"
"Torn up ruins with very few signs to give context or explanation, a waste of time without a guide. Litter all over the place inside the grounds. This was the single most overrated place I visited in Vietnam."
"+ large scale
+ engineering achievement
+ beautiful
+ video inside main building

- Restorations so can only see half
- poor information"
"We paid 105,000VND for the entrance fee which I'm dubious about as there wasn't a sign stating how much it was, I've been researching the fees and just last year (2012) they were 80,000VND, without any official signs it makes me think that the ticketing people can just charge what they like. There are lots of restorations taking place at the moment the citadel is rather run down ie. floor tiles from some sections were missing and they appeared to have been so for quite some time as weeds had begun to grow in the spaces left behind by the absent tiles. There were stone marbles that contained information about the different quarters in Vietnamese, English and French but the writing on them were so worn we struggled reading them. Overall, I did enjoy it but without having done research about the history of the citadel prior to visiting I would not have enjoyed it as much as I did. I think that if I had hired a good personal guide I would have understood and enjoyed it a lot more."
"Unless you're here with a guide or have really done your homework, the place is hard to navigate. There is no information available on site, so we wondered aimlessly for about 1 hour in the scorching heat and then left."
Try and go early because it is huge and you could easily spend an entire day there. It was very hot when we went so take a hat/umbrella. So much to see and lovely people
"We arrived in Hue after an epic fifteen-hour overnight sleeper train and went straight to the Citadel after checking into our hotel. I was very eager to see this, as I love this kind of architecture and history!! Unfortunately this was the most expensive entrance fee we experienced in Vietnam at 105,000 dong (ok, it's not expensive by Western standards, but is by Vietnamese standards).

Our visit coincided with the hottest part of the day, which made the experience less enjoyable (streaming with sweat is not ideal). Other than that, the building itself was ok - it was not well-maintained, which as a history lover, I find incredibly important. Some restoration and preservation attempts had begun, but it was very run-down in general.

Travel Tip: if you go by yourself as we did, and did the Citadel without a guide, read up on it before you go. We weren't really sure of the significance of the location until we returned to the hotel. The Viet Cong were stationed here during the anti-American War and there was a showdown - there are still bullet holes in some of the walls!"
"We read some of the TripAdvisor comments and felt the need to check this place out. It really was eye opening, rather than being disappointed with the restoration we were amazed at the work that is being undertaken mostly by hand with no machines. The time frames for completing some of the work are exceptional. For example, one of the main buildings will be complete in April 2014. We learnt so much about this part of Vietnam by walking around for a good hour or so and looking at everything. In one of the tomb areas it was like an archeological site.

The restoration work is really very beautiful. While much of it is probably gold paint or silver paint it looks like the gold or silver has been applied as leaf.

I think it is very worthwhile to visit this place and get a better understanding of Vietnamese culture."
"We loved seeing the citadel and old buildings, a lot of it is being restored at the moment. We did a cyclo tour of hue which was great as we were provided with a lot of info we wouldn't otherwise have learnt."
"Take plenty of water! It is hot and there isn't a lot of shade. It is a shame that many of the buildings had to be repaired after the war, however it is still an amazing part of Vietnamese history. Try to read a bit about it before or while you are there if your not to keep on spending money on a tour guide or want to get through it relatively fast. I find that most tours in Vietnam tend to drag on and on. Takes about 5 hours to see everything. There is an elephant there for tourists, but its didn't look very happy. There is a small map of the area on the back of your ticket you purchase from the front entrance."
We went early morning but was extremely hot and a long way to walk to even get in people at entrance not friendly. A bit disappointed that lots of the areas were being renovated and couldn't see. No map given only tiny one on the back of entrance ticket. Shops with drinks and ice blocks highly inflated prices. Will be good when renovations complete. Enjoyed the DVD presentation which was informative
"a great piece of history to see and rather recent. Worth a trip to Hue if you are staying in Hoi An or in Da Neng.. A private group for unto 3 people would work out to about USD150/- for a private car hire - this is a good option as the drive is long and you'll get a seasoned guide to tell you all the history and fall of events. its a whole day tour visiting other places too and lunch will be included.... the palace/ citadel architecture is vast and amazing; the concepts and designs used are certainly unique to the region with great influence from the rulers in china. If you can make it, its highly recommended"
"Well, this is what you are in Hue for, in the end. It will not disappoint - a whole day thing, with its better and less restored parts (I loved the latter - less people, at times no other people at all! beautiful colours, interesting architecture, and all of it not glossy overly renovated, but picturesque and interesting to look at)."
"One hears so much about the citadel, but the reality was that it was less than impressive for us. I mean, there were lovely grounds to stroll on and it was a huge site, but many buildings were under renovation so you can't see much. Of course, its value lies in its historical worth but you'll need a very good guide to explain it all in detail."
"This site has interest, and we were most fortunate to have an excellent guide who gave very good and interesting historical details, but there is much restorative work to be done if it is to be returned to its former glory. At this stage, I would say that visitors should not expect too much unless their guide is really very good."
Allow a good amount of time to cover all of this amazing spot. Tragic to realize this historic place is another damaged by senseless war but is being repaired and restored. The atmosphere is wonderful and the many buildings and streets of this ancient city are well worth the visit
"Understand this is under construction but should not be charging the same price as everywhere else when it is poorly up-kept. Would not bother going back , not for 2-3 years anyway when this will be remedied"
You can hire an electric tour car thingie however we found it better to just walk around and discover the citadel for ourselves. Might have just been the rainy weather we seemed to have lots of it to ourselves. Was very peaceful walking around. Took a cyclo from our hotel and they waited for us out front while we walked around.
"A good visit, but make sure you wear comfortable shoes, and try and avoid the hottest time of day! Although there was a lot of damage during the Vietnam war, there is still lots to see, and there is a lot of re-construction work going on. A plan of the building layout is available and like 'Pompei' although there are ruins, a lot of the buildings remain in tact and with a good guide it is easy to bring the site alive."
"Wow factor is as huge as this structure. Built over several years by several successive emperors,it is huge. Get a good tour guide to get the full benefit of what it is all about. We got one through the Hotel who actually worked for the Government,excellent speaking lady,spoke perfect english,great wit who knew her history."
"We thoroughly enjoyed taking a look around both the grounds and buildings in the citadel as well as a long walk around the outside. There is a limited amount of info available, which might have made for a rather dull visit but there is currently lots of restoration work going on & we found watching the traditional techniques being used for parts of that work very interesting. I would hope that by the time the work is finished there will also be some more info about or at least a more in depth guide to purchase. Regardless this is worth looking round if you have time & enjoy such things."
"At such a beautiful place, we found our group accosted by a deranged woman who desired to ingratiate herself into our tour group. We were very uncomfortable for most of the tour because it took Security much too long to act to remove the woman from the premises. To make matters worse, they just took her outside of the grounds of the it Citadel, so that when we exited we noticed she had attached herself to another group. I hesitate to add these details because the Imperial City had so much to see and rich history to absorb; however, I think it's important to keep your eyes and ears open and aware whenever traveling."
"As some of the reviews mention, this was a key location in the ""American War"" (the Vietnam War, in the States), as Viet Cong troops congregated here during the Tet Offensive and held the area for over three weeks. A visit here reveals why it was the longest-held area of the campaign.The Citadel is undergoing restoration, but the focus will be on the Imperial era, not the war. Be sure to look for places in the wall that were replaced after the war, and note the places where bomb/bullet markings still exist. They may not be there much longer, given the current repairs and desire to replicate Beijing's Forbidden City.

Also, bring plenty of water as it gets very hot and very humid quickly, and there are no placed to buy water inside of the site."
"The Citadel was the first site we visited in Hue and we were disappointed.

The entry fee is 105.000vnd which in real terms isn't bad, it is expensive compared to what other sites charge.

I understand much renovation is underway but the current site is untidy, grass over grown and a general lack of signage explaining the history if each building.

There are also tacky shops selling tourist tat in some of the historic buildings which sours the experience."
"A wonderful old city.
No wonder it's a Unesco World Heritage Site.
I haven't seen Peking's Forbidden City but I'm sure this site is certainly up to it."
"Given the recent history of Hue and it's importance to the Viet Nam war, this site is a must see. It is too bad that the Vietnamese have not posted the ""War"" and ""Now"" side by side photos - they are available on the internet. It is an opportunity lost. The site has not been fully restored and the further back in the site the more sparse it gets. What is restored is done well, though, and it is well worth the visit."
The space of the Citadel is|was huge. The King's life with his entourage for us in our days quite very special
A lot of it is interesting but you would need to have a guide to know what it's all about otherwise you'll find yourself wandering through wondering what it's all about. You'll need an hour and a half to see it all. We liked the garden.
The entire comples occupies 6 square kilometres. It has outer walls 21 metres thick and seven sections linked by lovely boulevards shaded be large trees. All this made for a very peaceful setting since there is so much room to spread the tourists out in.
"Not a super wow as it is under construction, but still worth a nice stroll around the complex. Many of the temples are quite beautiful. We got some very nice photos with the colorful orange trees in bloom, Agree, very little customer service."
"This is a massive complex set on 10 Kms so be prepared. Take water and wear comfortable clothing which gives you some cover from the sun, take a hat and decent shoes - not flip flops/ jandals as the floor is very uneven

This is a massive restoration job which is being funded via a number of sources one of which is UNESCO since it was afforded that status

If there's a good English speaking guide available hire one or otherwise make sure that you have a good guide book or its pretty much meaningless

On occasions I had this place to myself which was quite something, as it's very restful and a special place

The restoration work that has been completed is nothing short of spectacular with vibrant reds and golds bringing the place back to life. Go and have a good look under the hoardings to see what they are working on font be put off and walk past like others have

You need to engage with this attraction to get the best from it

Restoration would be made quicker if there were people working on this all this time. I saw no one when I was there which was a Wednesday around 3pm, but then I have no idea how their funding works.,,,

Allow 2-4 hours depending on how into this sort of stuff you are

Make sure that you visit the Fine Arts Museum afterwards and just imagine what the place was like when it was filled with all those fine things, such wealth and opulence!"
"Virtually impossible to know where to get tickets, then on entrance got under changed and not even a simple emotion to say sorry or even welcome. Inside was disappointing, a lot reconstructions going on, scaffolding and everywhere I looked was general maintenance work going on, nothing preserved or historical about this place. Save your pennies for the water bottles. The air crafts on the outside are more impressive. Plus food/drink is available but only at taking the micky prices with laughable customer service, not my idea of attracting people. It was then we decided it would be good to leave."
"Due to previous bombings, the middle of the citadel is a little empty which was interesting to see. The citadel as a whole was beautiful and shows the old empire of Vietnam with a few of the buildings restored to olden days - when we were there, there were artists/construction workers/etc working to restore more of the structure. Very important historical site. Locals and Vietnamese people get in for a discount than foreigners."
"I was very glad to have had a guide for my trip to the citadel, without his knowledge the visit would have been a real let down. Visually I was still somewhat disappointed - so much of it is in ruins - destroyed as a result of war & although restoration has begun there is a long way to go. Our guide painted a picture of it's former glory & it must truly have been an amazing structure. He also had photographs taken at the citadel during the war which gave another perspective - I'd like to go back one day to see the result of the restoration."
"Very disappointing. The entire Citadel is under repair. Only a few relics are there if any. Sad that this structure was not maintained. Much of the area was blocked off due to consctruction. Vendors are selling artwork and tourist items inside which was a complete let down. The buildings hold the heat and with only 2 fans that we seen doesn't help. We found ourselves hot and sweaty! We don't recommend going because we felt that it was a waste of time. Cost 105,000 vnd for entry.
There are steps and uneven pavement. If you have trouble climbing stairs skip this attraction."
"Very huge site, some of it beautifully restored some of it in the process of being restored and some of it left as it was after the war. Take a fully charged up camera and your walking feet."
"This is a nice citadel in the midst of Hue but is not very ancient. Also, parts of it are under repairs so sort of an eyesore. It is part of the itinerary on the Hue day tour."
"Really enjoyed this visit. Seemed to be a work in progress ater the war damage, so vast part still seem to be in need of restoration. beautiful art work and buildings. But be warned, it seemed to hold the heat in this area more than most and we found ourselves constanly looking for shade and water!"
The citadel was not very well maintained and many buildings were blocked off and we could not enter. We also went past a number of rooms being restored.
"On a beautiful summer day it was sobering to recall what devastation futile wars cause in destroying centuries of historical treasures such as this. Thankfully some remains and although the restoration work will be a very long project, it is being done very well using the traditional techniques. A local guide was essential as guide books and signage were not sufficient to get the most of the tour. Allow at least an hour to soak it all up!"
"This is such a worthwhile place to visit - you can feel the history. We spend well over an hour here - and could have stayed longer. Its a glimpse into the past and you can easily imagine the royal family, soldiers, horses and elephants walking down the streets.
Don't miss this if you are in Hue."
"If there's only one thing you can visit in Hue, I would say this would be it.

The grounds are pretty big. Unfortunately, due to natural disasters and wars, most of it is in ruins and therefore there is not as much to see as I would have hoped.

Nevertheless, you could still spend a leisurely 75 minutes or so walking through this place. Restoration and repair is ongoing, and I believe in a year's time, things would be quite improved. 10 minute video inside the main palace (the first building you'll visit if you enter through the main gate) was very helpful to give a general overview of the citadel.

TIP: If you walk around the streets near the citadel, you'll see that its very residential. I thought this was nice to see since most of the sites i've been to are touristy.

Be aware that entrance fee has nearly doubled to 105,000 VND since April 2013 (i.e. in fact, most of Vietnam attractions have increased prices in 2013, including visa). Definitely won't deter most folks if traveling halfway around to world to get here, but it still sucks."
"Perhaps my favorite tourist site in Hue. The place is simply enormous, and reminded me a bit of a much smaller version of the Forbidden City in Beijing. There are some buildings and halls where they have informational signs, I just wished more of the buildings did. Thankfully also, some restoration and repair was going on during my visit, I just wish that more of the place could be repaired and restored."
"Excellent piece of history, just a pity there's not much English description around. We got by with a walking tour from About.com. And on a very very hot day, the main palace with its video + English subtitles and strong fans are a god-send. That aside, my favourite part was the Queen Mother's palace. Has a quiet strong determined character about it, tempered by touches of feminity."
The Citadel is certainly worth a visit if you are in Hue. Lots of history and an excellent restoration program. Our visit was spoiled though as we watched a skinny lame horse being forced to pull a buggy full of locals - left a sour taste in our mouths
So much was destroyed during the Vietnam War that little remains of the original. Remember also that there had to be continual rebuilding because the humid climate quickly damages the building materials and their painted murals.
The walled Imperial city is worth a visit to look around. There is a lot to see and explore if you have time and it is not too hot.
"A fascinating glimpse into Vietnam's past. The decaying citadel complex is well worth a visit. The contrast between the restored buildings and the ruins close by is an indication of Vietnam's troubled history.

Near the gift shop, you can pay a few dollars to dress up as a Vietnamese emperor and sit in a throne!

Relatively expensive for an attraction in Vietnam, but absolutely worth the admission fee.

Do not believe ciclo riders who tell you the Citadel is closed for lunch. It is open all day. They are just making an excuse to get you to agree to a one hour ciclo tour ""until the Citadel opens"". It is a con."
"Watch for the scam near the entrance. Locals posing as Citadel employees directing you to the wrong entrance a long way around the right side (facing Citadel). We saw many people get snared. Tell them to bugger off and step over the 'closed' chain link fence (2 ft high) and go and buy the ticket at the main front entrance.
Inside it is surprisingly quiet and while works are underway it has a long way to go to restore to glory. In China this amazing place would be in A1 condition."
"I think this was the only worthwhile thing I've done while in Hue. It's an interesting old city, well maintained for some Asian standards and there's still some renovation being done, so I guess it will be even better in the future. Ride a bike along the river to get there. It's an easy, nice ride."
"There was nothing to dislike at all, awesome carvings etc. The gold and the intricate work that people did so many years ago with out the tools that man kind has now in this day and age."
I was in Hue for business and went to the imperial city. It is an impressive place although I don't know if I would have stopped for a dedicated visit if I did not have another reason to come here. The signage is not great and I probably would have gotten more out of the experience if I had a tour guide.
"We had wanted to include a visit to the Imperial Citadel and the Old Town of Hue in our tour of Vietnam, but the planets and whatever else were not aligned to make the visit what we hoped. So what went wrong. Firstly we spent a half day visiting some tourist highlights around Hoi An and Danang and arrived at Hue at 3.00 PM in the afternoon on a National Holiday - there were people everywhere. Second we were due to leave Hue at 5,00AM next morning to drive back to Danang for a connecting flight to Hanoi - even the best tour organisers get their scheduling wrong at times. Third - the Hue airport was closed for renovations (hence the dash back to Danang). By the time we got settled into our hotel - Saigon Morin it was nearly 4.00 PM - so what to do.

Fortunately, the hotel was close to most of the key tourist action in Hue so we decided to go to the citadel. We had planned to walk - quite a distance as it turned out - and it was hoty and humid. We needed some cash so we looked for an ATM. The one closest to the hotel was out of action - it was a holiday - the 4th day of a 5 day long weekend in Vietnam. April 30th is the National Day of Liberation, May 1 is Labour day - so with Saturday and Sunday leading up to the two major events the Monday was also taken as a holiday - so nothing official was open - no seciruty guards at banks and their ATMs. The long weekend will be a recurring problem for anyone travelling anywgere in Vietnam in late April - early May eg in 2014 it will also be a 5 day long weekend covering Wednesday- Sunday so you will need to plan your itinerary carefully to stay in a nice resort place like Hoi An for this period.

Two very helpful cyclos directed us to another ATM about 200m down the road to Danang and that much further from our intended destination. Having successfully obtained some cash from the ATM the cyclos pressed their services on us. Given the time of the day, the heat and humidity, the crowds and the prospect of a long walk we eventually relented. We made a fundamental error at this point - we did not negotiate a fixed price for the service offered. We found out later the going rate is arounf 30 - 40000 Dong for an hour on this mode of transport.

A ride on a cyclo is a breathtaking experience particularly at busy intersections in Vietnamtraffic - one feels incredibly vulnerable. To be fair a cyclo ride was probably the best option for us to see as much of Hue as we could in the 3 hours of daylight available to us. The cyclo ride took us along the Perfume river across the bridge to the entrance to the Imperial Citadel and then circumnavigated the impressive walls of the whole site and took us through parts of the Old Town with some really impressive old houses. In all the ride took us just less than an hour. Then the wheels fell off as our ""friendly"" cyclos pulled up in the middle of nowhere in particular and demanded payment for their services. The original negotiation was ""Whatever you like"" - well that does not work. We were ripped off outrageously by these guys and basically we had no redress - they knew we were lacking in small denomination currency (they know the ATMs only deliver 500000 dong notes) and stood over us until we paid out. A most unpleasant experience that put a real dampener on the rest of the day.

So here we were in the middle of nowhere. When we got to the entrance of the Citadel the queues and the mass of people was so pressing we decided to simply walk back to the hotel. We were too late to also take a dragon boat ride to the Pagoda and the royal tombs further down the river - highly recommended visits for Hue.

We ate out for our evening meal visiting a restaurant recommended by the hotel staff, but in the end the Hue experience was a low point on our trip to Vietnam,

We cannot stress enough how important it is to negotiate up front what you will pay for a cyclo ride and to plan where you will be when a 5 day weekend intersects your itinerary."
"I was really looking forward to visiting the imperial city and was vastly disappointed. Call it high expectations but I really didn't feel it was worth the 105,000 VND price tag, a price increase of 50,000 since April. The site has almost no information or facts about the buildings, the signs they do have are weather beaten and faded making them unreadable. If you do go I suggest getting a guide as without it is almost impossible to tell what you're looking at."
"A fascinating place to visit.Not as old as it looks.Was puzzled why it took so many people to issue ticket,check ticket and check again in such a short space before actually entering the citadel. So much work to do on dodgy steps and brickwork pathways that I couldn't help wondering that job creation on manual labour would have been better served than ticket sales!"
Cheap entrance fee to beautiful grounds loaded with history! What we loved about the Imperial City was the freedom to wander around all of the buildings and grounds. The area is within walking distance from the hotel/restaurant area of Hue. One of the highlights of our trip to Vietnam!
"Our guide really brought the Citadel to life. Fascinating to hear about the lives of the Emperors and the French colonial influence on this part of Vietnam's history.

The refurbishments and rennovations will be underway within the month, so perhaps a visit in 2014 might be stunning."
This place is incredible. It would take days or weeks to fully explore the citadel and should not be missed. There is still evidence of the war in many places but this does not detract from the beautiful people and gardens of this inner city.
"Much better than I imagined it to be.
Good, informative video which tells the historical story.
There is a lot of excellent restoration work going on, most impressive!
The garden hidden at the back on the left hand side was absolutely gorgeous and I reckon could be easily missed."
I wish I could come back here in a few years when more of the restoration work has been completed. There is still so much damage to the beautiful buildings I was quite surprised we were allowed to visit some parts of the Citadel.
"I loved the architecture and gardens. To fully appreciate though, you need a guide to explain, point out symbols, the differences in the buildings, etc. There is quite a bit of walking, in the heat. I saw some people on little trains. If you have mobility problems, you may need to ask tour organisers if there are options if you can't walk. After seeing most of the site, our guide showed us one part that was bombed during the war. What a waste! I am so glad the beautiful buildings that we saw, survived."
"Wander around and just enjoy the peace and beauty of the place, it's good to have a guide who can explain all the details of the life inside in the past..."
"beautiful parklands and loads of history, probably would get more out of it if you went with a guide, but there is a lot of signposting to tell you what its about. Get there by Cyclo from main part of town, adds to the excitement."
The grounds are vast; it would be good if you can get a guide who can explain the palace grounds in detail to you. Need 1-2 hours to explore on foot.
"We had two days in Hue, fair enough to see some great places,and there are a lot. We had a private guide, and I do really recommend this, because some and the best places are somehow hard to find without a guide."
"This is a must in Hue, we had a private tour within Hue and saw citadel, one tomb and pagoda. Citadel is quite big, surrounded by walls, inside you can visit several buildings and ruins. Good guide is a plus to understand their great history."
"It's one of those 'must do' places in Hue, and for a good reason. You don't realise just how large it is until you are there. A lot of the original buildings are gone, or derelict. But just to see the size of the place is amazing. A few of the buildings are being renovated, so I'm sure it will get more and more visitors. And for something interesting, feed the quoi fish... they look vicious when food is being offered!"
"The massive old Imperial city covers a large part Hue on the North bank of the Perfume River. We arrived early to beat the crowds and the mid day heat. We hired a private guide which I highly recommend. She guided us thru the massive complex detailing the history and use of various parts of the Citadel. The fortress was the scene of vicious fighting during the Tet offensive in 1968. Many American Marines and Vietnamese died during the battle whose scars still show in variuos places. Much restoration work has been done but many areas still show bullet holes and battle damage.Our guide avoided questions about the battle and stuck to the ancient history and future of the place. She was probably right. After wandering the grounds for two hours, we exited the front gate where I found a large display of captured "" Imperialist American "" military equipment including tanks, helicopters, planes, etc. The Vietnamese Communist Party wanted it very clear who won the war.The whole day was eye opening and enjoyable. A must for anyone interested in history."
"it was very hot when we visited but we were keen to seen the imperial city, the city was almost totally destroyed in fighting between the American and Vietnamese armies, but has been restored over a number of years and this is still going on. The restoration is to a very high standard and it is hard to tell what is new and what is original. There are workmen on site and you can watch while they carry out restoration work.Before you enter the main complex you will be able to watch a video presentation on the history of the site including the destruction."
"Thick walls, the few gates through it and the flag tower make it ""must"" see if you visit Hue. also because it surrounds the forbidden purple city.
The size is what causes the biggest ""wow"""
"Its a good days walk around, and see the old Hué kingdom. And learn about the city's history.
Cost around 100.000 vnd. to get in and you get a ticket to the local museum aswell."
We walked along river bank walkway where possible and then over bridges to and from the Citadel - some areas of old palace are being refurbished but overall other than size it is not a great attraction.
loved being shown around and all the buildings etc explained to us by the very informative guide. Because it had rained the night before the Elephant rides were unavailable :(
"The purple city is in the heart of Hue and can be visited by foot if you are in the city ignore the rickshaw and bike people they will tell you its miles away ,also in the entrance fee to the Citadel is the museum and this is also a great visit both can be done in a day. When you want to visit the museum look for the green golf buggy's they will take you from the purple city direct to the museum at no cost extra ...A must see attraction."
Very interesting. An easy walk from our hotel just across the river. A lot of restoring going on which is a good thing.be sure to watch the reconstructed video inside the purple forbidden city .
"We visited the Citadel as part of a local historical tour and found it very worthwhile. The place covers hectares of land, is amazing! It is huge so bring your walking shoes and plenty of water, do not forget your sunscreen and hats.

Hue's imperial citadel is basically the only best thing of Hue. Hue itself is just boring, and a bit depressing but the citadel is a place of quiet time. Guide is worthwhile to visit everything and get full information about history and reconstruction process."
"A fascinating historic site, it suffered a considerable amount of damage during the Vietnam war which is being sympathetically and steadily restored. Lots to see across a large multi-building site, well presented and with maps and guides to explain its' history and place the site in context. Go early, this gets really busy. Lots of walking / some steps so comfortable shoes and good mobility fairly important."
"Beware - wear comfy clothing and footwear - there is plenty of walking!
This is a definite must see in Hue (cost $4 AUD each to enter) - restoration work is continuous, but there is still plenty of outbuildings that are still in ruins. Best to go early in the day as it is quite strenuous being out in the heat and humidity as the city is quite exposed.
After initially being politely hassled by a cyclo driver, we decided to give in after realising how big the citadel was (this was before we'd even hit the Imperial City)! Mr Hoa and Mr Tang were our cyclo drivers and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience with them - they drove us around the citadel, taking us to a couple of sites, before stopping at the Imperial City where they waited just on two hours for us to return. Following this, Hoa took us to a 'local' restaurant where we shared lunch and a couple of beers - I've tried to search for Mr Hoa on trip advisor, but have not been able to find anything, thus reviewing here. He also runs 'Friendly Motorbike Tours' (107/11 Ngo Duc Ke St. Hue City - 0914 540 565) - we were going to make our way down the perfume river by ourselves for the day, but we ended up on a 5 hour tour with Hoa & Tang on their motorbikes, and saw much more, in less time! Highly recommend these two guys - very friendly and good english speaking."
"The Citadel is a massive complex, much of which is in ruins. If you visit, remember that you are in Vietnam, one of the poorest of countries. That there is a willingness to restore this site is to the country's credit. It will be a slow process and won't necessarily align with Western sensibilities as to restoration. There is a lot of walking and little shade, few places to rest, few 'creature comforts'. Go with a tour or do your homework - sort out what you want to see, how much time you want to spend, etc. If visiting here appeals to you, you will be rewarded with a sharpened sense of life in a very old civilization and the enduring beauty of Hue."
"We spent several hours here. It is a huge complex which was severely damaged during war and is slowly being restored to its former glory. Fascinating to see how the work is being done -it seems that the old ways are the good ways . We did not take a tour. Just wandered and read the signs, but had read up a but before . Highly recommended. Also struck an excellent performance of Hue traditional music which was the enormous cost of 70000 dong! Great value for money.
Also, it is well set up for those who don't want/ can't walk for long, as there are buses, electric cars and horse and cart to get around. It does have an 11 km perimeter, so there can be a lot of walking."
"I spent a lot of time here and I really enjoyed it. Yes, much of it was destroyed during the war, yes they are rebuilding it, and yes it might have lost some of its historical significance, but it is still an incredible place to visit and well worth it. It was very hot while I was there but I still managed to see so much and there are plenty of 'Pineapple' ladies around to keep hydrated. Don't miss this incredible site."
"The citadel is a massive area with a number of interesting buildings, shame the majority of it was destroyed during the Vietnam war. What is left (and is being restored) gives a great insight into the lives of the kings in Vietnam. A must visit while in Hue, but be warned, on a hot sunny day it can be very tiring."
A dragon boat trip up the river with a stop off at the Pagoda first then a final drop off at the Citadel. We didn't bother going into the Citadel but opted to walk part way around it.
"How spectacular this city must have been before the conflict that destroyed the Purple Palace, it is still wonderful to walk through these grounds, and marvel at how spectacular it was. Restoration is taking place and hopefully in year to come it will be restored to its former glory"
"The cover charge now includes the Royal museum so the price is now 150'000vnd, previously 50'000 . Though it has been extensively remodelled and thus has lost much of it's charm and archaeological significance it is still worth a look.

They have an informative DVD that details the history of the site and much of the information is in decent English. Some of the grounds have been left in their ruined state which is arguably more interesting than reinstalling and renovating the whole sight.

The gardens are pleasant to walk around, as is lake. However, if you are on a limited budget or timeframe you can get a good feel for the place from walking around the citadel walls, which is free and it is where the more iconic photos can be taken"
"We spent a few hours wandering around here as part of our cycling tour, the place is enormous and some of the buildings have very ornate timber work and decorations. A lot of restoration work is currently being done by Unesco and it will be gorgeous when restored to its former glory. Probably best doing a guided tour so you can understand some of the history and significance of certain buildings or areas. If you aren’t up to walking around the entire complex, there are plenty of electric cars which will zip you around from one highlight to the net, or back to the entrance. Don’t miss this if you’re in Hue."
"A smaller version of the Forbidden City in Beijing. Don't get me wrong though, the complex is huge! One needs a bike or a rickshaw to go around the whole of the walled city."
"Definitely a must see attraction when you are in Hue. The scale of this Citadel is smaller than Beijing, but it is different in term of culture and tradition. For example, there is dragon always symbolizing the king, but Vietnamese dragon is not the same as chinese one. Neither is The king throne.
One of mu suggestion it should have more direction and name board for tourists in multilanguages. Otherwise, it is not easy for those without tour guide to navigate themselves in the map. Another thing is if you travel in summer, get yourself a cap or umbrella, since the sun will kill you..."
"a lot has been destroyed during the last century , but it is worth to visit this old city. The imperial area, the queen area and the concubines area. Take a guide to explain you."
"A great place to visit! There is an interesting short film at the beginning that recreates how it would of looked at the time of the emperor, a lot of the buildings are being restored and I must say I'd love to go back and see it when they are finished! When we went in April it was very hot so take an umbrella as most of it requires walking out in the open."
"By the time you read this the Imperial City may deserve 4 stars. A major complex that has suffered significant damage with the war and with time. It is well worth a visit and the entry cost to appreciate the scale of the palace and to see the very impressive restoration work being done. The works will clearly take many years but doing it as quality rather than speed is the way it seems to be going. Very little is roped off, even where the restoration work is in progress, so you can see detail of what they are undertaking. A guide is essential to know what you are looking at when some of it is just shapes in the ground."
"After 6 months travelling around South East Asia, it was hard to find a place that will still surprise us. WEll this place did the job just fine, by showing us a new style of temples, gardens and architecture. Really well maintained, quiet and interesting. Don't miss it if you have the chance to go to Hue."
"Emperor Gia Long began building his Imperial City (also known as the Purple Forbidden City) in 1804. During the battle of Hue in 1968, the city was badly damaged and of 160 buildings only 10 major sites remain but the government with the help of other countries is painstakingly rebuilding the city. It became a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1993. It is a most pleasant stroll through the city early in the morning before the tourist buses arrive along with the high temperatures."
"This is a very large space, so takes a while to walk around. Areas are being restored and is was fascinating to see the difference between the before and after, and particularly interesting watching artists painting the ceilings."
"There is so much history with the Imperial City and our tour guide did a great job explaining it. It was neat to hear how the common people lived outside of the citadel, and the royal family lived inside the citadel. If you are in Hue, you should definitely check this place out."
"It is worth a visit and great to hear the history behind it. However, it can become tedious and certainly doesn't need the 2 hours we spend there with our Tour Guide!"
"They told us we should get a bike (or a motor bike) and they were right. You will need half a day to run around or a full day to visit in slow mode!

It's huge, it's unique. You will feel in the ""last emperor"" movie, as the idea is the same.
They were repairing some of the buildings, it will be really clean and well conserved one oh these days.

Worth to go there for a full day, with a lunch box and live slowly around."
Steeped in history and legend it was a real eye opener on the life of people and their rulers hundereds of years ago
Don't just stop at the main part take a good half day to explore down the many paths that lead to more temples than you would ever know existed. It goes on for miles with fishh ponds and beautiful grounds that are being done up. A real work in progress worth a good visit not a fleeting one.
"this is based on the forbidden City Beijing, not as well preserved, sometimes a little run down and neglected, cigarette butts on the ground dirty habit, it is a great afternoon to spend here and lucky it was saved during the American war, some parts have been destroyed"
"Some people on our tour likened this to the Forbidden city in China.
We started out earlier in the morning mainly to take advantage of the coolness - walking and taking in the history and information is better and we did walk a long distance visiting the many buildings.
It is a very impressive place to visit."
"Began to be built by order of the Nguyễn Phúc Ánh, the himself proclaimed Emperor Gia Long, in 1804, it is surrounded by a moat and a wall with around 10 kms long. Includes the Imperial city which includes the Purple Forbiden City, by itself. It is a World Heritage site since 1993."
"Went by rented motorbike to this one as it is just across the river from the main and new part of Hue. One way traffic around the citadel until you are at the entrance and go inside. An impressive structure reflecting how many (but not all) kings cut themselves off from the outside Vietnamese society, with their chosen queen and many royal concubines. Interesting inside reflection back into their history. John G Australia"
Quite a difference compared with the Forbidden city of Beijing. Anyway the restoration is on going with beautiful dragon carvings on the walls and furniture. Do not miss the cultural shows. I missed it because their was no notices to inform about the time of the show. need to ask the people mending the Citadel.
"I enjoyed my afternoon out here, but managed to lose my scooter ride back, so paid a whole $2 to return to hotel. U could spend quite a lot of time here. NEXT time I'll b prepared for a longer visit. Did enjoy it immensely and would prob pay for guide next time but they need to b booked in advance. March was extremely hot tho so choose a cooler month. I come from the tropics but it was too hot for me to really enjoy it."
"The layout of the Imperial City (huge, and involves a fair bit of walking), the buildings and architecture were things to behold. A rickshaw rider told me that the VietCong were holding out in the old city while the Americans were in the new city, and mchh fighting happened in or near the Imperial City. Much to the crdit of the Vietnamese, there was little in the way of political statements at the Citadel."
"we could find a lot of historic values here. From the construction to the assets inside this Imperial City, we feel like living in this era."
Well worth a visit. Good mix of old and restored buildings and relics. Worth having a guide. Very hot and humid.
"We had a well informed guide ""Harry"" which made for a very enjoyable time. We were so happy to see the restoration going on."
"The most important part of Hue is the Imperial City. Located a pleasant walk or short taxi ride across the river from the city centre (I suggest walking one way through the gardens along both sides of the river) you are greeted with the imposing sight of the Citadel, complete with a massive Vietnamese flag.

Once inside you find extensive grounds with a variety of structures in different states of condition. The city was heavily bombed so there are a number of ruins as well as some restored buildings.

I spent about an hour wandering around and enjoyed it. With a guide you could spend longer and get into details if that's your thing."
"Well worth a visit to understand the context of Hue and the surrounding tombs and mausoleums. I was glad we had a guide to explain the significance of colours, architecture and symbols as signage is limited. There is significant damage to the site as is sadly the case all over Vietnam, but the site is being restored carefully supported by UNESCO.

Well worth a visit, but along with a guide, take water and a hat, there is precious little shade and it can get seriously hot!"
"We read in the travel guide book that it was 55,000 dong. But now it's double, 105,000! I asked about 55,000 dong but she just ignored me. I asked the the ticket controller why it's increased. He explained that the fee just increased this month, and now it's inclusive the entrance to the museum too. Frankly speaking there is nothing much too see there. And moreover it's out of the way. There is no proper signage where it is. We kept asking and they just pointed here and there, and we kept on walking looking for it. Luckily, on the way there was another couple looking for it too, and was asking around. Finally, they're told that we can hop on a green trolley which will take us there and it's free. Gosh, as least the ticket counter should explain to the visitors. The trolley driver was just sitting in the corner chatting and smoking."
"Wonderful site. There is an interesting short video with some computer simulations and a hint of vietnamese propaganda :) in the room beyond the throne hall. After that we just enjoyed the vast area with a mix of buildings in different stages of restoration. The fact that quite some buildings were destroyed is a shame, but at the same time gives you the opportunity to see more of the structure, and harmonious set up of the whole city. I thought it very impressive. We didn't have a guide, but I think when you can find a good one go for it. There is so much more you can learn and it makes the experience even better.

We did the trip from Hoi An, as a day trip. That makes for a really long day - And Hue is worth a longer visit...

One last remark:
Avoid the first refreshment shop immediately to the left of the assembly/throne hall. They charge double the price of the other shops further down the city area...."
"Went in the afternoon and fortunately it was not too hot, humid or crowded. Well worth a visit though much has been detroyed by the French, some bulidings have been restored and others are being worked on. Some of the bulidings are very impressive. The complex covers a very large area and there is quite a lot of walking, so be prepared if you visit on a hot day."
"A most do in Hue. We had a great day at the citadel learning about the emperors and the concubines and life inside the city in the late 19th and early 20th century. Our tour guide (Anh) was most impressive, and seemed to know it all. We visited on such a hot day and there was little shelter from the sun. Wera a hat and take water."
"A Cyclo driver snapped two of us up and negotiated this price for 1.0 hours. A great way to see the perimeter, back to the main citadel which took a bit longer and it got a bit nasty when we went over time. Still we paid the agreed price."
"We visited the Citadel as part of a local historical tour and found it very worthwhile. The place covers hectares of land, is amazing and will be even better when it's full reconstruction is complete (est to be another 15 years!). Unfortunately most of the important buildings (Forbidden City within the Citadel) were destroyed by the French in their exit of the country, however the restoration work that is being done gives you a feel for how magnificent this place must have once been. It is also surrounded by a moat dug out by thousands of workers and the clay excavated from here used for all of the brick-work within the structure. Amazing!

Make sure you add this place to your sightseeing itinerary when visiting Hue (go to the Mandarin Café - see separate review, to organise your tour)."
"The Imperial City is beautiful and has lots to explore and look at. We started on the left side where the tanks and jets were which the kids loved. Have the cab drop you off here. They also loved feeding the fish at the entrance.

This place is huge so bring your walking shoes and plenty of water. Don't forget your sunscreen and hats. Bring your own snacks because they are expensive inside and there is no restaurant. It takes a few hours of walking around to full appreciate this city.

We didn't do this, but you can also pay to dress up in traditional Vietnamese costumes and pose like royalty.

We had a great time exploring here and would go back again!"
"Inside Hue's imperial city you can dress up in traditional Vietnamese garb and pose like a moron. This was hilarious and worth every penny. The entire place is pretty and peaceful and worth a wander around, though the entry price is a bit steep given that there's not much else to do inside. But go, dress up. Hope for a cool day."
Great piece of history unfortunately partially bombed by the French and the US. Being restored over time. Allow plenty of time to have a thorough look around and make sure you have suitable footwear to walk over uneven ground. Make sure you find the theatre - a beautifully restored building.
"I'll start with the bad news-there are no restaurants inside, only super expensive crackers or junk food, so bring a snack or fruit because this place is huge and you'll need a few hours to really see everything-a little longer if you have kids, but still want to see everything at a slower pace.

Good news-the grounds are amazing. There are so many buildings, most are labeled, and it's worth the time to see it all. There are some areas where there aren't any people and you may not be sure if you're allowed to go in-you can go in. and you'll want to. If there's not a sign (which I'm not sure I saw any) then go for it-go through that random tiny door in the corner that looks like a current workers bedroom/office-you won't regret it. Temples, living quarters, theatre, throne room-all of it is amazing and picture worthy (but you can't take pictures of the throne room)."
"After coming from Hoi An, it was a big contrast when Hue locals tried to rip us off 5 times within our first hour in Hue... Especially disappointing that the girl at the reception of the Citadel played her part in that as well. Not a great start. And then the Citadel in itself: more a construction site than a historic place. Some buildings a shining with fresh paint, others are piled up with trash. And then there is a tennis court int the middle of it all... (???). A waste of time as far as I am concerned: the view of the wall from the outside is the best, keep it at that and spend your time by doing more authentic things, like visiting the market in Hue."
"Some builds had been destroyed during the war. And they have rebuilt little by little.
The atmosphere is good. You can go in the early morning, because ut's cooler than in the afternoon.If you go by yourself you could bring a bottle of water with you to drink, because they didn't sell any water there. The architecture even small but it's natural suit.
Because the citadel is huge, so you need to take more time to visit all of them."
"some builds still intack other destroyed during the war. They have restored two and look wonderful but lets hope dont over do the newness of the reconstruction as will lose its magic

The theatre is air conditioned great to see and there are still performances every day.

Very hot and humid. Go early. Only best thing in Hue"
"Hue's imperial citadel is basically the only best thing of Hue. Hue itself is just boring, and a bit depressing. But the citadel is a place of quiet time and realising what damage America did to Vietnam"
We paid for a guide & we were glad that we did. History of the Citadel is so interesting & it will become even more as restoration continues. I would suggest that you do a little research before you arrive to get the most our of the site. Saw this site first before visiting the War Museum in Saigon where there are lots of photos of the war in Hue & shots of the Citadel. Sad but memorable.
It is definitely a very important historical site that is in the process of being restored. A huge project. If you don't have a guide it is quite confusing as to which building is which. Audio guides would be a great assistance. Need quite a bit of time to take it all in. It is a large site and most of it in ruins.
"Beautifully built with with a sense of history that just won't let go!
Bullet holes still visible from american invasion."
"Parts are beautifully restored, but other areas awaiting the funds to make this a 'Must Do' when visiting Vietnam"
"The history is real interesting, and the display in the throne room was again very informative. There is clearly a lot of restoration work going on which will help visitors to understand the nature of this site. For me if was good, however when completed I think it will get better."
"It is a large area with lots of walking, so I recommend arriving early in the day to avoid overheating in the late afternoon. We were limited on time and had to power thru to see as much as we could. Sadly there was damage due to the bombing during the war, but many buildings are still open to tour and others are being restored.

Unfortunately we did not see all of the City, but enjoyed what we did see."
Bit disappointing. We did however visit the citadel after having toured 2 tomb sites on the outskirts of Hue that were IMO much more interesting and picturesque. We did however really enjoy the Fine arts museum which is just outside the citadel area.
The story behind the imperial city is very interesting and the temples are really nice. Definitely worth a visit while in Vietnam.
Not on the scale of Japan - but astouding nevertheless. Gradually being restored - and those parts do give an inkling of what it would have been like
Incredible city.A full tour takes two hours and half minimum.Early morning start (9 AM) of your visit is recommanded to avoid too many tourists.Guide is worthile to visit everything and get full informations about history and reconstruction process.
"We went at 7am and just as well, it gets so hot. I would recommend taking a cart around because walking everywhere makes you hot and is tiring. The sign boards/info boards don't contain enough information so it holds no meaning if you don't have a guide. We weren't offered a guide and didn't see any signs about one at the entrance. Spend 2 hours walking around and most of the buildings look the same. I wouldn't spend a full day there. Getting out can be quite a walk. Start on the left upon entering."
"A large walled citadel complex with several different buildings to examine, including throne rooms, theatre and also the history of the last kings of Vietnam - all fascinating stuff. Renovations to all buildings damaged during the bombing following the 1968 Tet Offensive is being carried out slowly but surely and it is a lovely place to wonder round. Sunset over the citadel and river is quite beautiful."
"Most interesting relics, etc., of the royal age. Reconstruction is moving ahead and the ""touch-ups"" so far are enchanting. Great for photography, geography and well worth the entry fee.
Still lots of ""ruins"" to entrance the purists.
A small tip -- you can photograph the ""No photography"" royal throne rooms simply be standing at a window and shooting. The guards actually suggested this to me when they saw I was carrying a camera.
Walking out the ""back"" gate takes you deep into ""old"" Hue with lots of shops, schools, parks and friendly people. With a map the trek can be a tad long in the March heat, but it is well worth the effort."
"The Citadel is an impressive, moat circled brick structure encompasing military aspects as well as imperial dwellings. There are numerous temples, palace buildings and plazas. However the overall complex lacks detailed, comprehensive descriptions thereby reducing the potential impact of the site.

Study before visiting, the more detailed the better."
"I enjoyed the visit, but would have appreciated more signage. But this was the only place in vietnam where i let down my guard and was fiddled out of vnd 20000 when buying the tickets, okay only 20000 but i was annoyed with myself particularly as it was the official ticket seller who did the fiddling!"
"A great way to spend an afternoon whilst in Hue.

The site was heavily damaged by US bombing during the war and bullet holes can still be seem in many of the walls. There is a lot of restoration taking place and it will look great when it is finished but I do hope that they leave some walls untouched as a reminder of the war.

A ""must see"" on a visit to Hue."
"Vietnam is working hard to bring back the splendor of the citadel. The sprawling complex is a mix of reconstruction and ruins, an interesting piece of history, worth a stroll."
"There's a lot of history to be absorbed, but it will take a lot of money to restore it to visual elegance."
"Such a jaw-droppingly awesome place to mooch around, particularly when you consider that it was by and large destroyed by the Americans. The detail in all the different parts of the Citadel is incredible and there is a lovely garden by the exit gate which is beautifully peaceful to wonder around as well."
The colorful porcelains and ancient architecture are what classifies this former royal palace grounds as a World Heritage City. Make sure to get a certified guide who wear name badges as we could not understand our guide at all. Glad we studied the guide book ahead of time. Sad that the Viet Cong bombed all but ten of the original 160 buildings. The Allied Forces were instructed not to bomb or destroy any historical sites. UNESCO provides funds or restoration. We recommend visiting Hue to enjoy the green tiled roofs for the Mandarin and the yellow tiled roofs for the Emperor and Empress ( though he had over 100 wives!). Explore the city by cycle coaches or by foot. Good Appetite was a great place for lunch. Y Thao is the name of this restaurant Inn.
This needs major renovation work which unfortunately will take a long time but will be great when done
"Most tourists visit the Citadel in Hue as part of a day tou that also includes the Royal tombs. In retrospective, I should have visit it independently, as the tour is rushed."
The vast imperial city is well worth a visit. Most of it had succumbed to the ravages of time and the American bombers and it is presently undergoing a sensitive restoration. Some more signage in English would have helped but all in all - a very pleasant visit.
"Although a Hue´s landmark and a must-see it is not well maintained, not many information written in English, the map of the place comes in the back of a tiny ticket with no explanations. Too expensive (US$ 4 / 80.000 VND) for such a unorganized place. The staff are there doing you the big favour of selling you the ticket. They are not polite, rude and not friendly at all. They don´t speak, they push you and signalize.There is not much left after fires, wars and careless governments and it is going to be worse since there is nobody taking care of the
temples, palaces and houses. There are only two palace that has any security. The Royal Theatre charges you more US$ 5 / 100.000 VND to go in. No directions to make the visit. We spent 3 hours there wandering. Overall a nice experience. We do not know the real Imperial City in China so it was worth. We got there walking but the cycle rickshaws charge US$ 2 / 40.000 VND to take you there from the city center. During summer take water with you because there is not many places to sit and not much shadow either. Do not miss the film they show in Thai Hoa Palace. It is one of the best things of the visit because it gives you a glimpse of what this place once was."
"Though largely destroyed during the Tet Offensive, what remains of the Imperial City and The forbidden Purple City is awe-inspiring. It roused our imaginations more than any other place we saw in Viet Nam"
Clearly a must see sight. Very interesting and some good restoration work in progress. Suspect we would have got more out of it with a better guide too.
Such a spectacle not to be missed. The carvings on most of the buildings were amazing. Do find the time to visit.
"Bad maintained, unorganized, very touristic, unfriendly staff, expensive and boring. If you want to see something beautiful, you better go to the Minh Mang Tomb in my opinion."
"The complex would have been facinating in its day but there is still along way to go. We enjoyed seeing the areas that were open to us but there were some that were off limits or too damaged to appreciate. Cameras not allowed in the interiors of most buildings and a couple of hours is plenty to see all that is available here. If short on time and given a choice, see the tombs first - they are magnificent."
"There are so many haunting images of the Citadel as you walk around the worn torn ruins of this once glorious historical space. Walking through the Citadel, it is quite evident of how the 1000 year Chinese hold on Vietnam had influenced the Vietnamese Imperial history. This fact was quite evident in all the architecture and statues of the city as we were informed by our tour guide that the Vietnamese Emperor was so impressed with the Imperial City in China after one of his visits that he insisted on recreating the Forbidden City in Hue for his royal family. It is a hauntingly peaceful space to wonder around for hours to take in all the layers of history. As you wonder around, you will notice images of recent restorations from the freshly painted red and gold lacquered buildings (it seems major renovations have been and are continuing to be a priority to preserve this tremendous piece of history) moss and grime covered cemented bridges and dragon structures, faded blue tiled art walls, bombed out structures and bullet riddled cement walls (from American bombings) freakishly enormous koi with gaping mouths in the man made lake by the bridges, to the resilient elephants in the once amazing zoo. I would highly recommend this as a must see experience not only while you are in Hue but when you are in Vietnam."
You should allow plenty of time for this attraction -- so much to see and you get lots of walking exercise too. This should definitely be on your list not to be missed. Many photo opportunities. Well worth the ticket price.
"Only regret in this is that we only had one day and tried to cram this site in as well. Simply ran out of time end energy to make the most of our visit.

The site is large with plenty to wander around and explore. Probably better with a guide and make sure you spend at least 2 to 3 hours visiting the site. Plenty of sections and buildings to explore. Also plenty of restoration work going on. Very impressive seeing what has been restored and the quality of the completed work done so far. 80k dong is well spent - this helps provide funds for ongoing work and is hardly expensive when compared to major historical sites in the western world.

Definitely worth a thorough visit."
"I had read about the fire in 1947(?) and the damage in the war, but was disappointed to see how little of the original palace has survived. Nonetheless, a must-see when in Hue."
"Walking across the bridge to get there was fun and the Citadel is a work in progress. We have been to the Imperial Palace in Beijing, so we were a little jaded. This place has a lot of promise, but there is a lot of work to do in restoring it. Four dollars to get in (not cheap in comparison to other sights), but the best deal was $5 for a guide, who showed us a lot of places we might have missed and had lots of good info on the Royal Family, but not so much on general stuff. Definitely worth a visit with a guide for 11/2 to 2 hours."
"We went with a guide, who explained the history etc and made it worthwhile. Allow time to stroll around and enjoy. Parts slowly being restored. The theatre is worth a visit and if possible see the show. an enjoyable experience"
"I must agree with the previous reviewer - if you've seen the Imperial City in Beijing you will be disappointed here. Otherwise, probably good for an hour or so."
w e walked to the citidal over the river bridge which we enjoyed took us half an hour and then spent 3-4 hours walking round the citidel very interesting you can still see bullet holes from the war but they are restoring a lot of the buildings
"We visited this place with a guide who told us a lot about this Citadel, which is quiet impressiv. The buildungs are party restored, but still very nice to look at. Unfortunately part of it is destroid and the try to build it up again according to old documents."
"The citadel is definitely worth a half day visit. Whilst it was badly damaged during the American war it is being carefully restored in places. However, its a very long term project. A guide is essential to allow you to understand the workings of the Imperial City."
"If you havent been to the forbidden city in Beijing, you may visit this. Forbidden purple city is a part of the Imperial city."
"I found the city interesting at first, and was willing to pay for the entrance to explore more.

When I tried to buy a ticket from the 2 women at the ticket-selling desk, my ""Excuse me"" was completely ignored. Firstly I thought they were just stupid staff with bad attitudes, since this was quite common in where I am from: China.

And then there were 2 white people, a couple, coming for tickets. The 2 women ticket-officers were smiling and being unexpectedly nice to them. I got confused and so disappointed, the Vietnamese women who served at the ticket table were Asian themselves, an yet they were truly horrible to me, who is Asian just like them, and meanwhile unbelievably trying to flatter white people.

And also, the entrance fee was 80,000 Don, I paid a 100,000 bill cuz I didn't have any changes, and they didn't give me the changes. I was extremely shocked that I didn't notice the money until I entered, I take this as partially my fault since I wasn't paying attention to it, yet still I do believe it is the very basic principle of every profession to pay back the changes.

I wasn't wearing anything or showing things that might suggest where I am from. So I guess the only explanation would be that I didn't have a WHITE FACE which these 2 Vietnamese women favored.

The palace was nothing worth to see after all, you can find a lot better in China and Japan."
"The citadel is a really interesting mix of original architecture, restoration and ruin. Having been here about 8 years ago you can see the change is immense and how much work has been done to restore the damage and recreate what was there. In a lot of ways this is a shame as soi h of the damage from the war and the ruin is intrinsic to the history of the place and what made it what it is but at the same time they are doing a really good job if the restoration and the site it more interesting (if less authentic) for it...

Give this place the time it deserves to explore and relax and enjoy the experience. It is massive - and needs time to truly appreciate."
"Worth visiting, take water with you. Quite a walk to see it all but very worth it. The red tiled area was quite spectacular."
"Like The Forbidden City in Beijing but much less crowded.It was heavily damaged by US bombing during the war but it is slowly being restored and they seem to be making a good job of it.
Definitely a ""must see"" on a visit to Hue."
"A welcome respite from the trials of the Vietnamese traffic.Memorable architeture, really nice gardens. Two elephants witnessed, the elder of which could in my opinion could benefit from the attention of a vet to treat a nasty looking facial skin condition."
Reserve 2 hours to visit the Citadel. Every inch is worthwhile visiting. A guide is needed to understand the grandeur of the site.
"Highly recommended. We did it in our own time, without a travel agency. It's in a walking distance from all hotels in Hue's center. We did it in 5h going very slowly and we finished with a short (30min) Vietnamese performance in a theater within citadel. Good day out!"
"Did this in the afternoon on a Sinh coach tour but after the a day of other sites we arrived a bit temples out. Usual 80k fee, nice lake as you enter with truly huge koi carp in their hundreds. The sights are spread across a large area with a few buildings nicely restored with other building no more than green spaces. Lots of interesting info if you have a guide as I can't what you would take in without. Takes a good hour to walk around and plenty of good photo shots. Possibly would have got more out of it wasn't a follow on from morning sites but it does make part of a full day tour so a must see for 1st visit to Hue."
The visit to the Imperial City was very illuminating about the former royal dynasties in Vietnam. We learned a huge amount from our guide about all the kings and how they lived in seclusion and luxury.
"Must have been an amazing place prior to the American war and the bombing of this city. Reconstruction is under way but will take many years to finish. Found it very interesting and well worth a visit.

The exit is not the entrance so be prepared for a long walk back to the exit if you end your tour back at the entrance."
"It's huge. So, make sure you budget a whole day if you can. If you can't use electric carts on the premises to tour the citadel. For $5, they are well worth it."
"You get a very good impression about the ""old"" live of Vietnam. Although many builduings have been destroyed by the US."
"this was a facinating tour and the place to have a tour guide, ours was able to duck round the masive tour groups so we had a quiet and interesting experience"
In itself it is a wonderful building full of historical significance. When you add in the recent history of the War and its role it becomes even more fascinating.
"We went to the Citadel today and we were enjoying the sights and history and then we saw the elephants. There were two elephants that had a chain around their ankle, which wasn't longer than ten feet long. The first elephant we saw had a huge gash on its face, which you could tell the elephant was in pain since its trunk kept touching the huge wound. The food was just out of reach for the elephant so it kept trying to get its food, but couldn't. There was no water or shade for the elephant either, it's ""conditions"" were heart breaking. The second elephant didn't have any obvious physical abuse, but looked demoralized and just kept swaying back and forth surrounded by its own excrement, It had no food or water either. Seeing such animal abuse was sickening and shocking, and completely ruined the Citadel experience. However, the saddest part I'd that I just checked the poor reviews for the citadel and another reviewer complained about the cruelty and abuse of the elephants almost a full year ago and obviously nothing has changed. Please, if you love animals don't support this attraction. Truly horrible."
"neglected !! only the entrance is worth for a picture.
price: 80.000 dong p/p.big complex,. maybe if your are very interested in the history of the late Vietnam emperors it is value,but my impression is the allround neglect!!"
"It is worthwhile to visit the whole complex and hear the local guides narating the history of the Nguyen Dynasty. Inside The structure is the same with the Old Chinese cities, first the administrative buildings, then the royal palaces and the shrines and then the Forbidden City (the residence of the Emperors,their family members and the concubines.You can find there the Flag tower, the Noon Gate, the Nine Dynastic Urns, the Bell Tower Thai Hoa palace and the Forbidden Purple City.Iloved the promenade and the surroundings."
"This is a must see if you are in Hue. The similarities to the Forbidden City in Beijing are huge but even though this is a smaller site, it is just as interesting. Be prepared for quite a bit of walking and the fact that some buildings are currently being refurbished or rebuilt. Particularly interesting is the Korean video which digitally reconstructs what the original complex must have been like."
"Be prepared for lots of walking. We had rented a scooter from our hotel, which we would highly recommend for getting around Hue. It was easy to park in a little patrolled lot very close to the Citadel entrance. Lots of history, not well detailed though. NOTE: the exit is quite a walk from the entrance (to the far right of the entrance) so explore to your left upon entering...and you can exit to the right."
"Just came back from here with my partner. It was a nice walk to the Citadel and the outside appearance is quite impressive. I loved the old ruined part of the Citadel and I can appreciate what they are doing to restore it but I think it actually takes some of the charm away from it. I hated to see the elephants they have here swaying back and forth, obviously distressed. They keep the seats on their backs all day and the elephants was trying to shake it off. My lovely afternoon was tainted by the sight of these poor majestic creatures being chained to the spot, as were some of the nearby ponies who couldn't lift their heads fully as the tether was too short."
"We were driven around by a Cyclo driver who was able to give us much more information than we would have learnt had we been on our own. He showed us where the Viet Cong were fighting , bullet holes etc. He also showed us lots of lovely places which are museums which again we wouldn't have know we could go in. Interesting but not as good as the Forbidden Purple City if you are pushed for time."
"Like being in another century, this ancient city will take more than a day to visit. Pay attention to details for those appreciating craftsmanship, furniture joinery, planed wooden wallboards, carvings, sculptures...really fascinating and a treasure trove of information for those seeking knowledge from the past."
"I had been here before 12years ago and was nice to see it being restored. The Citadel was partly destroyed during the Tet Offensive of the American War. The shell, napalm and bullet damage is still there to see.
Apart from that it is an important historical site. You do need a good guide though.
The standard tours in Hue take you to the Citadel anyway."
"Judging by the throne palace, which is one of the few remaining buildings, this place must have been amazing. Only built in the first two decades of the 19th century, it is quite a statement."
"The citadel palace complex is located on the North bank of Huong River (Perfume River) and is spectacular!
The Citadel Complex, set up by Nguyen Dynasty from 1805 to 1945, is a World Cultural Heritage Site and is in excellent condition with a system of three circles of ramparts. From outside to inside is Kinh Thanh (Capital Citadel), Hoang Thanh (Royal Citadel) and Tu Cam Thanh (Forbidden Citadel or Forbidden Purple City).

Only members of the royal family, the Emperor’s concubines, and trusted senior mandarins and officers such as the royal doctor were allowed through the sole entry gate of Tu Cam Thanh.

Less than a third of the structures inside the citadel remain. The French army shelled the building, and removed or destroyed nearly all the treasures it contained. Most of the buildings in the Forbidden City were destroyed by fire in 1947.

Further destruction occurred when Hue’s Citadel became the symbolic epicentre of the 1968 Tet Offensive. Major artillery battles were fought when the Viet Cong overran Hue and when the US forces finally recaptured the citadel 25 days later.

the Citadel is still imposing, and renovation work (which is ongoing) has restored several of its buildings to their previous glory. Don't miss this attraction!"
Great to wander around but to get the real benefit make sure you take a guided tour. Fascinating insight into Vietnamese history over the last 200 years.
"I felt very sad to realize that so much has been destroyed forever. Some building are just gone. Rebuilding will take a lifetime but will never recover the historical beauty of yesteryear. \I found the 9 bells after walking about for some long time..
I truly disliked not having a detailed map to follow a path so see what I hoped to see. I got lost quite a few times. Yet I didn't wish to listen to a tourguide for hours."
We toured around the outside of the Citadel and the gardens we saw were very impressive but the building itself is closed from 11 to after 1 so time your visit better than we did. It is one of the the highlights of Hue and you can get an impression of it with its moat and walls from outside.
"A fascinating day spent at the Citadel showed me what was, what could have been and what still might be. So much destruction at the hands of so many men of many nationalities. It would be amazing to see reconstruction occur in earnest to see the Citadel as it should be.

Even as it is, it is worth hours of one's day to explore. I cannot complain that this is ""not a top attraction"", since a war started by my country played a part in the destruction of at least part of the treasures of the Citadel. I believe that, even in its current state, it is one of Hue's treasures and is well worth a visit. I certainly plan to return the next time I am in Hue. And, I hope to see even more restoration work completed."
"It is interesting, but unfortunately much of it was damaged by the bombing in the 60""s. In my mind, there is a lot to be done before this can be considered a top attraction."
"This vast walled complex takes several hours to really explore fully, but a wander through even a half of it is a worthwhile experience. Some buildings, damaged by successive wars, are being currently renovated, others remain foundations, while some are fully restored and include displays and small museums. If you like to explore you have plenty of opportunities, and there are birds nesting in the moats, ducklings wandering in flocks of up to a 100 through courtyards, and koi fighting for bread dropped in for those who like to see some animal life as well. (Well the ducklings are probably not always there). One elephant also offers rides. A bit of culture and a lot of history in this medieval complex."
"Hue was part of my 3 weeks visit to Vietnam last January 2013. Along with the charming Hotel La Residence in Hue, I visited the Imperial City with a local guide who could not have been nicer and explained the history of this site very well. If in Hue, the Imperial City cannot be missed."
"you need to buy a 80000 d ticket which honestly, doesnt worth it. better to have little history knowledge before hand."
"We had limited time in Hue, but were very glad we spent the afternoon at the Citadel.
Its a huge site with quite a few areas to explore.
As we went late in the day we didn't have to contend with the crowds."
Very interesting and easy to walk around one of our most interesting days in Vietnam for our party of 12.
"Of course this has to be on your list of things to do in Hue.
A few tips:
Go late in the day. The crowds have diminished and the light is spectacular. It will take you about two hours to go through the grounds so allow enough time before the closing time of 5:30. Be sure to read literature online before you go so you fully appreciate what you're seeing.
If you plan to walk over (which you can) be ready for a typically adventurous walk (hone your street crossing skills). Also, be sure to map out your walking route using the satellite view to avoid the areas with narrow or nonexistent sidewalks."
This was an excellent chance to wander around and get a feel for The Old World of Vietnam. There was enough information but also a chance to be alone and absorb at your own pace. It was nice to be off the busy streets and wander. The film as you walk in is excellent.
"With the recent increases to entrance fees the citadel and tombs each cost 80, 000 dong($4). What many don't realize is that there are cheaper combination tickets available(How would tourists know when the signs are only in vietnamese and they dont mention them when you ask about other options...). Not to mention one person I asked said there aren't other options... Anyways, you can get ticket to citadel, khai dinh and minh mang for 180, 000 dong(Save $3) or citadel, tu duc, khai dinh and minh mang for 225, 000 dong(Save $5). Only hitch is that supposedly you have to use it all in one day(Could be true, who knows...). If you are doing a day tour to all these places and asked to pay entrance fees this is a good thing to know. Also all of these could easily be seen in one day by renting a scooter or if you are fit and up for a full day could use a bicycle. If they refuse point at the board beside office which is easy enough to decipher if you know about these deals."
It takes quite a while to see all of this huge site in a pleasant location. The buildings are being spectacularly resored after the wartime destruction. Recommended.
This was a well constructed city and many interesting aspects. The kings palace was most interesting.
"Despite being heavily bombed by the Americans there is still plenty to admire at this historic site. As you progress through the area, admiring the beautiful workmanship it is only when you approach the rear do you see the devastation inflicted by war."
Its being renovated and looking great - will be fabulous when finished. It looks as if they are going to keep the real historic nature of the place.
"Take hours to go around this royal citadel. In the days of old, it's like a smaller version of China's Forbidden City. Unfortunately, some of the structure had been damaged during many wars. However, those remain gives a good idea of what it must have been during the olden days.

A good stroll is needed to get a hold of the place. Also the outer walls surrounds the old city of Hue as vehicles goes in and out through out the day."
"Hue is a great place to see Vietnamese national pride and appreciate the history of a nation that has fought for independence for so long. The home of the kings of Vietnam during their period of independence is interesting to see. Much of it was destroyed during the wars, so they are in the process of restoring some of these buildings. We had a guide, which was great. Otherwise I'm not sure how easy it would be to understand what you're looking at. But it's definitely something to see!"
Great to wander around for a day but beware the Cyclo Men who hassle non stop and send you off in the wrong direction
"Much of this complex was destroyed in the Battle of Hue in the Vietnam War when the US felt itself forced to abandon the policy of not targeting cultural sites after the NVA had occupied the Citadel. A real shame because this is truly an amazing place which is now painstakingly being rebuilt. We walked here from the center of Hue, about 30 minutes. The Citadel itself is larger than one thinks but there is plenty of opportunity to sit down and reflect. Take your time but you should be able to see it all in under two hours."
A facinating visit to a magnificent monument. It really is ashame so many buildings were bombed in the war but work is well underway to reintate the city to its former glory.
There are an awful lot of temples and the palace reconstructions get to be samey. It is the recent history that makes it interesting.
We were really interested in going here and though it was great. A lot of it has been destroyed by war and they are slowly rebuilding it. I will definitely return in years to come to see the finished product. But a great place to visit as it has allot of history.
"It is an amazing complex. The purple Forbidden City was destroyed twice by war but it is still a high point of visiting Vietnam. Go early in the morning and wander in the buildings, galleries and gardens."
"Hue Imperial City (The Citadel) is an interesting cultural site to visit in the city. We had a minor problem with tickets - were short changed, but got it resolved. The area is still under some reconstruction and has been improved a lot since our last visit in 2009. Much of it was destroyed 45 years ago and is still being brought back to its historic condition."
"I will make this short. Go! Very impressive. Why wouldn't you! The images of an emperor his court, the audiences that he received kept my imagination going long after I left. The grand life style of an emperor. It is a history lesson not too be missed."
"So Hue is really just a stop over town. And this is really the only attraction. We spent about 1.5 hours here which I thought was plenty. Enough to get a general idea and take some photos. Overall compared to other sites in Vietnam, average."
"warning-do not use the green electric carts located by the elephant. We arrived at the citadel late in the day, and because it's so big we decided to use the electric carts. We thought the driver would be a driver/guide for the price we paid (150,000 vnd/per person- for 5 people). It was a joke, the driver pulled up to the entrance of the first site, said 5 minutes, the drove away. He couldn't speak english. He drove us to two more sites, said 5 minutes at each one, then dropped us off after 25 mins, and drove away! We definatley got ripped off! My advice would be to book a guide before you go to the site."
Although still being restored this provided an idea into the way the Vietnamese royalty lived. Generally calm and peaceful and good to walk around at leisure.
"Nice to see the many different buildings and take photographs, but I found the tour with our guide a bit 'long winded' and many people, including me, wandered off to take photographs."
"this is my first time to visit Hue , and comeback to the historical places where i had learned from the school . I like it"
"huge site, some of it beautifully restored some of it in the process of being restored and some of it left as it was after the war. Take a fully charged up camera and your walking feet."
"I went to the Royal Citadel in the morning when there is still plenty of shade and it is not too hot. I thought the buildings were average and there were some nice ruins but I also thought you would be able to see a lot more than you could. There is the touristy shop (where things are expensive) and a set of toilets etc. Walking from the town is advised since its not far away at all, we biked and they charged a small fortune to park them out front and 'watch' them for us."
"Took us about 3 hours to see everything but that included us not knowing what parts were worth seeing and checking out every corner. Tours take about an hour and only take you to the renovated areas. Since most of the imperial city was bombed to smithereens during the Vietnam war, most of the buildings still lay in ruins and the city is slowly renovating it (But this is at its infancy stages) so a tour may be more useful. The areas that have completed renovation are the Ngo Mon Gate, Thai Hoa Palace, Left and Right house (used as souvenir shops), the theater, most of the queen mother's quarters, and the Mieu. There were a few (~4) other temples and buildings that were competed but didn't have an English name. The gardens are partially completed and nice for a quiet stroll as we were the only ones there. The rest is either in renovation or lays in ruin. The Royal Reading Pavilion is completely in renovation. No photos are allowed indoors and the entrance was 80,000 VND."
The Citadel is clearly the highlight of Hue. There seemed to have been very slow restoration after the war and one can only imagine it's original glory. We were told that it was designed somewhat based on the Forbidden City which is certainly a lot more more impressive.
"One is the imperial history, and the other is the most recent Battle of Hue, which destroyed a lot of the Citadel. It is amazing to be in a place that has such a glorious and yet sad past."
"just another temple, well desmolished that one. it was ok but definetely not a must see, hue in itself wasnt a great stop"
far too much money to get in and you deffo need a tour guide to get the most out of this site. Most of it is newly built but they are building them to show what it was like before it was destroyed during the war so dont expect old old buildings - it's new and ruins together
"Too bad it's been bombed into oblivion or so it seems. Not the Quang Tri way but still, it takes a trip and a walk to come see The Citadel and once you're there you realise there's little left of what was. OK, you may indulge in dressing up like an emperor or look at what would've been, if the Tet offensive, the Vietnam War, the oil reserves.... Made me sad."
Was interesting but rather run down. Probably needed a tour guide to explain the history of it coz many places were not properly signed. For 80vnd it was ok.
"So much history and culture to see. Amazingly big once you enter. Try the traditional costumes for your very own photo shoot on the throne, don't pay for the extra make-up though, a wipe of foundation and a lick of lipstick wasn't worth the money."
"The Citadel, the inner part of the 4 square kilometer Imperial City of Hue, should certainly be visited despite the extensive destruction caused during the battle during the Tet offensive in 1968 and the subsequent neglect of this site by successive Vietnamese governments. What remains is a fraction of what was once there and while some of the original Imperial quarters have been renovated, many of the buildings will always be incomplete. It is a bit of curiosity, moreover, because it is a 19th and early 20th century construction by the Nguyen dynasty (1802-1945) not, as one might have imagined from the style and appearance of the remaining buildings, an early modern or even medieval structure. Renovations are taking place, albeit slowly, in several parts of the Citadel and one does get some insight into the kind of lifestyle the Nguyen Emperors enjoyed. On the other hand, the extensive damage and rubble does detract a little from the experience - one has to use one's imagination more than, say, in Angkor in Cambodia. IN short the Citadel has to be seen to be believed - scale, ambition, extravagance and ostentatious style. And, of course, it is a reminder of the damage that war creates. Be prepared to walk a good deal between the outer gates and the buildings (though you can ride an elephant within the grounds!) and above all don't expect this to be like the Forbidden City in Beijing on which it is modelled - a totally different experience but worthwhile nonetheless."
Go by yourself. It's walking distance from Hue and if you take a tour you won't have nearly enough time to see what this place has to offer. It's a wonderful mix of restored and unrestored buildings. You can see the restoration efforts in action!
"This is a fairly young complex on Asian standards. It is sad to see the damages done during the Vietnam war. They are rebuilding and restoring, it is and will be a fascinating place to visit. A must in Hué!"
Citadel interesting but surrounding area inside the city walls a bit dull and grey.Market just outside city walls very interesting.
"This World Heritage listed site is a must see even if you are short on for time. This fortess consists of three separate but concentric areas all of which are enclosed by an outer wall almost 10Km long and constructed of hand made bricks. The wall is surrounded by a moat. Inside this outer defence is the Imperial City which is itself enclosed by a moat and walls then there is the inner sanctum, the Forbidden ( Purple ) City which was the emperors own domain.
Sadly a significant part of this fabulous complex has been damaged by wars, and the humidity and termites are making the daunting task of restoration a major exercise.
I would suggest that if you go there you arrange a guide who is familiar with the site otherwise you will miss the significance of much of the area and its history."
The size of the complex for just one family and adherents was a bit overwhelming to take in. Liked seeing another bit of Vietnam's history
"really interesting and lot's to see. However, not sure about rebuilding what it used to look like... it is in danger of becoming more like and experience than a real piece of history."
We lucked out visting the Citadel even though it was raining. We were approachd by Tran Van Thinh on a tuk tuk who showed us around with great enthusiasm and love. If you visit here be sure to seek him out.
"The sheer size of the site, from the impressive gate entrance to the theatre, the library (being restored), the audience hall was remarkable. I would recommend a guide, people on their own were looking lost as there is not much signposting or printed information. We had Mr Vu who was excellent."
"This is the large walled palace of the emperors, very impressive but largely damaged and in disrepair. Parts are being renovated and parts have been done, so you get a feel for how it must have been."
"This is a must to do. The mere size and the historical grandeur of this place, before it was bombed during senseless wars, is amazing. This being declared a World Heritage site and money now being spend to restore various parts of it is wonderful as this place must have been amazing. The history, the legacy is amazing. This is a must when visiting Hue."
It was great to spend a morning looking at the old buildings and imagining what it must have been like to live there. The colours are amazing and it's good to see the restoration taking place. It's quite a lot of walking so I'd recommend getting a taxi/cyclo there.
"A visit here is quite spectacular, we were fortunate that the weather was wonderful. You can easily spend two hours walking the interior, with lots of photo opportunities - building up an appetite for lunch."
"You can only imagine how grand this citadel must have been in its day, but you can easily spend hours leisurely roaming the beautiful grounds today. We visited during an off season and had very few crowds to contend with. Good mix of ruin and restored to allow visitors the ability to appreciate the skill and time it must have taken during original building. Just beautiful."
"In the afternoon the site is not so crowded (if you go in high season... and the colours are very nice.
In the cite there is not much to see, the best are the tombs on the far left after the first main building (go there first) then come back and finish the tour with the forbidden city where there is not much to see.
Consider that you can go out of the city in the opposite way you entered so you can look at both sides (zigzagging) till the end and then go out instead of doing a ""circle"" tour of the site.
Great light at dusk.
Consider a 2 hour visit."
"it is quite big; most of the buildings are restored, some are under restoration and some are still ruins.
there are some interesting places to see, but it gets a little repetitive after some time."
"Hue's Citadel is a large walled area on the north side of the river. We did a lot of walking as the grounds are large.They are restoring and the gold and red painted areas are lovely, it would have been beautifull in its day"
The entire comples occupies 6 square kilometres. It has outer walls 21 metres thick and seven sections linked by lovely boulevards shaded be large trees. All this made for a very peaceful setting since there is so much room to spread the tourists out in.
"Learn from our mistake. We didn't do enough research and so in our very short time at the Citadel, we hired a cyclo driver to take us around thinking it would be quicker. We were taken through lots of dirty streets we had seen the likes of before and were left with only 15 minutes in the Imperial City which is the only part you really need to see.
We were kicking ourselves!"
"Vietnam's answer to China's Forbidden City. Amazing architecture and mere size is astounding, Great history and fabulous guide."
Amazing to see what might have been without the destruction during the war. Still some amazing buildings but so much razed to the ground.
So much history!! If only the walls could talk! Our guide provided us with background information that made our visit memorable.
"As most of the buildings have been destroyed it was not like I was expecting. Not really worth the trip to Hue which is far away from everything else, unfortunately."
"i stayed at the backpackers alley close to the perfume river. from my hostel i walked across the
trang tien bridge and immediately after the bridge, turned left , the view of the citadel wall and the tall flag pole was visible. just continue to the entrance bought the entrance ticket and explored the citadel to my heart's content. i spent half a day there. its an impressive masterpiece. sadly, some of the main structures were destroyed by bombings during the war. its a worthwhile place to explore and for photography."
"We were transported to another world, time and place, all of it good. I will forever remember this place, the serenity and tranquility on my return home."
"Although not in the best maintenance state, the site allows imagning the past splendor of this old imperial city.
A must-see in Hue."
"You can truely imagine how lavish this was before it was bombed and damaged. It is a huge area and very interesting. I think more information panels would have been great explaining the area. But then most groups have a tour guide. Some renovation taking place.

Its definitely worth visiting and is such a huge part of Vietnams history."
Thoroughly enjoyed the trip here and listening to the stories of the past. Hard to imagine what life must have been like. Despite being heavily damaged in the war major restoration is underway - although we liked the damaged areas just as much. Particulary like how life goes on within and around the citadel. We definitely didn't allow long enough (1.5 hours) but can recommend the tour. Get in early coz it seems to get busy.
"People visiting Hue naturally visit the Citadel. It is interesting and the video showing what it would have looked like in its day was great. My kids had fun dressing up in the emperor clothing for a cheesy photo.

My tip is to beware of the cyclo drivers. We were badly caught. We accepted a lift to the citadel and had agreed on a price. Once we got to the citadel they told us not to pay, that they would wait for us and we could then decide if we wanted a further ride. That was stupid of us. Once we returned from the citadel they were very friendly and offered to drive us back to the hotel via a few tourist sites. We thought we had agreed on a price. After the first stop on the way back we bought up the topic of how much again and that's when things went bad. All of a sudden they were demanding $100 per cyclo. They were claiming the price was per person not per cyclo. There was no way that we were going to pay that so then they did not want to take us back to the hotel. Negotiations became very unpleasant with the cyclo driver becoming increasingly aggressive. In the end he took us back to the hotel and we paid $25 which is a total rip off but by that stage I was not certain that he would not hit my husband. I just wanted to leave and get away. I must say it was the only negative experience we had in our 2 week visit to Vietnam and I acknowlege that we were stupid to let the drivers wait for us whilst we were at the Citadel. We did use cyclo's in other parts of Vietnam and had no problems. However after that experience, whenever we used a cyclo or tuk tuk we always wrote down the agreed price on a piece of paper and showed it to them so that we were all certain of the agreement."
"A big place and we did spent a few hours with our excellent tour guide (nickname 'Papaya') who explained a lot of the history and significance of the place. Without her explanation it can be meaningless to anyone who just walks around. The place is still undergoing restoration, so there are parts of buildings that are totally destroyed and parts freshly painted."
"It's beautiful! To fully appreciate it, try getting a ride on the horse carriage around the facility, climb the elephant, and dress up in emperor clothing for photos."
"The Citadel is impressive...when you see what it used to be and what it hopefully will be one day again. For the time being though, disappointingly there's not all that much to see. It's heartbreaking that such a beautiful complex was destroyed by war but I look forward to visiting again once more of the rebuilding project has been completed to restore this important Vietnamese treasure."
This is a must see as far as I'm concerned - I don't think you've experienced Hue without it. There is plenty to see and learn - the presentation is well done with models and video constructions showing past and present. The renovations seem to be being done well which is encouraging.
"We chose to just explore the west gate quarter because of its size, very well restored and ongoing works but a good impression of how the city worked, beautiful timber palaces, we had a very capable guide which helped a lot."
The Citadel was very interesting (we had our own guide) and a must see in Hue. It will be fantastic when it has been fully restored.
"Lots of ongoing and unfinished work. Huge potential, but It could be so much more. left feeling like we visited an unfinished construction site."
The complex is quiet huge and has lots of interesting things to see. Some areas are being renovated but there is a lot to keep you interested and quite a lot of history
Great photo opportunity .... They are in the process of renovating the site albeit slowly so some parts lack attention but in some ways this can have its own beauty. not to expensive to get in which is alway a bonus.
"The Citadel is the site where the Emperor lived back in the day. It is also part of American history as the army fought the Viet Cong in a pitched battle during the Tet Offensive of 1968. For that reason, it is well worth a visit to see what our 19 year old Fathers and Uncles had to endure

The Citadel is a beautiful spread of buildings...and is almost impossible to capture without great human cost...You can still see the bullet holes in the walls"
"Our local guide was able to explain the significance and history of this vast complex. Restoration is being done slowly, with some areas pretty much completed and others yet to start. The size and scale needs to be seen first hand to appreciate it."
"great bike ride distance from Vina Hotel (20 min) - we spent a couple of hours wandering around. It was more interesting than I expected - beautiful and in process of being restored from American bombing. there is a great cafe, built into the northern section of the wall, over looking a neighborhood of the city that is a great place to sit and relax after walking around the Citadel"
"Definitely a must-see in Hue. Major face uplifted reconstruction is being carried out at the various part of the imperial city during my visit. Nevertheless, the place was still filled with visitors with some eager to dress up like royals in the past! Peaceful and tranquil to walk around or just sit enjoy the breeze. Impressive architectures, with beautiful carvings. Entrance fee: 80,000 dong per adult."
I can not help comparing it to the Forbidden City in Beijing and they are surely related. This is the way nicer place of the two.
"The Citadel, is a very large walled area on the north side of the Perfume River - 10 km. It is one of Vietnam's five UNESCO World Cultural Heritage sites. It's a good idea to begin your tour in the morning when the sun and weather is not very hot. A bicycle is a nice way to tour this very large area. However, we hired a cyclo but be careful about negotiating the rate. Too many cyclo drivers use a scam showing you a map and telling you that you'll see everything in a half hour for a flat half hour rate. Do not fall for the scam. It can take up to 2 hours to see everything excluding the Imperial City. The Imperial City you should do separately. So, select the sites you want to see on the cyclo driver's map and negotiate a flat rate for 2 hours. We had to negotiate hard with a cyclo driver for a flat rate at $US3.50 an hour or 70,000 VND for one cyclo - both my wife and I seated in the trishaw to see: The home of Ho Chi Minh's parents and several Temples. End you cyclo tour at the Imperial City. Then, it's a short walk where all the cyclo drivers park because they are not permitted on the Imperial City grounds. Admission is 80,000 per person ($US4.00). Allow about 1 1/2 hours to see everything and take a lot of photos. There's reconstruction ongoing but there is a lot of the old historical city to see. It is almost 2.5 kilometers - inside the Imperial City enclosure once titled the Purple Forbidden City that was reserved for the Nguyễn imperial family ."
The main reason to come to Hue. It is constructed following t he Beijing imperial city model but surrounded by fortification like french castle/ citadel. One day in Hue is enough for the citadel and the tombs.
we spent 2-2.5 hours here- aboslutely beautiful despite the destruction by wars. There's a lot to see in the complex so would advise to take your time.
very impressed with the vast area and the scale of the Citadel.We could spent whole day there. A lot of renovation and restoration is needed.
"Worth a trip, especially if you have been to the Forbidden City in Beijing. They are both built in a similar way and it is good to make the comparison particularly as the Citidel is still very much a restoration work in progress."
"Not as impressive as Bejing's Forbidden City, but close. Give visitors an appreciation for last 200 years of Vietnam's history. Many years still needed to replace and repair what bombs and age have worn away."
"There is a lot to see in the citadel, and is well worth the price you pay to get in (despite being several fold more than the locals). Give yourself most of the day for this and you really get a lot out of it. There are plenty of little signs that give you snippets of information about the place.

Make sure you bring food and a poncho, cause apart from a few little drink stalls theres not much else in that regard."
Although the imperial city (citadel) is one of the main attractions in Hue it was a real surprise once you are inside - the sheer scale of the place is hard to comprehend. Unfortunately alot of it was destroyed through bombing in the war but vast efforts are ongoing to rebuild it to its former glory and the reconstructed buildings/temples/pagodas etc.. that have completed are breathtaking in their detail. Well worth visiting!
"Not very interesting, building works going on to renovate old buildings would have proffered to see them restore"
"A trip across the river from the bustle of Hue allows your imagination to step back 150 years to the time that kings (and later France) ruled Vietnam. You can picture how the leaders led their lives surrounded by the opulence of their position. Make sure you have a local guide to tell you the ""inside"" information of the forbidden city. This is a 2-3 hour visit that is a must if you are in Hue."
"The Citadel is perhaps Hue's headliner attraction, and very deserving. Reminiscent on a far smaller scale of Beijing's Forbidden City, it is a fascinating look at the imperial era.

One needs to keep in mind that the Citadel was mostly destroyed in the intense fighting that took place here duirng Tet, 1968. Most of what you see is restored, and massive restoration work is still under way. The work done to date is of a high calibre.

But much of this complex is still a wasteland of flattened walls and blasted buildings, often overgrown with grass and weeds. It doesn't get nearly as much attention ffrom tourists as the restored sections. Yet these are many of the Citadel's most evocative and atmospheric places. If you have an eye for the romance of ruins, definitely allocate time to get off the main tour paths and wander on your own through these unrestored areas."
"Partly restaurated we preferred the old part which is more authentic.

The first few buildings of the imperial city are clearly aiming at tourists and offer souvenir shops and photo opportunities in traditional costumes (for a small fee).

when you proceed a bit further you can currently see renovations underway, but we still liked that part a lot better cause the worn out buildings and faded paintings seem to transfer you straight back to old emperors days...

DO: Feed the Koi fish in the pond near the entrance and see what happens :)
DON`T: there`s a little restaurant next to the main hall, the fresh coconuts are nice but don`t use ice in any of your drinks... we saw how it was made..."
"Would be beautiful once completed! At the moment, it's being restored bit by bit. Still worth a look."
This is the ancient King's Palace and a must see in Hue. They kept the antiquity of the Imperial City in great condition.
Visioning what the citadel looked like in its day shows the immense wealth that existed during the imperial days. Unfortunately a lot of visioning is still required. A lot of repairs are still underway. The quality of repairs that have been completed are amazing. It still should be on everyones list of top things to do in Hue.
"Although it is badly restored, the place is amazing. But it still needs some work to become a important place to visit in Vietname"
The citadel was nice to stroll around in and it was cool to see the large fish in the ponds inside the entrance however unless history and buildings interest you I wouldn't go there.
"It was very big and that meant lots of walking.
But the history of this place is tremendous.
Bring lot's of water and an extra memory card for your camera."
"My husband and i spent half a day looking arount the citadel. We had a wonderful time learning and reading about the ancient ways of the past in Vietnam. It is being gradually restored due to damage from the wars. In its day it would have been a fabulously opulent walled city, and you can definitely use your imagination and relive this as you walk around.A definite must wheile in Hue."
A large complex with many similar structures. Easy to get lost- there are no clear instructions about how to make ones way around and little written information about the complex. Do watch the video at the entrance for some information. If you only have a short while here see the tombs instead- much better.
Part of the Hue experience. You'd be a fool to miss it but have a guide with you to explain the history. (Visited Sept 2011)
"雖然門票要80000越南盾，不過裡面算蠻大的，建築物也都很美麗，很有歷史的美感。
位置也在市中心，走路就可以到了。來到順化可以去看看!

Its a historical palace, beautiful buildings and very big area. The price was a little bit high, but it was all right I say."
"The Citadel was built in the early 1800s and has unfortunately decayed greatly over the years. However, it is being slowly restored and is definitely worth a visit. The complex covers many acres where elephants seem to be the lawn mowers. The emperor's throne room and other rooms were extravagantly decorated, and some of the original costumes are still on display."
We visited the citadel after going to the tombs on a city tour and it was kind of disappointing after seeing those. It was still cool but I'm sure it would have been much nicer if part of it hadn't been destroyed during the war. Still worthwhile though
"This place is a stark reminder of how mindless bombing can do to destroy excellent pieces of work, construction and artefacts. While most of the Citadel grounds are gone, some of the foundations remain. The Royal Theatre is the only remaining complete building apart from the Noon Gate (similar to the Meridian gate at Beijing). While we were there, there was a large Samsung tv showing a digitized reconstruction of the entire Citadel done by some Koreans. Excellent place to learn about history."
"Take the time to walk around and visit. It's quite impressive.
After this the tombs visits looses a bit of its grandeur.
Would definitely recommend getting a guide for full enjoyment of the site.
And i'd recommend the authorities to charge more, guys, sorry to say that but you're not charging enough. Don't be shy. And you need the money to restore the place."
"We were lucky to come in a and miss out on the flock of tourists that were about to enter. It is a nice piece of history, we explored the the citadel by ourselves but I think it would have been nicer to have a guide just to get some more information about the history and structures.

Whilst we were there the citadel is being refurbished and rebuilt to what it would have looked like back in the day. I say whats it is done it'll be a magnificent site! Though the Ruins that are standing now are magnificent themselves.

If you do decide to go i suggest getting a guide who knows what they are talking about that way you get full knowledge on it."
"I like old structures, so this was the highlight of our visit to Hue for me.

Read up on it first, take a camera and discover it yourself. We didn't go with a guide, we read up on the history, then walked around with our cameras. It is huge. We spent about 4.5 hours in there and we were nowhere near done, I could have easily returned the next day and spent a full day AND still discover new ruins. It is a photographers dream.

Go early. In the late afternoon, it will feel like every tourist in town is in there and in all your frames. Also, go to the loo at your hotel first unless you are easy-going about toilet conditions...."
"Being the first imperial city i have visited i found the history interesting. It would have been nice to go with a guide to have more information. Although there was construction and restoration on many of the buildings you get a good overview of what it use to look like before war and natural disaster. Will be great in a few years time. It cost 80,000 dong entry and you could spend around an hour walking through the buildings. They do have an opera, dance and folk theatre show with various sessions throughout the day. Unfortunately this was not running on the day we went but i imagine it would be worth checking out."
"Don't get me wrong, this is definitely worth a visit now, but it's definitely still in need of lots of works after all the damage in the war/due to neglect. It's pretty interesting to see some of the fantastic restoration work in progress, but like I say - in ten years or so it will be really amazing!"
"The imperial city was fairly large and the grounds were clean. I would have preferred more English signage or maybe it would be better to go with a guide, but you can very easily spend an hour walking the grounds visiting the site.

If you've been to an imperial city before, for example, in Beijing, then it's less interesting, because the architecture seems similar."
"While staying in Hue city and not far from the River I decided that I would hire a ""Cyclo"" for the day and visit the Citadel located just across on the other side of the Perfumed River..The cyclo was a good choice and just so easy to get around in and also inexpensive...I worked out a price for the Cyclo and Driver before setting off as I wanted him to wait for me while I visited this huge complex...The Citadel..This is a city within a city and is in many places still being rebuilt even after the many years after so much destruction. This is really worth the day 's visit..a UNESCO World Heritage site."
The Citadel is enormous and is made up of a large number of separate building of various ages and states of repair. It was interesting but would have been more so with a guide book and map of the site.
"The majority of the Citadel is being rebuilt after being bombed and neglected for some time, but will be phenomenal once it's completed. The works in progress don't hamper the experience of the Citadel as it stands now, and I would definitely recommend visiting the Citadel while in Hue."
A huge expansive place that is under repair/renovation from being neglected over times. Hope to see it again in a couple years as to how the country treat this site.
"Very different from China's Forbidden City. Be sure to spend the time to walk to the rear of the complex. While some buildings were bombed out of existence during the Vietnam war, the rear of the complex has lovely gates and buildings. Avoid the anti-american 'skew' of the guides and just walk thru on your own. A must see on your trip to Vietnam. Do not let a guide cut short your exploration; ours wanted us to focus on the empty patch that was the library (bombed out of existence) and we had to come back on our own to discover the beauty that is here."
"Much smaller, damaged during the war. Dates from 19th century. The grounds are in poor condition, very uneven pavements. A long walk to get to the entrance."
"You need to read up about this place inorder to really understand and appreciate it.
So do some homework before you visit this place. Plenty of information in the internet and books. Otherwise get a guide to explain regarding the history, architecture of the temples, palaces and other buildings etc.

The back portion is still under heavy renovation and restoration perhaps due to the damage done during Tet Offensive 1968.

Other historical sites ( museum, temples, Ho Chi Min's cottage etc )around the old city are worth spending some time too if you are fit enough to walk for hours. Otherwise get a trishaw and the man may even serve as your tourist guide if you are lucky to get one who is good in English. Remember to Negotiate for the price first on hourly basis. They will usually charge by hourly basis, so be prepared to pay more if you exceed the time.

A must see in Hue."
"You need a guide to talk you through the role that Hue played, but it is a great place to understand how France maintained the puppet government and how general government and administration was maintained throughout the country"
Hue Imperial city was very worthwhile visiting - a written information pamphlet or even a sight map would be helpful for those without a guide.
"It's the first time we visited a old imperial building in Vietname. The grounds of the Imperial City were surrounded by a wall and moat. Just inside the gate is a lotus pond with a bridge once reserved for the emperor's private use. This palace still remained its form of City under Middle Age and the constructions of monarchic, a invaluable museum of Vietnam. Amazing, fantastic and memnorable, Steve and I really enjoyed the holiday - that's a good adventure to me!"
"Extensive site to visit, took us a couple of hours to walk around. Lots of renovation going on so you can compare old and new"
worth spending a good amount of time in the imperial city. Look at the reconstruction project and understand the history behind the Citadel. Great photo opps.
"Upon entering the Citadel Gate, you will already get a feel of how grand the Imperial City is. I love the architectural design and even with a lot of the buildings destroyed by war, you can still get a feel of how beautiful and majestic this place is. I personally loved the Palace of Supreme Harmony. I am glad to see a lot of renovations ongoing so maybe the next time I visit this place, it will been restored to its old grandeur. It's a must see!"
"Although there is only a fraction of the buildings left, those that remain and the plans and video give you a good insight into what was once an amazing palace and city.
Renovation work is ongoing and there will be more to see in the future.
Costs 80,000 Dong to go in but this is $4 or less then £3 and the money goes towards renovation and upkeep."
What an absolutely amazing place...Do not miss going to this and make sure you take your camera. When you pay to go in you should see like larger versions of golf carts...this place is so large that it is worth the money to get them to drive you around & they will stop at points of interest or when you ask them to.
"This is the must see tourist attraction , wether its for the history or buildings its a must , so much to see so take a hat and sun cream"
"This place is beautiful, from temple to temple, the citadel is huge! The history of Vietnam is, the former imperial city, it is very well preserved. The architecture and colors make the place magical. I have a big preference for the view of the library through the doors of one of the buildings right on the way. The building is bright red and gold, and through the doors we can perceive the library which is superb. I highly recommend a visit to the citadel, a must not to miss!"
This is a huge complex so be prepared for a bit of walking and make sure you have lots of water. The scale of the original structure though not as large as the forbidden city in China is just as impressive but unfortunately though it was only built in the 19th Century it suffered a lot of damage during the war and the ongoing restoration work is to be commended. A must see for any visitor
Take a cyclo ride to the Old Citadel and then take your time to explore the old Citadel - so many fantastic oppportunities for photographing. Look for the weird angles and shadows. Built by the Nguyen dynasty it is allegedly an exact copy of The Forbidden City in Beijing. I took time exploring the moats and the carp are enormous. Yes it is being restored folloig the tet Offensive but there is still so muh to wonder at
"There are some nice portals and a couple of interesting buildings, but it breaks anyone's heart to see them spending the money to renew the tennis court, ie, to build a brand new tennis court inside the complex for the use of a few well connected people, whilst other really historic buildings are decaying."
"Interesting to look around. Make sure you use the front entrance near the flag tower or you could be fooled into thinking the citadel is closed if you just walk around the outside (as we almost were). They are in the process of restoring the site as it was destroyed by fire and war, so some parts are a bit run down. Still interesting to explore."
"Thick walls, moats ,huge hungry carp. Impressive Imperial enclosure. Read Lonely Planet or other guide before you go to understand function of component parts. Be prepared for a lot of walking- take it slowly in heat/humidity."
A lot of the city was destroyed during the war but there is still plenty to see and explore. The site is slwly being restored to its former glory. A very impressive place.
"A great piece of ancient architecture, well worth a visit. Be very careful as you have to get ther by walking through a tunnell with very little pavement, the traffic is very near you. You have to run the gauntlet of hawkers entering and leaving."
Sadly my touring of Hue was washed out with torrential rain leading to flooding over 50cm deep in some parts. It made walking around too unpleasant even with wet weather gear. The old city looks really interesting but I will have to go again.
"A must-visit if you arrive in Hue. Enjoy your journey in the past, you will amazed by the history of the Vietnam dynasty, just like somewhere else in the east."
"The Citadel in Hue is an enormous complex of buildings and water features dating back through the Nguyen dynasty. It take a good half day to walk around and see the numerous palaces, buildings, gardens and water features. It is good to take a hand book or guide to explain the history and also take you through the recent and ongoing renovations, which are extensive and incredible quality. A thoroughly recommended interesting day out."
We did this as part of a tour that also included a Cyclo ride and lunch at a restaurant in Hue. The Citadel is an excellent site and is in the process of being renovated with Unesco funding. The Citadel was damaged in the war and had not had money spent on it until recent times. The Pagoda's and buildings are find examples and are being beautifully restored. Well worth a visit.
"The Citadel was a good place to go for an of hours or to kill sometime. It was hard for us to appreciate the Citadel because we had just been to the Forbidden City in China.

It was much smaller in scale and a lot of it is still in ruins from the Vietnam War. While we were there restoration was happening the buildings, but a lot of work still needs to be completed.

It was good to see the history.

There was an entrance fee."
"We rented a bycicle to get from our hotel to the Imperial City, a very good way to travel and see the sights around Hue. The Citadel itself is nice, but not a vacation highlight. A lot of it was destroyed during the Vietnam war when the US battled the VC on the grounds of the complex.

A lot of effort is currently put in rebuilding the complex and some sites are still intact. A nice video shows the history and how the entire complex looked like before the destruction."
"it gets busy here and traffic through the one way gates can get a little full on. but it is a beautiful area with a rich history, a must see in Hue"
"we were cheated by the girl selling entrance tickets. i handed over 200k Dong (tickets for 2 pax is 160k Dong) and the girl quickly change one piece of 100k note to 10k note from her drawer while i was not noticed it. She told me i should pay the 160k and waving the 110k to me. i was not expected this can happen and give her another 50k. we found out later when my wife told me she clearly see that i gave her 200k. we then recount our money and found that she cheat us. i mean we dont mind to pay more for this UNESCO heritage but cheating happened in these place is really bad. i was careless but i hope others be careful.
."
"Allow yourself a few hours to get the most from this experience. A great sense of history and some of it very recent brings this location to life. Just wander and enjoy the ambience, a guide is really essential we thought. You can walk around without being pestered to buy stuff which is another plus point. Nothing really to dislike with this visit just so much to se and do, enjoy."
"A must see when visiting Hue. A large ancient walled complex with gates on 4 sides and a moat all the way around. With in these walls lies the Forbidden purple city which was the home of the Nuygen Ruling Dynasty, Take the time to absorb the history and tradition of this place as if gives an insight into some of the roots of modern day Vietnam. A lot of restoration work is going on and as others have commented a lot was destroyed during the war."
"This citadel was the site of a very large battle where the USA troops regained the city from Viet Cong during the war. Still in the process of being restored, top marks to the authorities, this edifice is huge and very impressive. What a shame that it had to be nearly obliterated in the first place!"
Relaxing place and we have many photos captured here. The Ngo gate is repairing so we cannot go up and see around. It is good place for understanding Vietnam history.
"We spent a few hours walking around the Citadel taking in all the architecture and reading about the history of the emperors.

Don't miss the few buildings on the left side (as you enter) as these could be easily missed."
"We really enjoyed the Citadel. It was a super hot day, so we made it a half day trip, but that was all we really needed. Take sunscreen or a parasol and lots of water. My husband and son rode the elephant"
"We spent a few hours exploring the Imperial City/Enclosure and found it to be quite fascinating. The walled city is a big area to explore and the buildings vary greatly in condition, but if you have the time it is well worth trying to cover as much as possible and not just the main buildings inside the gate. Some of the areas toward the back of the city are being restored, some are intact and some are ruins but there were few tourists in these areas when we visited which was a bonus from my point of view, but also a pity as these were the areas that I found most interesting and most enjoyed."
"Very interesting, the history of the Nguyen Dynasty, the construction of the Imperial City or Citadel and its destruction (not complete of course) during the Vietnam war. Well worth a visit."
Great site to visit. Very large scale with many different building complexes. You need a guide to understand and appreciate it. Your hotel will have a recommended one. Take good sun protection as you need to walk quite long distances in the sun to cover all the interesting parts of this complex. A sunhat and umbrella is not too much.
It is a wide open space with buildings that date well back and the history is all there - one of the to do things in Hue
I spent 5 hours in the citadel and palace exploring. Very interesting. The buildings and temples that are standing are lovely
"The citadel is a must see for Hue. It is fairly vast and some bits are a bit worse for wear, but they are doing it up,so some places have scaffolding. Try and walk round the whole citadel as some of the buildings are away from the central square. You do get hassled outside by the cyclo riders but just say no firmly and keep walking if you're not interested."
It's a shame that so much of the imperial city was damaged during the 2nd. Still a good sample of the old monarchy and they are working on restoring things.
"Lovely walled city, with some beautiful structures and some interesting peices of history. Nice to be able to stroll around the area with limited vehicle access."
"The Citadel and imperial city was heavily destroyed by US bombs - what is left only makes you hungry to be able to see the original size & colours. A pictoresque imagination will by handy, since not all is restored yet - not to say, that restoration goes slowly. It is supposed to finish 2035. Think of postponing untill than... :)
Other that that - a very interesting site."
"Actually more than half. The problem with hue s citadel is that whats left of it isnt very much. Its still worth the visit though. The walls, the gates and some palaces and temples are well restored and are great, but there is a lot of empty space out there that kind of messes up the expectations I had from reading on the guide book and tourist info. The city is great nonetheless and worth A visit by itself."
Interesting insight into old Vietnamese culture and a reminder of the recent turbulent history of the country. The restoration is impressive and the contrast between what has been restored and still needing work is an eyeopener.
"The forbidden city (bombed by the Americans and now restored) is worth a visit. It is a vast area, the remaining and restored buildings give a good impression of the splendour it once had."
"Well worth the time, its wonderful to see the site being restored and would have loved to have spent more time just taking in the atmosphere"
"There is not much documentation available about the site on site. I would recommend taking a local guide for this. Our guide was very good as helping us visualize what the city was like when it was initially built, he made the whole experience very lively."
"This place repays the time and effort wandering around the whole area, not just the main attractions ,,, very much a work in progress ... the performance in the theatre is well worth watching if you are not in a hurry."
"Loved the citadel, the day we went was one of the hottest of our whole trip which meant the going was very slow, but this was ok, as it meant we got to savour some of the amazing architecture and spend time just enjoying the surroundings!"
"You cannot go to Hue and not see this ancient city. You can walk around and investigate the many intricate parts of the city for yourself or go for one of the many tour options. We enjoyed exploring the city on our own, wandering at our own pace. The city is enormous, so you need to allow plenty of time to see it. It is a beautiful historical place. Even if you don't have a great deal of time in Hue, try to see the Citadel, take a tour. It is the old capital. Don't miss it!"
"Not much left of the Citadel and the place never really gripped me.

Watch out they dont cheat you on the entrance fee."
"A must-see in Hué. Reserve at least a half day for it. The area id very big so it gets not crouded. The movie on the big ""Samsung TV"" is great and gives a good overview!"
"We arrived here on our own after hiring a car & driver from Hoi an, which gave us a few hours to explore this vast place. the sheer size alone makes it almost impossible to walk around on foot, which is where those annoying cycloped guys come in handy for once. They will hound you mercilessly for an hours ride around the Imperial city, and it is a good way to see the vast grounds and tombs etc, especially in that humid heat. On returning we were dropped off at the wrong gate as i wanted to see the large compound containing many abandoned American hardware like helicopters, tanks etc, which meant a long walk to the main gate, the admission price here to see this iconic place is laughable compared to what we pay back home for something similar, unfortunately there is a lot of restoration work taking place all over including the large entrance it's self which means the dreaded scaffolding everywhere, not good for photos.
on entering you are met with some very old buildings which seems to have been neglected over the years and it's only now that the government has seen the potential in tourist money and are hastily trying to revive the citadel to it's former glory, hence the smell of fresh paint everywhere and scaffolding. The main area of interest is the grand hall where there is the Emperors chair with surrounding opulence to match, unfortunately there is a total ban on photos here which is enforced by the ever watching security guards, and as you pass through there are some exhibits including a detailed miniature model of the entire complex which is quite handy.
There is one other hall which has another royal chair where for a small fee you can dress up as an Emperor and get your picture taken, seeing this makes you wonder just what some tourists get out of this ? As for me i thought it was just too tacky for words almost ""Disney like""
not what i expected at all, but on display are some very old clothes belonging to some long dead Emperor or so. Outside walking around the grounds was pretty disappointing too, almost derelict with crumbling steps, statues and overgrown grass, as this area was once a battle ground back in '68 during the Tet offensive it's no wonder the place looks kinda war weary as a large group of Vietcong held out here for two months against all the odds, before the inevitable conclusion by the Americans. But perhaps in a few years time this old place will be fully restored to it's former glory, but as it is work in progress for now. On leaving here you will see opposite the very large flag tower with an even larger Vietnam flag flying on it, we left through the main wall gate entrance and be careful as this is a main road with no pavement and the cars & bikes take no prisoners here. Yes this place is definitely worth a good look just for the history attached alone, it might also be prudent to go with a guided tour or bring a good book to bring this place alive before it gets too touristy, and yes there is is the obligatory souvenir shop which is quite reasonably priced for now....!"
"I accepted the entreaties of a bicycle rickshaw driver to tour the Imperial City as well as the Citadel (within the City), and was not disappointed. We stopped at various little sites, including Ho Chi Minh's birthplace which I found most interesting as well as the old palace which now houses the museum. The citadel itself was a bit less interesting."
"The citadel is quite run down and mostly destroyed, so not much to see here. It is nice to walk around if you have the time, but if you are short on time the Minh Mang and Khai Dinh tombs are a much better choice.
Also, don't stay inside until the last minutes as they can close the gates earlier then they suppose too. We found a guard at the throne room to open the gates for us :)"
You have to go here if you are in Hue! Its fascinating to know that in the Vietnam war it had the devil bombed out of it because thats where the political capital was at the time. A tour guide is a must though.
"It was raining the day that we went to the Citadel but with the aid of a couple of umbrellas, this didn't really make a difference. The citadel is beautiful and I think it would be a great place for people of any age to go and visit. The grounds are immaculately kept, as are the imperial artefacts. Feeding the fish was great fun!"
"As a bit of a history buff, I was looking forward to visiting the Citadel. I had a guide who was knowledgeable, the weather was fine if steamy and I was aware the there was long term restoration going on. The approach to the main entrance was impressive and the Flag Tower stood in solitary splendour. The size of the site meant that it never felt like a tourist squeeze. The urns were just beautiful as were many of the other elements of the Citadel but the gem was the Thai Hoa Palace. The design of the building is elegant and everything hums with meaning. Hours could be spent looking at it and enjoying the sense of the momentous events that occurred here but unfortunately that wasn't possible. The Citadel deserves more than an hour or two so if possible plan a couple of visits - it's not that expensive."
"This is truly a very impressive sight. Lots of history packed in this citadel. Massive walls around it, in it you will get a very good impression how it must have been to live there. Don't forget to hae you picture taken in traditional clothes."
"Very scenic, and a cultural experience! Go to the top of the fifth entrance and view the inner city and exterior of the city from one spot. Stop by the war planes exhibit and definitely go inside the Citadel."
"The old imperial city of Vietnam still remains one of the most interesting sights in Hue. The Purple Forbidden city is unfortunately still under major repair after the wars, but wtill worth a visit. Do not miss an evening inside the rest of the citadel, not only the forbidden city."
"actually. I was almost out of time there,so I went on a cycle tour. The bicycle with the front seat.was great. I had to read up on the history of it later."
The Citadel is an expansive area. Go early and enjoy the walk. Also walk to the east of the citadel and enjoy lunch at Le Jardin du Garambole.
"The Imperial City is a fantastic place to visit. It's was really interesting to learn about Vietnamese history and get an understanding of what it would be like back in time. I'd recommend bringing a guide if you aren't part of a tour group. I doubt our experience would be the same if we didn't have someone explaining a lot of the details to us. Take time to walk around and explore the grounds, there's so much to see and a lot of really cool places off the main axis of the Citadel."
"Really enjoyed the few hours I spent wandering around the Citadel, the buildings were well worth seeing and it was so quiet and peaceful in there, it added to the experience and the atmosphere"
"It was so hot as we clambered about, up and down stairs, very tiring and we wondered when our guide would cease his relentless pursuit of our knowledge of Vietnamese history. The grounds are very expansive but all so interesting, but can be very tiring to see everything. We enjoyed visiting the Citadel once we sat down and had a cool drink. The Vietnamese are very proud of their history."
Absolutely amazing. Be prepared to spend along time and do alot of walking. Best with a guide as signs and details aren't displayed in English.
"Don't understand someone disappointed to the imperial city, it was great to see the site with our guide (from Tin Tin - our tour guide from Your Truly Local Operation in Hoi An). He was so informative and made us really enjoyed the trip. We totally be happy with our hotel's recomendation to come to Hue with Tin Tin. Thanks Tin Tin"
"It started so promisingly, great landscaped garden with impressive ancient buildings to step into and experience. But it's hard to learn what they all meant, why they were all here. Walking round with a lonely planet helped but with a lack of guide, signs or any other help it soon becomes a colection of building and ruins in no context. Shame"
"First up, as other reviewers have pointed out, the place is huge so come prepared with a hat, umbrella and good walking shoes. Many of the buildings here have been restored almost were destroyed by bombing raids during the Vietnam War or by typhoon. Some of the restored buildings have that 'Disneyland' quality in that everything is shiny and new. But towards the rear of the Imperial city are some quiet pockets that have yet to be restored - here the mood is more authentic, if not a little gritty. Overall one visit should suffice."
"The Imperial citadel located in near the hue city and just like a park. People play there, take photo there, walk there, life seems slow and quiet with the ancient atmosphere!

I like the citadel and the small road along the river around the huge citadel."
"This place is really huge. Our hotel booked us a ride on the perfume river on a dragon boat to the pagoda then they took us back to the Citadel. We evidently missed the overcast weather that Hue is famous for. When we were there it was incredibly hot and not a cloud in the sky. The boat ride was really hot (no breeze - had a tail wind) and you sat in plastic chairs (at least not the mini-kind so prevalent around Vietnam!). The boat that was hired for us was a family with a new baby in a hammock on the boat. Of course, once on the boat we were a captive audience and of course, the mother had some trinkets to sell to support her family. We did end up buying a small picture that we liked and felt like it would genuinely help the family. I wondered what it would be like growing up on a dragon boat! Anyway, we tried to do the citadel later in the afternoon thinking it would be a quick little jaunt. It is really large and the map on the back of your ticket provides minimal assistance. Many things have basic information in English, but I feel like we didn't truly appreciate the place because we were hot, tired, and didn't have enough info about the sites to do it justice. At some point they have elephant rides where you get even don a fancy costume. There are a few shops with water for a decent, but touristy price and there were free restrooms at regular intervals."
"It's worth a visit, and you really should take a few hours time to discover it. Sadly many buildings are in a very bad condition! A problem is, that all the buildings are signed out very bad, and the descriptions can't be read any more...so make sure you have your guidebook with you!"
"nice to walk around and see quickly in an hour at leisure 2 hours

hue is worth stopping for a few days"
"After staying in Saigon for 5 days we travel to Hue and the first place we were introuduced by our tour guide is Hue Imperial City. She told us that the Imperial City was recognized as a World Cultural Heritage Site by UNESCO on December 1993. And It still remaining its form of City underMiddle Age and the constructions of monarchic. Going around the Imperial City, we found that this place was very ancient and we took many pictures. After that we went on the River trip and visited the tombs of the emperors. Again worthwile."
"this is a very large and open site, bring pleanty of water and sunblock, there is alot of resotoration going on at the moment as most of the site was destroyed by the french and the american war"
"It may take many years but this Imperial City is getting rebuilt through UNESCO funding.
To see the model of how it once was, laid out in front of you, shows how impressive it used to be.
It is well worth a visit but take a guide with you to explain everything. It wouldn't have been the same without one."
"If you've sen the royal tombs, visitng the Imperial city would probably be more of the same to you.
OK, so it's bigger than the royal tombs (combined), but there's no uniqueness here - not a t all.
You can finish your visit here in 2-3 hours if you are into details.
Otherwise, less than an hour will do the trick.
Make sure to check owt the huge cannons outside the site."
"Was great in historical, politico-cultural significance but wish there could've been more restoration works done about it. But overall was an interesting visit"
We had a guide which made it worthwhile as you got a great insight into each building and the history behind the Citadel. We had kids in tow so a shorter trip than what I would have liked but you could easily spend a day here. Devoid of most traffic it is simply a beautiful spot to visit.
"It will probably take you two hours to explore the sites and it's really worth it. Make sure that you take the main entrance as it is the ONLY one. We tried to take another one that the various maps make u think that they exit but they don't. And surrounding the full place is 2.4 km and quite tiring in the heat, supported by the offers of lots of cyclo business men, including all their tricks.
I will not explain all the details of the inside. 2 thinks are impressive. The existing buildings (only a few because most of it has been destroyed in the war) and the way they are restoring it step by step in a very nice and lovely detailed manner. You can explore also the places which are under construction. For people who are a bit interested in craftsmanship, this is a fantastic opportunity to explore the traditional building techniques.
So, if you are in Hue, this is clearly a place to go and to feel the prosperity of vietnamese history."
Take a pedicab! It's the best and only way. It was HOT when we toured that day and the pedicab saved us from passing out. Plus the driver was a proud man who gave us a great history lesson. Well worth the price!
"Didnt bother doing a tour or using a guide. Just wandered around for half a day.
Beware the touts trying to sell their services. Many have very limited English and an overinflated beleif of their worth. Overcharging is rampant."
This is a must see in Hue. Other than that we didn't appreciate the city that much so don't plan too many days in this city
This place was unbelievable it is absolutely huge. We walked it and it took all day but it's so big that you almost feel like your there on your own as nowhere got crowded well the ice cream shop had a small queue :-)
"When we visited the citadel the place was being renovated (I have no idea for how long). It is definitely a must see in Hue if you ask me. It is thought-provoking that the citadel is from the time of the dynasts and to imagine how magnificient it must have looked.
The place is very big and to see everything one must spend a fair amount of time walking aroung. Still this is not necesary. The people renovating the place has put all their attention to the front buildings and therefore most of the stuff in the back of the big compound is not worth seeing"
"Being restored, but looking around the ruins were very interesting. Still damage from the war evident on some of the walls with bullet holes etc."
"The visit takes half a day. The citadel is very big, contains a theatre, a college, a lot of pagoda. It looks like a system to defende yourself and live far from dangers. Very nice place"
This place was beautiful and large enough that you could escape the crowd and wander around at your own pace. Good video explanation of the history of the site before you began to walk around making this one of Vietnams most navigable tourist sites I feel.
"With ongoing restoration still happening, and evenbwith the forbidden purple city decimated, The Citidel is the real reason you visit Hue. To stand on the balcony whet the last of Nguyen Emporeors stood and to look out is an amazing feeling. Allow your self whole day to visit, there is a lot to take in. One of most vivid memories of flying out of Hue at dusk was looking down at the Old Imperial City, which was in darkness, as opposed to the rest of Hue. It made me realize how big it really was and what a loss it's physical destruction must be to the people of Vietnam. If you only visit Hue for a day this is a must do!"
"This is definitely worth a visit, you can spend many an hour wandering around the citadel.
Many buildings have Been lost due to War, many are in disrepair. But renovation work has begun. And the buildings that are there are beautiful, you can get guides to take you around.
We actually hired cyclos to take us around, just remember to negotiate your price first, so you don't get ripped off. Our cyclo driver was great he was also like a tour guide, his knowledge of the area was good. And his English was good. This is truly a historical site."
You have to see this place. Amazing. We did a tour with our Hotel and they took us around. The history here is unreal and to get to walk round a site like this is brilliant.
"The citadel is quite large and if you're in Hue worth a visit. It is more run-down that a lot of sites we've seen in SEA but that for us that was a benefit.
That said - not one of our top highlights."
"The Imperial City must have been huge and beautiful but lots of the buildings were destroyed during the war. The renovation works are started and they really try to make it like it was before.
This Is certainly a visit you can't miss. I enjoyed to visit it with our guide to understand the way the emperor lived here."
"Although not as grand as China's, this is to prove that Vietnam had their own royalty sometime ago. The site was way from the noise of the city, providing a tranquil few hours to leisurely explore all of the palace rooms, pavillions etc. You might feel the royal atmosphere that lies in the old building. Recommend visiting this site at early morning or late afternoon to avoid crowds and tourists."
"Old ruins are not really my thing but my partner really enjoyed it. There's no information inside so I lost interest after the 1st old wall! There's 2 ticket tables, we were turned away from the 1st and paid 80,000 at the 2nd. On the way out we walked past the 1st table and saw the Vietnamese tickets cost 55,000. Another example if tourists getting ripped off but at the end of the day it cost less than 3 quid."
"Great history and a easy walk around. A lot of buildings were destroyed but there is restoration work going on to get it back to its former glory.
Lots of info on site as well as a video presentation explaining the site which has pretty good graphics.
Could spend some time here so take some water and sunscreen. Not the worlds most fascinating site but certainly one not to miss."
"The admission tickets vary. There is a marked price if you are Vietnamese, and the price is higher for a foreigner. I don't think that would be fair at all. It was extremely hot inside, as there weren't many trees around to keep us cool. Don't visit around 11am-3pm, as the sun can get you drenched in your sweat. Bring big bottle of water and a fan if you must. This attraction is not all that great, not much is left of it. The emperor who had this city built for himself, to make a city within a city in this way was (in my opinion) ridiculous. It was completely ruined. He should have focused on building a stronger country, better transportation systems for his people. Perhaps this is why he failed. Now there stands a huge, flying Communist Party Flag at its front gate."
"The Imperial city is undeniably an unique historical site in Vietnam. Most of the buildings were destroyed during Tet 1968. It's a glimpse of Nguyen's Dynasty and how Vietnam history had tried to be independent from foreign influences. Unfortunately, the Citadel was also a pitiless reminder of war. Like other reviewers suggested, visitors should hire a local tour guide, who was born and raised in Hue, to learn many interesting stories about the place."
"It was raining when I visit this place , rather cold so I decided to stay indoor and there's a Tv in the main hall for tourist to see the history of this place . Didn't wander around much due to the rain , it's like a small replica of the forbidden city in China ."
Nice place to visit. The video was interesting. It's a pity that most of the original citadel was destroyed during the war.
The Imperial city is undeniably a must-visit place BUT you really should hire a tour guide or go on a tour to learn many intriguing stories about the place. And remember to bring your suncream and a big bottle of water.
"We had a personal tour guide, Truong from Trails of Indochina, and he was fantastic. So much history and loved his description of what they did to the Eunuchs"
"Not much to say,,would have been better I guess if the Viet Cong North Vietnam soldiers did not attack it durring Tet 1968 and murder 3000 civil service people and then expect South Vietnam and US army not to fight back inside the beautiful Citadel, because most is just reproduction buildings."
"The Citadel in Hue though cannot compare to the Beijing's it has different taste. I was impressed by the outer appearance of the large and thick wall with the huge flag pole that is already visible from a distance .. Through the main gate I reached the first main courtyard after a great palace follows. In the complex there are numerous palaces and temples for which you may want to see, depending on your interest and time. I spent two hours there. That was amazing and enjoyable. At that time there were some renovations but it was still good enough to walk around and know about the citadel and its history."
"Liked: The ancient Oriental history and architecture: the moat, temples, incense urns, statues, etc. And the largest flag I've ever seen!

Disliked: The lack of shade and the indifferent crowds"
"Citadel is the first place we went because it is the nearest attraction to our hotel.
There was light drizzle during the whole visit, we dont really enjoy the walk. Apart from the main entrance and the first 2 building, the rest of the palace is a ruined. can see a lot of maintenance and upgrading work in progress but really there isnt much to be seen.
The surrounding at the main entrance was quite cooling because off all the big trees around, it would be a nicer place to walk on the non rainny day."
"This site was way from the noise of the city, providing a tranquil few hours to leisurely explore all of the palace rooms, tombs etcThe way in could be signposted a little better, and the bicycle pushers are a a bit of a nuisance on route. It is a good walk to get there, if you don't fance the ride in the front seat of the bicyle contraptions. Once inside, however, it is a great piece of history to explore."
"Still a work in progress after the French and US attacks. A wonderful walk between ruins and refurbished buildings, witnessing the craziness of our world"
"It was really nice.
All the places are worth a visit.
Take water with you because inside they charge so much. And is terribly hot under the sun!!
There is a really nice video in the main hall, watch it, is really interesting."
Just walking in the historic structure seems to give many visitors a new respect for the sacrifices here over time.
"worth seeing, it was a very hot day so we did not spend too long there, got some cool photos though. its a must see for Hue"
"The site is ahving great renovation. So the photo opportunity is limited. almost half of the site is in ruin. Maybe another 2 years will be all restored.
The royal atmospher that lies in the old building. Altough not as grand as Emperor of China, this is the prove that Vietnam had their own royalty sometime ago.
Visit this site, early morning to avoid tourist group. or late afternoon."
Not worth the money. We went there expecting more information and a beautiful place to visit but a lot of it was under construction and in ruins.
This was an amazing place and easy to see what it would have been like in its heyday. Sad to see large buildings had been completely destroyed in the Vietnam War. There was a small museum showing photos which brought to life what the city would have been like. Sad to see two elephants in the grounds who were clearlyt distressed
"Had a great day in the imperial city, amazing sights, stunning history and fascinating restoration. We had an insightful day and came away with a greater understanding of Vietnams early history. Loads to do and see for children too, highly recommend."
"There is more still standing than we were expecting, and the retoration is being carried out extremely well. What a shame the warmongering idiots allowed such a fantastic site to be so badly damaged."
"Some sections that were destroyed by bombs during the war were left as it is. You feel the pain and suffering of war. Other than that some sections are better maintained than the others.

Strong Chinese influence in the construction. Even the poems engraved in the buildings are in Chinese language.

It is a must see when you're in Hue. Admission 80,000VND.

I would have spent my whole day there if not for the 38deg cel in end July 2012."
"If you're in Vietnam you're going to see a few citadels. This is not one of the better ones. The outside is amazing, however inside is overgrown and run down. I am happy I saw it, but don't need to see it again and I wouldn't add it to a ""must see"" list."
"The Hue Citadel in now being restored slowly mainly due to international aid contributions. Those few parts that escaped the Tet offensive are still quite superb. I wouldn't usually wish this but a bit more commercialism may be of assistance, eg maps, identification of sites of destroyed buildings, coffee table books of old photos etc would have been appreciated."
"A very interesting place from a historical perspective. Imperial courts have been there, modern wars have been fought within its ancient walls. The old city around it is very charming as well, lots of small restaurants to discover and places to walk or catch a drink."
"Perhaps I expected something like a miniature version of Beijing's 'Forbidden City' out of the Imperial City in Hue and so set myself up for dissapointment from the start. I think it is fair to say that we were quite underwhelmed by the whole thing: we understood before going that it had been bombed and so it was damaged, however there were hardly any remains left and the ones that were were not well maintained. There was quite a lot of rubbish and debris lying around from lazy workmanship and the gardens and pathways were quite overgrown. Even the best of imaginations struggles to envisage what it was like in its hayday. Interesting enough to see but not really worth the entrance fee - better off going on a trip round the tombs which are better preserved."
"worth spending 2 or 3 hours wandering the many buildings in this complex.Its easy bto imagine life in former times, and you can dress the part for a photo for $3 if you fancy."
Much of the Imperial City was destroyed by US bombs. It has not been rebuilt. I'd spend less time there and more at the Royal Tombs on the other side of the river.
"This place is much bigger than you expect. Hue was heavily bombed during the war by the Americans and what a shame, it would have been amazing in it's day. Still very interesting and they are renovating what they can. It will be a long process and many buildings will never be rebuilt. A guide will make the difference here, otherwise it will seem like lots of ruins and a few restored buildings. You will miss a lot without one."
"Costs 80000VND to visit. It's like a smaller(but still large!) and less grand Beijing's Forbidden City . Most of it still require better restoration efforts. I encountered a signboard that describes a temple beyond an entrance but when you enter, you realise there is no temple building there, just a grass patch with local's motorbikes parked there - must have been destroyed. Do catch the video on the LCD TV in the first building after the entrance - it gives an overview of the site. Visiting under the scorching heat of the day, I got bored after a while and exited the site after an hour."
"Impressive, but a long way to go for the restoring all. A pity that people trow their gabbage all over."
"At 80,000 vnd entrance I was a little bit taken aback (especially as the price for Vietnamese was 55,000 vnd) but hadn't realised that all the main historical sites are housed within the city walls.

There didn't seem to be any detailed maps available or even on sale and we were thankful we had downloaded a few free apps which contained not only a decent map but information about the various sites, temples and ruins contained within the imperial city walls and the forbidden purple city within. (City Walks and then download Hue guide)

In the building directly behind the entrance (The Palace of Supreme Harmony) there are two LCD tvs in the back portion of the palace. These show the construction of the arena and reasons for the emperors conducting fights between elephants and tigers on one screen and on the second, a digitised reconstruction of the whole citadel as it used to be. This was a great short film to watch as gave you an overview not only of how big the site was but where the buildings actually stood and their purpose.

Some parts of the site are well cared for, with the best maintained buildings found in the front left quater of the site; however I would recommend a anti-clockwise loop through mostly ruins, ending your tour in the well maintained section which houses the 9 Dynastic Urns.

It's true that there is a lot of work to be done to restore the entire site, but it is really worth a few hours of your time now and a little bit of imagination to bring an old civilisation back to life."
"Having liked Hue as a city, and had a cyclo tour around the citadel (which we bargained hard for a good price and thoroughly enjoyed), my husband and I decided we would go to the Imperial City as recommended by our guide book. From outside it is surrounded by large walls and pretty archways on bridges to enter, it looked very grand! There is a big fortress outside with a big Vietnamese flag, which made for a great photo. As we queued to get it, we were told by the ticket lady to move to the other queue (tourist queue) and paid a higher price (80,000D) which is pretty normal practice in Vietnam, however a very steep price for what is inside! The first bit is a very big room with a throne, very grand and pretty, not a lot of information on display but several signs banning photographs. We then went back out to a huge courtyard with a nice statue and headed out to tour the Imperial City. There was a large grassy area where you can pay for an elephant ride and get ripped off for snacks and drinks, then several building ruins with no real signposts and information about what you were seeing. Some of the buildings are locked up/lived in and we weren't sure if we had accidently wandered into staff quarters or if we were allowed to be in there. Some of it makes for a pretty walk, but to be honest, having already been around the citadel, it was no better. Save some money and don't bother with the Imperial City, just get a cyclo tour or rent a bike and have a look around the Citadel."
The city was so big that we only saw a part of it. It was well worth the trip from our hotel. It's pretty amazing.
"It is beautiful to see how they are restoring this place, there is still a lot of restoration to be done which will take some time to finish.

It is a must see place."
"When visiting Hue you have to see the Citadel. A great historical site where you get a glimpse of how life must have been during imperial times. A lot of renovation is taking place because a lot of the buildings have decayed, but still it is an impressive place to visit."
The only interesting thing to see in Hue really but ruined for us by being scammed for a tour which turned out to cost twice as much as they quoted.
"Very impressive. Had the chance to visit when there were very few people; almost had the site ourselves at some point. Lovely gardens, even for a stroll, enchanting place!"
"As we didn't really looked into the history of the Citadel, we found it nice to visit it. Entrance for tourists was VND 80.000 for a day. On a hot day, make sure to bring some water with you (water inside is bit more expensive).

Nice old buildings, but probably more worth to book a tourguide within the Citadel, giving more information about the history."
"We cycled there on our own. Before entering, we did another loop ride to have a feel of the size. They are indeed huge for visiting by foot at 38C. Get ready, water, cap, sunblock, cameras and of course a curious and open mind. Fee for foreigner is VND80,000, which is still pretty reasonable.

The citadel is really an eye opening palace with double layer of moths for protection. All the gates are well protected. Too bad some of the structures were damaged during war. I really hope they will refurbish them to look old and authentic rather than modern and glittering.

in short, a must visit place."
A must see when in Hue. Have to use some imagination but restoration under way which looks very authentic. The site is huge we just kept finding different bits. Take water and a hat and of course a camera
"Give yourself plenty of time to wander around the amazing grounds and through so many stylish buildings. Take water and have your camera ready we spent most of morning so pleased we went, go see for yourself, too many things to describe ."
"Once you get out of the first two buildings the tour busses seem to dissipate. Really lovely grounds but very little information makes it nothing more than a park really.

Do take water the stalls charge... Wait for it... 30,000 for a bottle. The stalls outside can be negotiated down to a more acceptable 10,000. Also no loos inside which means you end up peeing behind trees (not nice).

Overall it could be an expensive trip. Admission is 80,000 for white skinned people, I think it's 55,000 for Asians. Always disappointing to see racism at heratage sites but unfortunatly fairly common."
We tend to keep away from most tourist sites. This one was worth the effort and gave interest in the past history as we wanted.
"The citadel is Vietnam's equivalent to Beijing's Forbidden city. Although the main gate area and the palace are in good condition, the pavillions located at the rear end seemed dilapidated. I think the government is currently on its way in restoring these."
"It was amazing to be able to wonder around the Imperial City and imagine how life must have been.
I am disappointed I did not hire a guide, I am sure it would have made it even more special. At the time I was there, I only saw French speaking guides, and they would be no help to me."
"I loved the facility, we hope they continue restoring it. Suggest you hire a good guide, for the stories and history behind the area make this a place to vist on everyone's list"
It took us a little time to find the Citadel but once there it was a place of wonder to explore and learn all the history. Make sure you have a few hours to spare because there is so much to see. be careful when asking directions from the cyclo drivers as they tell you the wrong way if you don't use their service (he smelled of many beers) and then follow you to try to deliver you to the correct address. Luckliy some other tourists who were not so lucky set us straight.
we booked an English speaking guide who was excellent. Her knowledge of history meant that we got the most out of our visit. She answered all of our many questions and provided insights into the country's history that gave us much food for thought.
"Super spectacular and amazing. We walked around all day and there are just so many things to see. The temples, gardens and the history is really exciting. very recommendable"
"we went here with a guide on a tour- which I would recommend, because the history of the place is fascinating."
"This citadel has such a story to tell. You can picture the Emperor living there with his concubines and wives. Then along came the wars and so much of it was damaged. They are doing a lot of work renovating it and what they have done is ornate and rich.
A very fascinating place to see."
Huge place - takes a while to walk around site. A lot of the buildings are under restoration but interesting to see all the workers sanding and gilding the old woodwork. A guide will be helpful as there is a lot to see and the history is really interesting. Very hot when we were there so avoid the middle of the day if you want to time you time and look around.
"Entrance fee for foreigners was 80,000 dongs (USD $4). It was very hot and humid in July, so be prepared."
"I found this complex quite interesting and the parts of it that still stand including the main entrance gates and the reception palace and theatre are great. They give a great insight into another time. It is just a shame that when one gets to the actual centre, the private forbidden city of the emperor, it is just a field.

One can still spend a few hours wandering around and dressing up as an emperor and getting photos taken in the throne was great fun for the (teenage) kids.

They are restoring some other buildings and it will look fantastic once finished. Overall, I was glad that we visited it."
"Is a great place, but big portion are still under restoration. Can go by yourself and spend longer time if you are not follow group tour."
"Perfect for a few hours tour in ancient atmosphere of former Vietnam Capital; try to avoid hot hour, best time around 5 pm to enjoy the old town with amazing colors from sunset"
Taken with a guide - Mandarin Road - it was interesting and enjoyable.
"It is enormous. Theres oppportuities to dress as an emporer and be photographed on the throne, by an elephand or in a carried chair. I would have liked a brochure explaining the various aspects."
"Leaves a remarkable impression about the royal past of Vietnam, before the French and Vietcong. Maybe it requires some more quality restoration and a proper map; but still is a must visit of Vietnam.
One should keep some time in hand to enjoy this imperial galore at leisure and soak in the history."
We all loved The Citadel. I was full of such amazing to look at we took several hours to make our way around. Definitely worth visiting while in Hue. xo
"This was the first ""war"" site I visited on my visit to Vietnam and was an excellent introduction to the overall flow of the war, especially the Tet Offensive. Too bad so many original buildings were levelled but what remains is the best of the lot. Reconstruction and restoration is slow but quite competent."
"Very impressive place. Idiosyncratically speaking, it give an idea of the king of power emperor had and to measure how much communism is better than that. Going from an extreme to another, still another few years before the balance stop in the middle."
Very hot! But we liked the fact that it was in the process of being restored and not just pristine. Watch out for touts trying to sell you expensive cyclo rides and getting a bit aggressive!
They are really making an effort to restore the buildings destroyed by the bombing and even now the buildings (both original and restored) were very impressive.
We did not have a guide and it was a mistake. To ensure that you receive the most out of the Citadel organise a guide.
"Great site for taking pictures, bring water, it's hot in there."
"We stayed in Hue with our family in 2007 and, of course, visited the Imperial City. On that occasion, we had our own private guide to take us through and give us an overview of the history of Vietnam, the Imperial City and its Imperial families. Some areas were out-of-bounds. On our 2021 visit, we went without a guide as we had already done a tour but we had also bought books about the Imperial City and the Imperial families and were 'armed' with information. We were able to wander through all areas right through to the back of the grounds which we weren't able to do last time. It was great to see workmen in action and also terrific to see the progress of all the restorations. It's happening slowly and we're sure with our next visit to Hue, we will notice changes again. Unusual to see a fantastic tennis court at the back of the grounds. King Bao Dai had a tennis court installed during his reign and it is now a 'rubberised' turf for people to hire/use. Asking a local about her thoughts, she said she didn't like the refurbished tennis court or the fact that anyone can now hire it. She thinks other areas should have been worked on first and that, even though the tennis court was originally built in the grounds, the Imperial City is now a national treasure and should not have people of today playing there. We tend to agree.
The South Koreans/Samsung have quite a lovely recreation dvd that plays in the back of the The Mieu Temple [behind the Emperors Throne]. This was also a welcome addition to visit. We know there is a lack of tourist information at the Citadel but that is Vietnam. It's tourist industry is growing and developing and we suppose that is what we love about Vietnam; its still quite untouched. As with any overseas trip, we spend time learning about the country and its people and history before we leave."
The citadel is vast and is very interesting. However it lacks tourist information (unless you join a scheduled tour) and there is a lot of construction work going on. Plan for a short visit!
"This should be top of everyone's Hue to do list. There are many types of buildings in the complex in various states. We went on a weekday an it was fairly deserted. Gets a good breeze too, so find a shady spots relax for a while."
"Historians of Southeast Asia often note that the Vietnamese differ from other Southeast Asian peoples in that their culture has been more influenced by China (Sinocized) rather than India (Indianized). The further north you go in Vietnam, the more obvious this becomes. One of the best examples of the influence of China in Vietnam is Hue Imperial City, where the emperors of Vietnam created their own Forbidden City, based on the world-famous prototype in Beijing. With its massive walls and enormous moats, it was clearly meant to strike awe into the emperor's subjects. Despite the fact that many of the buildings were destroyed in the War, what remains will give you an impression of what imperial grandeur looked like in pre-colonial Vietnam. This is certainly one of the most important historical complexes in the nation."
Probably could have got more out of the Citadel tour with a guide. We walked a portion of the grounds on our own. My kids got too hot see we didn't see much. Most of the poster boards had a sufficient amount of English.
"To me, unless you're a hardcore temple lover this place isn't anything special. It's nice and everything but really doesn't take much time to see unless you explore in detail every nook and cranny."
The Citadel is huge and can be tiring in the hot weather. However it is also fascinating and well worth making the effort to see. Make sure you have water with you.
This place is very big and a hot day in June like we were there it can be very hard to do it justice. There is lots to see but we only stayed a short time ( about 1/2 an hour )as it was so hot but we did enjoy seeing what we did.
Really interesting site to visit. Explore at a leisurely pace and see it all - especially the destroyed part where the US decided to bomb to get the sneaky VC hiding inside!
"This site is huge and requires a few hours to do properly. I would also recommend a guide in order to understand the various buildings in the complex. It is also worthwhile to climb to the top of the outer wall to get a better impression of the size of the complex. I liked the architecture and the displays.
The only downside is the hawkers/taxis on the outside which can get a bit much."
"we spent hours wandering through the citadel.Great insight into palace life,well worth visiting."
"The place was partially destroyed during WW2 , and there is'nt that much to se. If you have limited time better go to Tomb of Khai Dinh which was much more interesting"
Still being restored. But loved the imperial palace and the photo opportunities are incredible.
"Well, in its day it must have been absolutely spectacular, and now all that's left are ruins for the most part. The South Koreans have provided a video that shows what it should look like when it's been rebuilt (they ought to know about rebuilding historic buildings). It was big, it's still impressive and it's just too bad about the war."
The Citadel and the surrounding walls and moat is very impressive. Fun to explore where the old Kings use to rule from. Especially enjoyed the old coffee shop at the back of the Citidel on top of the wall. Fun to set up there where the King used to go to catch a breeze and watch the world go by.
"The history of the Citadel is very interesting itself, and it is great that people can go visit this former royal residence. However, it needs an update. The trilingual marble signs explaining about the Citadel were very difficult to read, some of them were impossible to read, because they were too old. Also, as we walked through the grounds, there were old bags of construction material and other trash laying around, which destroyed the atmosphere of the place. There were also two elephants, which did not seem to have much care.
Apart from that, the Citadel is worth going to, as it is in fact the main attraction of Hue."
The Citadel and the adjacent Fortbidden Purple City are quite a surprise. A pity that there was so much damaged during the war but these are two mlocations which originally were on a grand scale. THey provide a lot of insight into Vietnam's rich history and culture.
Even though we visited in the rain it could not dampen our enthusiasm. This is the reason we visited Hue. The sprawling Citadell is still intact enough ( or restored) to give you an idea of how it must have been in its glory days. There is also a free video presentation that takes you through the entire complex with graphics showing how it was/is now and what they are doining about it. It really is a must see.
"Thought the attraction was ok and was enjoying seeing the remains of the palace. As we walked further into the grounds we saw two elephants and horses, we headed over for a closer look but then came to realise to our horror that the elephants were chained by their leg to post. They had barely 10ft of chain to walk around and we even saw one stretching itself trying to reach its food. It was extremely upsetting to see such animal cruelty. After this we decided to leave as it completly ruined the whole attraction. Elephants or any animal should not be chained up, treated and exploited like this. We felt disgusted that we had funded such an attraction that allows this on its premises. Will never be going again! and would not of gone in the first place if we had known! If you agree with this review then please do not help fund this attraction. It is basically just a ruined building, overgrown with grass and builders working over the roofs. That is an honest opinion of the palace itself and not reflection of what we saw with the elephants."
You could cast your mind back while looking at the photos and film etc. to see the spender it once was. Amazing didn't have enough time there though vast place.
"As you enter this space you transcend nto a different era. Vast spaces, castles, family quarters and beautiful greenery gives you a good idea of a dynasty that once was.

A lot of photo opportunities as you can see the old, the new and restored buildings. The kids also enjoyed the historical re-enactment videos of the royal family.

There's elephant rides, restrooms, souvineur shops and snacks shop. You could also use a gholf cart @ a fee to tour the whole area. Lovely atmosphere , but extremely big so good walking shoes, hat, sunglasses and big bottle of water should carry you through."
Huge area but some area still in the progress of restoration. The main building is well restored and they very pickle about photo taking. The elephant ride was the highlight for my kids!
"This place, known as the Purple Forbidden City has far more charm BECAUSE it is still in ruins. We strolled around this (delightfully uncrowded) evocative old palace as restorers sat atop scaffolding brushing on new layers of gold and crimson. We almost hoped they would stop and let the plants continue growing from the tiles, let toads live in the broken staircases and buildings bare the tale of American bombings. But yes, well worth preserving for generations to come to see. Loved the hall with emperors robes and found Vietnamese museums impressive in their explanations of the culture. Not ever fair to compare but we enjoyed this far more than the Beijing Forbidden City, which was crowded and fully restored, so missed some of teh atmosphere."
We walked here after a bad experience with a cyclo the day before. However we were pleased that we did because we got to spend a fare bit of time here appreciating the impressiveness of this area. It must have been awesome when the Royal family were living here 1802 - 1945.
Time has stood still here. half expected to see the Emperor and concubines wandering around
"Although still being renovated after the war, the city is most impressive and extensive. Don't forget to your the citadel around the imperial city as well. Lots of interesting things to see."
this place is in ruin. I think it'd be nice to visit if the place wasn't so hot and filled with insect and in ruins. u go there to watch a tape of what the place would have looked like.
"It was 38 Celsius on the day we visited the Citadel. Despite the high temperature, we enjoyed the visit to the vast complex with gardens, beautiful buildings and (sadly) remnants what were undoubtedly also interesting sites. (See my pictures) The visit to the Citadel is one of the highlights of Hué, however, the visit will be enhanced, if you have engaged a good tour guide. Beware of the stalls, where they sell coffee, tea and lemonade. They charge the earth. (Relatively of course, but 3 times the downtown Hue price is normal). For refreshment you better can visit the coffee house at the far side of the Citadel. Indifferent service but reasonable prices."
loved the fact of walking through it and being there and imagining the history that went into a place like that...normally you see this stuff in asian movies...was good to see it
It was definitely worth the admission price to see the Imperial City. We did a self-tour but I would recommend having a guide give you a tour as much information about the city we didn't get except from our tour book.
Nice to see that some destroyed places are being rebuilt. Still some interesting area that were kept though.
"Impressive place. Bit surprised the lawns, gardens weren't a bit tidier."
"We really enjoyed the Imperial city! It is 80,000d to get in ($4.00) and it is well worth it!

We found the left side (as you enter) was very interesting with beautiful gardens and separate buildings and court yards. There is also an elephant there you can have a ride on.

It is very hot so wear a hat and sunscreen and drink plenty of water!

We spend a half day there but you could spend a day sitting in the gardens a relaxing.

It was very quiet when we were there in low season, best time to travel!!!"
"This very large area in Hue is where the Imperial family lived and ruled. There are many buildings, some more interesting than others. Some parts have been destroyed, especially during the war in the 1960s and some buildings are being renovated. To see the whole Imperial City would take a day--we saw some of the more interesting, beautiful sections and we were there for more than 1/2 day. You should visit it you are in Hue--it is an important part of Vietnamese history."
Really enjoyed going here. Learnt a lot about it from the guide and if you go through a little gate to the derilect area you realise how vast the citadel really was. You need a few hours to see it properly it is really worth going.
"though the grounds are weed-ridden and in various states of disrepair depending on which part of the area you are exploring, the sheer breadth of the property, its history, and the hidden nooks and crannies make this a very interesting and picturesque place to visit."
"We hired 2 cyclo's, one having excellent english, to take us around the outer citadel area for 1 hour which was great and we saw a lot we didn't know about that had been part of the royal city area. We then went to the history museum where we bought a dual ticket then after the museum walked the 100m to the Citadel. We had been before but wanted to return as it is so interesting. It was very hot so we picked what parts we would look at this time and watched part of an excellent video presentation about the planning and building of the Citadel, which occurred over some time. My favourite part is the outer room where there are the large photos of life in the Citadel as well as some of the royal clothing.
It is a place you can visit many times and I look forward to returning and seeing how the restoration work is going."
"We walked to the Citadel from our hotel which took about 20 mins. We ignored the usual touts telling us it was closed and duly got there around midday paid the 55,000 vnd entry fee and enjoyed walking around the grounds very much. The most surprising and equally upsetting thing we saw were two elephants that were chained to trees for people to take pictures with and ride on. At first it was great to see then we realized that they were chained up which tarnished the initial elation. The rest of the grounds were very interesting and worth the entry fee. It seems a shame that the grandeur that the city once held was partly destroyed by war or natural disaster but it seemed as though they are rebuilding parts of it. Very much worth visiting a real delve into the past."
My friend and I visit Imperial city in last August. it was so hot. There are some interesting buildings in nice settings. I love resting in a pavilion listening its history (it is better if you have a tour guide). It took about 2 hour wandering here. I still want to revisit it.
"The citadel in Hue is a great place to visit and see or imagine how life would have been there centuries before. Set over a vast area with beautiful tree lined paths you can explore some beautiful buildings, temples and gardens.
It can be a photographers paradise. Just keep your distance from the large tour groups that don't see it all anyway. You should allow at least 2-3 hours to look around or longer if you can spare the time. Take plenty of water as Hue is a very hot place.
We have visited here 3 times and there is continuing renovations happening all the time.
A must vist place when in Hue."
"Of course the only reason to visit Hue is to see the Citadel. It is an amazing place to walk around and take in all the history and beautiful buildings. There is more work that needs to be done but its still worth it for sure. Bring water, it is hot. Be careful of the cyclo drivers who will tell you that its closed so they will take you around. Also note that cyclos are not allowed inside the Citadel at all - it is totally walking. The Citadel is the main attraction and is well worth it. Don't give the money clerk a large VND note to enter, she will say she don't have change and therefore short change you, as it happened to a couple at me hotel. It seems odd she wouldn't have change, but to be safe bring nothing larger than 100,000VND as the fee is 88,000VND."
"well worth the trip to see, there is a lot of ground to cover so wear walking shoes. There is lots of opportunity's for great photo,s. The history of the Citadel is better enhanced with a tour guide."
"Interesting building but as others say, much destroyed during the war. It's good that so much restoration work is ongoing and the site will be worth re-visiting in 3-5 years time."
"Our 2nd visit to the Citadel in 2 years and so much restoration work has been done it is amazing. You need to spend the time wandering from one residence to the next taking in the beautiful settings and architecture to really appreciate the place. So many people we saw only wandered around the central area and then left, but there is so much more to see and the peace and tranquility is a refreshing change from the noise of the street. We spent nearly 4 hours there relaxing in the shade and taking in the views. Be aware though that a scam is operating at the ticket desk (as mentioned in detail in a review below). We handed over 2 x 100K dong and she put one under the table and produced 1 x 100K note and a 10K note, we immediately told her we were aware of her scam and she said something like - it's not very much - implying I guess it's not very much for us tourists. She eventually gave us the right change as we stood our ground, but other tourists may not be so sure about the currency or what they gave her. She was trying to take for herself (and whoever else is involved) more than the cost of one entry fee of 80,000 dong. Best to buy tickets individually if in a group to avoid this."
But quite a disappointment inside as most of the palace were destroyed during the war.... But there is a miniature version of the palace before it was destroyed
Loved the citadel although the tour guide was not very good. I suggest you go here on your own rather than with a tour. There is a video explaining the history and some written information which was much more informative than our tour guide
Great to see the museum and the lovely gardens with the Elephants wandering around.
"We probably would have gotten more out of it if we had a guide, we attempted to tour this place on our own with the map, would suggest a guide though. Shame they don't have audio guides for hire and you could do it successfully yourself. It takes a long time, would suggest an umbrella and a hat as with all the stone and brick it gets very very hot."
"go on your own if you want to really appreciate this place. I spent 2 hours in there just wandering around, taking photos and savouring the atmosphere. You can hire a tour guide at the entrance if you wish and then spend time on your own afterwards looking around in depth"
"This city goes on and on! So many things to see within the walls. Area near the entrance also serves as community gathering place for families. Kite and toy vendors, with families flying kites in the garden area."
"A visit to the Citadel is well worth the entrance fee but beware when paying. Entrance fee is 80,000 dong per person. My wife handed over 500,000 for the 2 of us. The money went straight under the table and then she was asked for a further 10,000. When receiving the change there was a 10,000dong note stuck between a 200,000 and a 50,000 - should have been a 100,000 note. When we queried this the change disappeared under the table and the right change was subsequently given. We told our story to another Aussie couple that had also visited the Citadel the same day. They are sure they handed over a 200,000 note which subsequently disappeared under the table and then a 20,000 note appeared in the hand of the attendant which she claimed was all they had given her. They did not argue and paid another 140,000. Someone handling money constantly can identify the value of the note immediately without having to go through the charade of accepting it and then making it disappear. A one off or a scam; me thinks the latter. Unfortunately it reflects on all staff employed there. Hope this finds its way to the people who can do something about it. This occurred Friday 18 May and we entered around 10.30am."
"Very impressive, reminscent of the Forbidden City in Beijing. Still being renovated after the war damage, but they are progressing well and still plenty to see, Allocate a couple of hours at least."
"Huge complex, very well preserved and being reconstructed after the long battle between US troops and Viet Cong in '68. So much to see it seems to go on and on. We did enjoy an elephant ride on the grounds."
there has been so much damage to this site from the war that you need to use your imagination when looking around. there are still plenty of interesting buildings and it is worth the visit. i can imagine that it would have been very grand in its day.
"The Citadel is a must if you are going to Hue, but there isn't much else in the city to commend a visit. Best visit the Citadel on a drive through or stay one night only. The Pagoda on the river is excellent, but unless you really must, the royal tombs further up the river can be missed.
A note of warning for hungry and thirsty trippers leaving the Citadel (it gets very hot in there) in search of sustenance - just outside the Ngan Gate next to the Vientin Bank is a small fast food joint called the Kem Cafe Sihn To. Don't use it, the lady who runs it is a robber. She charged us 5* hotel prices for the beer.
Vote with your feet and walk on by."
"Well, it's a citadel...in every sense of the word. Awesome, huge...you could spend a day wondering around. There is a video that shows you in how life was lived in the citadel was in 3d animated reconstruction (you will find it in one of the halls when you enter the citadel proper). I was glad I watched it, it helped to imagine how grand and interesting life was there hundreds of years ago. The stony grandeur of the Citadel and lovely Khai Dinh tomb were my favourite places to visit in Hue."
A must visit - and a must to have a good guide to tell you the exact story. There's a lot of hidden history which a guide should but not always explains. Don't let them rush you through the tour. Lots of photo opportunities. Be sure to try to get in one of the performances if you can.
The Citadel covers a vast area and there is a lot to see - allow at least half a day. There is a great video detailing the architectural features of the main buildings. Take the time to visit the outer buildings which are less crowded. Only down side is there seemed to be a gift shop in almost every building. If you're inclined you can play dress-ups and have your photo taken in a replica emperor's chair.
Very hot day when we were there but enjoyed our visit a lot.
Needs renovation and at least a few information boards.huge dissapointment as it's said to be the biggest atraction in hue...
"Only few buildings in the Imperial Enclosure have survived and they are really beautiful. For the biggest part this part of the Citadel is destroyed and walking around was not very special. However, there are audiovisual displays that show how the whole complex used to be. This gives you a nice impression. We expected a little bit more."
"This is the most important reason to come to Hue, I think.
Some of it got hurt during the war."
"As a sightseeing venue this is undoubtebly impressive. We went there couple of hours before closing and this was clearly insufficient to go through the entire site. So save some time as the place is huge.

P.S. Just a word of caution (and the reason why this is not a 5* review). Both the seller of water outside the place and the ticket seller at the gate tried to run the shortchanging scam. First was successful, the other wasnt. While one could expect this from street vendor, this completely unexpected and unacceptable at the ticket entrance."
"I really enjoyed going through this complex slowly and deliberately. You can envision what it must have been like during the Emperors time. I hope they continue the renovation so the entire complex is brought back to life as much as possible. Don't rush, take your time exploring. Lovely grounds to wander in."
A beautiful palace that was built in the modern times. The sad part is that this historical building is very poorly maintained. I wish the Vietnamese government would maintain and restore this historical palace
"Very interesting. Make sure to leave enough time to see everything. We only had 2 hours, which wasn't enough. The site is huge."
Leave plenty of time to visit this Heritage Listed complex as there is so much to see.
"Make sure you are taken through the entire site, as there are many interesting gardens and ponds and peaceful places. We got the impression that many visitors did not go to the entire site. Much is still to be restored."
Very large complex - need a good couple of hours to see it all which in the heat can be challenging but worth it.
"I found the Citadel really interesting part of Hue's history. Whilst some of the parts have been damaged I really enjoyed seeing this place. It really needs some restoration work to happen plus also some written guides to help you navigate through this huge area.

We made sure that we read about the place before we went in and studied the map at the entrance.

Tips- get there early to beat the heat and know what you want to see."
"Enjoyed seeing the traditional buildings, would like to see the citadel in a couple of years when it is fully restored"
"Hugh Complex, very interesting but not possible to see it all unless you spend a whole day."
"Although this can't truly compare to Beijings Forbidden City, it is potentially very beautiful . With further restoration, it will become a little brother to the Chinese Forbidden City. .

It is worth going very early In the morning as by noon, it is searingly hot..... Allow plenty of time for walking around the whole site."
This is quite a feature; make sure you have good walking shoes and your camera at the ready!
Great to visit the Citadel as they were setting up for the festival. Seeing it on TV that night was fun as we had seen all the preparations earlier in the day.
"need more than 2 hours to visit the place and the best is study the history of this place. As at there, do not have leaflet to explain this historical place."
"Maybe it would be different on a guided tour, but we found that we were just walking among big ruined buildings without much context. No single building was as striking as other things we saw in Vietnam and the natural environment wasn't as nice as out at the Tu Duc tombs. Our favorite part was the burned building near the back of the citadel which provided the most striking contrast of colors."
"Very interesting to visit & really a must do in Hue. We visited in early May, it was over 35degrees even at 8am when we got there! We found it too hot & uncomfortable to spend a long time looking at ruins. Go early to avoid big tour groups."
Forget sleep...you are on vacation and the Hue Imperial Palace (aka The Citadel) is well worth an early morning visit and a full day tour. Be sure to check out the Vietnam War portions surrounding the main palace...!!
"The imperial city was heavily damaged during the American war (you can see some photos taken during the battle for Hue in the War Remnants Museum in HCMC). Only a few buildings are original and recontruction continues. Allow yourself 2-3 hours to visit this site, it is huge. Go early as much of the site is exposed and it gets very hot."
"Ignoring the entrance being decorated with lighting for a Concert, the rest was simply stunning from almost every standpoint - architecture, size, scale, number of folks housed, delicate craftsmanship in wood, steel, and stone - the list goes on and on.

Take all cameras, go early to get the best light and enjoy."
"Situated in the heart of Hue the Citadel offers a great insight to the local history and architecture of the area. Once you enter you can stroll around the courtyard, feed the hungry koi fish in the pond, or even ride an elephant around the area for a different viewpoint. Otherwise you can make your way into the inner part of the Citadel and stroll around the rooms, hallways, and courtyards there. If you are in a hurry you can do this in about 45 minutes, otherwise plan to spend some time and take it all in."
"The citadel is the old Emperor's residence in Hue, and was heavily damaged during the Vietnam war. Its mostly been well restored and is an impressive place to visit. Its the key place to visit in Hue."
"Spend a morging in the citadel. A lot has been destroyed but what is left is worth the visit: Besides, it is nice to have walk in this quiet area."
"Very interesting but there were preparations for the Hue festival taking place so it was very busy.
It would have been nice to have clearer descriptions on what areas were original and which had been rebuilt and when."
"The Citadel impressed us, but mostly from the outside. Becase the Hue festival was held during our visit we could not visit the inner circle. Pity. Be warned. Lucky enough the next edition of the festival will be held in 2014, so plenty of time for a propher visit."
"We chose not to pay the entrance fees during the city tour, opting instead to visit the Citadel and Imperial City another morning at our own pace. This was a right decision as you really cannot comprehensively cover this venue in only one hour. If you are not at liberty to take your time exploring this , would suggest you focus on several key sites here - the noon gate (which is the entrance where they sell tickets) making sure to climb to the second level. Then, cover the Hall of Supreme Harmony which is directly ahead of the Noon Gate after crossing the bridge. Next walk through the walls into the Forbidden purple city where you will see the mandarin houses on the left and right. Most of the rest of the emperors quarters in the purple city have been destroyed. You should stop though to see the interior of the Royal Theatre. After that, cut back towards the direction of the Noon Gate where you came from and head towards the right side (if you are facing the Noon Gate with your back towards the Hall of Supreme Harmony) where you must see the Temple of Generations and the nine Dynastic Urns. It would be a good idea to go to the Citadel with your guidebook and map of the important buildings to avoid walking around in circles especially if the temp is 40 degrees :-)"
"It is simply an intriguing insight into Vietnamese culture. Shame so much damage was caused during the conflict, but restotration is under way and in a few years this will be magnificent."
"Take your time, pay for a guiide and explore this old Imperial City. only 50 years ago there was a Monarch based here"
"One major regret during my visit to Hue was not having enough time to truly enjoy this magnificent imperial city. A short visit during a tour does not give this place enough justice. However, the tour guide's information and explanation of its history would definitely increase everyone's appreciation towards its beauty and also how saddening it is to know that something that was once so grand and majestic is nearly brought to total ruin because of war. So do take the tour for the information but come back and take your time to truly appreciate the site."
"The bits we found were great, but never did find the 9 dynastic urns!
Felt like we were back there in time. Perhaps we needed a detailed map, our general one didn't really help us very much. Still the wanderng along the river, and inside the citadel was great."
We visited The Citadel as part of a full day city tour and we spent about 45 mins walking through the site. Apparently UNESCO has given funding for a full renovation of the site as some parts are fairly decayed. There was a couple of elephants chained up on grassland at the rear of the site which was upsetting to see.
The Citadel will take you a good morning/afternoon to visit - but it is well worth walking around all the pagodas and buildings. Good to see there are some original bits remaining and have not been covered up. The lotus lilies and elephants are very enchanting. Visit the top of the gatehouse - you will get a great view of the site from the top.
Historically extremely interesting. Wandering around the grounds of the Citadel enabled us to capture some feeling about what this must have been like in its prime.
"Visited Hue Imperial City in April as part of a 12 day stay in Hoi An. Recommend that the tour be conducted with the assistance of a tour guide. Most of the complex was apparently destroyed during the Tet Offensive of 1968, however the remaining buildings provide a tantalising taste of the former opulence enjoyed by Vietnamese Royalty. Whilst in Hue you should take the time to visit the Royal tombs and Phu Cam Cathedral. Allow for a full day if travelling from Hoi An."
"We were there in 38 degrees of heat so a hat .plenty of water and sunscreen was a must because much of this very large site is unshaded.
Luckily our guide spoke English well and had good knowledge of the history of the Imperial City, and there is a lot of it ,we used the Exotissimo tour company and can speak highly of them.
Allow several hours to explore the citadel and absorb the colorful history."
"Some buildings have been reconstructed, but essentially it's a large empty area. Should go there if you are in Hue anyway but don't plan in too much time and avoid the midday heat as the sun can be unforgiving."
While visitng Hue as family with a small baby boy we felt the imperial city was great to see and it was definitly worth it. While the rest of Hue seemed mostly stressful this is the best highlight to visit.
"Very impressive. Loved the old walls, the buildings inside - it's just got that feeling of something ancient and eternal. If you go there between 5.30 and 6.30am you will see a lot of local people walking and exercising. Just great!"
"This was a really interesting spot to visit in Hue. Walking through the imperial city(which isn't that large) was a nice chance to get away from the busy city and traffic and have a quiet peaceful walk.
They were also offering elephant rides when we were there, and even if you don't want to go for a ride they are still interesting to see.
Worth the visit."
"Lots of things to see here, the rooms and the history of this place is fascinating, when you walk around, take note of all the damage done during the Vietnam war, you will see bullet marks on all kinds of things."
"A bit disappointing but again i only spent 90 mins with the tour guide as we were doing the City tour, so it was quite expensive as the price had risen (3 days before apparently) from 55 to 80 000 dong, so i did not go back the next day to explore more but interesting to see as it looks like those big palace in the Chinese movies!"
This is a very large and popular tourist site. Need to allow plenty of time to take it all in
This was a somber visit. To see the destruction that my country did to this beautiful place made me sick. I hope the country soon will have the funds to refurbish it and restore it to something like it was.
"We were there on an extremely hot day. take an umbrella if you have one, helps keep you cooler than just a hat. Right in the city so it's easy to walk to. Interesting, we didn't get a guide and wish we had though. It was huge and interesting to look at, but we didn't appreciate what we were seeing. Elephant rides there. Felt sorry for elephants. I saw no water for them"
It is very big in size allow time to view and make sure exhibits are open
Because the Hue festival was on it was possible to visit the citadel at night. It was wonderful with lots of entertainment and wonderfully lit. We actually went back next day and it was still interesting but not 'magical' in the same way.
This place is huge if you really see the whole thing. We went without a guide and although I'm sure we missed some of the history there are signs in English in all of the important places and it was nice to be able to go at our own pace.
"You really need a couple of days to get around this complex; it's giant and there is a lot to see. We were there during the Festival Huế, so there was a lot of extra scaffolding around which detracted a bit from the site."
"Enjoyed it, lots to walk around, a good bit renovated, sadly parts of it destroyed during the War... But they had a huge LCD TV which showed you it in it's glory days and had a story about it, but to get the full benefit of it we recommend you get a tour guide, we were only there for a short time but you could spend a good few hours there."
"Beautiful buildings and grand scale of the grounds were a delight to wonder around in. We went during the Hue festival, so got to see it twice, both at night and during the day. The Forbidden Purple City where the emperor, wives and eunuchs lived is mostly in ruins though; weather in April rather hot and humid so any trips made best done in the early morning or late afternoon."
"The Citadel is enormous, you need a good couple of hours to get around it all. It is quite fascinating to hear the history and picture the life at the time whilst knowing that it was less than 100 years ago and people still lived like this.
Downside - very, very hot and not much shade
Highlight - two elephants walking around the grounds!"
"Warned that there is nearly nothing left of the Imperial city we discovered the opposite. Our visit took one whole day and it was not enough. Go there now before it´s restored, repainted and well guarded. Good place to buy books about Hue by Vietnamese authors."
"We visited as they were preparing for a festival so there was a lot of scaffold at the entrance and a large stage. Once inside though, you felt transported back hundreds of years (when the place is not actually that old) and our guide was excellent at bringing the place to life for us."
"We went by ourselves and just walked around with a guidebook. While I'm sure there were some insights we missed, we did enjoy it a lot.

Tip: Walk the perimeter. It gets you away from the crowds and you get to have more of it to yourself. You'll also find a live, chained elephant in one of the corners."
"You need to be a child with an incredible imagination to realize how was the citadel 50 years ago. There are few buildings worth the visit and you will be surprised for the amount of rubbish in some places.
The local employees cook and clean close the some buildings. Some of the temple/palace rooms are occupied by food & beverages sellers, which increase the general decay.
There is no clear english signs or map leaflet.

The guides wouldn't be expensive (200.000VND) if they could communicate more than the fee in English.

It is not worthy the visit and the 55000VND entrance fee. You should spend your time visiting any other location in Hue or planning the next local Vietnamese restaurant for the night."
Spent a very happy 3 hours pottering around the complex. When you get through the main gate ( by the Flag pole ) please go left as far as you can go. There is a complex of buildings there that are spectacular and not well visited ( seems as if most people miss it ). I and my son loved it especially as we saw what looked like a red Tardis ! Children are free which makes a very nice change
"Best way to see the area is to rent a motorbike or at least a bike as it is huge. Smaller and bigger street, local people just living there lives. Had trouble finding a place to eat but maybe we just went too far from the Purple City."
"Take your time and spend a whole day here. There is much more to see than the hurried tours will let you. There are places to get a bite to eat or a cold drink, and wandering the more overgrown areas really gives you a better flavor of this extensive site. Look for the elephants offering rides and lawn mowing services! Tip for the not so bright, never rush up to a napping elephant squealing, we saw two Western ladies doing just this silly thing, and they got a nasty shock when the large bull elephant opened his ears and lifted his trunk at them as if about to stampede!"
This is the place to visit if you travel to Hue which is famous for the Nguyen Dynasty
"Such a big attraction, and a trip to Hue is not really complete without visiting the citadel. The one thing that I was a bit uncomfortable with was the elephant rides that were offered on two fed-up looking elephants, that were tied to a tree with chains. They looked a bit forlorn."
"Didn't really find the Citadel all that enthralling, to tell you the truth..."
it is an impressive monument and tells of the great history of hue
"This is a very interesting site with lots of history. Definitely worth a visit. What was interesting to us, was to be able to compare it to the Forbidden City in Beijing which we had visited the week before."
"Get a guide when you first go in. They are very informative. Whilst much of teh Citadel has been destroyed through the actions of war, there is enough heer to make a 3 hour visit well worth it."
"An interesting site, good to compare with the Forbidden Palace in Beijing if you've been there. Be aware that most of it is ruins though. The theatre is quite impressive and it's a nice place to walk around for an afternoon."
Very interesting sigth. We spent 4 hours and only left because it was very hot. Remember to bring food - there are no restaurants inside.
"Although a mini-mini version, not as aged and much destroyed, the Imperial City has parallels to Beijing's Forbidden City. The imposing flag tower and Five Phoenix Watchtower above the main gateway give an impression of the grandeur that once was. What remains (or has been rebuilt) is interesting but one needs to use much imagination for the vast stretches of bare ground, a tragic casualty of war."
"Much of the Citadel is still being rebuilt and restored after the various wars and decay in their aftermath, but its still got more than enough remaining to give a sense of the grandeur and spectacle of the area."
"The Citadel has some buildings that were clearly damaged by bombing but I think this makes the place more authentic. Its great to just stroll around for a few hours, and yes there are taxis outside all competing for your business. Just walk away if you're afraid of being ripped off."
It's simply amazing to see the grand stonework of centuries past. I enjoyed our visit to the Imperial City as much as I did our visit to Ankor Wat.
Lots of potential here but lots of work required thanks to damage done by bombings. Cyclo drivers are a real pain outside also
"If you are going without a guide, it is worth reading up on the history of the place and watching the short film when you arrive that explains about the complex. Much of the area was destroyed by war, so many places are in the process of being restored-- it doesn't take long to get the idea. So, if you don't make it there until 4pm, don't worry--you can still get a worthwhile visit in before it closes."
"On its own, the historical presence is strong and the citadel holds a lot of information and experiences. However since the bombing of 1975. most of the buildings are reduced to ruins. The city of Hue is trying to rebuild it but the newly painted celings, columns takes away from the nostalgia of the citadel. Must see though - there are some buildings that are magnificent. Just don't be too excited lol"
"There are I think two basic ways to visit this place. One is simply to walk around (some information is in english) admire the decoration at the restored buildings and enjoy the tranquility of it all (due to the size the tourists do not crowd too much) with all the green areas inside. You will have impressive and delicate decorations to look at, nice architecture and can have a very nice time.

The other would be to take a guide and let you explain and ask questions, as to why this lake is shaped in that way, how does the vietnamese numerology influences what you see, how was the life for the emperor, why have there been 13 emperors, but there are only 9 urns and 10 altars for them, what do the decorations represent and a lot more.

The whole place is full of history and culture and if you want to immers into it that may be the top place for you to do so. Highly recommended both way either the wander around and enjoy or the inquisitive and learning,

Be aware that you will spend a lot of time in the sun, there are steps to navigate to get inside the buildings and that the pathways often are rugged so with the long ways (all in all you will walk about 1.5 km) some sturdy shoes are required and the ability to walk a bit. Make sure to take off your shoes before you enter temples.

Together with the tombs in the vicinity surely worth a daytrip from Hoi An. One thing of course: Most of the buildings are restored and some restoration is just going on and a lot still needs to be restored."
"We enjoyed going through this. We chose not to use a guide and instead made it our own ""adventure."" The signage was adequate enough for this, but some googling was required on our return to find info that a good guide could have told us.

The citadel is in various states of decay, but overall it is quite an interesting look into the politics and social aspects of Vietnam less than 100 years ago.

Just beware of the cyclo drivers waiting at the exit!"
"We spent a good 4 hours enjoying the calmness , peacefulness and serenity of this amazing historic place -- once we had got past the souvenir sellers and bike tours outside.
The two films that are run in one of the buildings are very interesting. It is also cheap to get in and is a good area to take in a picnic and soft drinks. It does need some investment on signage and decent maps are not available on site."
"Very busy place, get there early. Buildings under repair, some foundations only of some buildings"
"Definitely a must see - Vietnam's very own Forbidden City - but this place is not as vast, so it's much more easier to walk about."
Worth seeing and very interesting. It is just enormous and you should give yourselves a few hours to see it all.
"Far, far better than the Forbidden City in Beijing, even though so much of it has been damaged by bombing in various wars ( there is an on-going reconstruction ).The film explaining the layout and history is good - we dont get a guide when we go to places like this ( we travel independently, not with tour groups ) as we have had bad experiences in the past.
The art gallery which is tucked away and not visited by tour groups because 'there is no time' SHOULD be included on tour group itineraries - the paintings are by ex students of the Hue Fine Art section of the University and are fabulous and incredibly well priced. The curator is charming and canvases can be packed while you wait. Art is a part of Vietnam's heritage and as much attention should be paid to it as architecture and history !"
"Strolking the grounds of the Imperial City you cannot help but wonder how wonderful life in the early 19th century might have been provided you were an emperor. Some of the sights are surprisingly well preserved, others unfortunately totally destroyed during the war. You can see, hiwever, the continuous effort to restore the original glory of this beautiful sight"
Our trip was consisted of a group of West Point Grads and several former Green Berets. We not only understood the importance of the Citadel in the past but also of the turbulent times during the Vietnam War. I was pleased to see that the site is being rebuilt from photos taken prior to the intense battle that was fought there in 1968. UNESCO has it's place around the world and it is pleasing to know that an organization restores such sites so my children and grandchildren to come will have a chance to visit such rich cultural sites.
"The citadel is most grand viewed from the Ngo Gate. Inside the citadel, the Taiho hall in the centre and the temples to the left are well preserved. the supposedly royal residence area was wiped during the vietnam war. The arrangement of the whole place is exactly the same as the forbidden city in beijing. Hue cidatel is the mini version. If you have not been to Beijing, it is good to view. otherwise, you may be a bit disappointed.

I rode a bicycle there from Hue city centre, only about 10-15 mins causual ride. unfrotunately, it was raining during that day, otherwise it would be a lot more enjoyable.

There is a small store selling stamps just outside the main citadel gate, with bicycle parking. This is one of the best places to buy stamps if you are a stamps collector. The other place being the small shop outside HCM museum in Hanoi. You can also send the postcard there."
"A huge site in which you can wander for hours, but desperately in need of more care. The gardens are unkempt and overgrown and many of buildings are in complete disrepair. Some restoration is taking place but the pace seems woefully slow. If you are ony in Hue for a short stay visit the tombs of Khai Dinh and Tu Duc rather than this."
Ok here but not much english to explain what is what? Not as well maintained as i would have thought! The gardens is what i mean by that! Nice walk around the moat on the outside.
"WOW
We went with a tour and spent about 1 hour with a english speaking guide but you could easily spend half to full day here just casually walking around taking in the exibits."
"Lots of it destroyed in the war, but now under renovation. The areas of the forbidden city clearly showed the grandeur of the Kings. Well worth the visit"
"The place reminds us of Forbidden city in Beijing, only smaller. This is where the Nguyen Dynasty, the Emperor & his family lived, and called the Purple Forbidden City, and the structures that remained show wear & tear over the years. Still, worth a visit due to its significance."
The Citadel and the Forbidden City located within the Citadel provides an awesome view into the rich history of the kings for Vietnam (13 in total) who have lived in this awesome location. Take a tour guide so that you get to appreciate the rich history of this place.
"We hired a cyclo for the trip around the Citadel which was great as its so big and would have taken us hours. Agree on a price before you get on, just make sure its not per hour."
Our guide was well acquainted with this site and helped make our visit a pleasure. There is still a great deal of restoration work planned so it will be worth another visit in later years.
Its big enough to get lost in and more importantly lose the crowds. The American bombs made a proper mess of it in the war but that gives it a certain rustic splendour and allows you to go and chill out in the more deserted areas and imagine what it must have looked like in it's hey-day.
Vast grounds and buildings . Groups were practicing for April festival in costume with music accompliment . Some buildings and areas still under repair
"This might have been more beautiful and, in some ways, more interesting than the Forbidden City in Beijing. Really beautiful architecture."
"A magnificent complex, that is being updated all of the time to try and rebuild it back to its former glory. Wander off and go where people aren't to experience the massive shelling it must have received. Quite an experience"
"Ok so travelling around other countries I have come across many sub standard tourist attractions when compared to London tourist sights. But this was pretty disappointing.

As this is meant to be the main tourist attraction in. Hue I would have thought that it would be a little better than what it is. So most of the palace has been destroyed through neglect and the wars but there weren't even very many signposts pointing you in the right direction and only some basic signs explaining what buildings used to be at certain sites in the palace grounds.

If you've been to any of the forbidden cities in China then this will be a massive disappointment - being much smaller and very dilapidated.

If you're in Hue then it's a must see as there isn't much else around to see but if you're thinking of stopping in Hue just to see this then it's not really worth it!

The Vietnamese tourism industry seems to have a very long way to go when compared to neighbouring countries like Cambodia and Laos."
This site was wonderful inspite of the devastation caused by American bombs. Kudos to the countries who are helping to rebuild this amazing place.
"Loved the few hours spent here. Wish we had more time. A peaceful and serene place, easy to navigate and enjoy. Highly recommend"
Provided an interesting window into history of Vietnam. Well worth a visit.
"Lots to see, pleasant to walk around and imagine what it must have been like."
"very impressive entrance to this bastion, good details and plaques with explanations & history, well serviced and the koi are a nice touch. Beyond the Citadel, the whole area opens and welcomes"
was an interesting place to check out for the afternoon. You can dress in traditional dress and get your pictures taken. The best part for us was checking out the traditional dance show at the theater.
"The citadel is really impressive, if you can find it!"
A MUST see. The powerful history of this historical place is unbelievable. It gave me a knew interest and insight to where the proud people of Vietnam came from.
"Two words come to mind when it comes to the Imperial City: ""Majestic"" and ""Superhotweather!"" great place to learn about the history of vietnamese emperors and see the forbidden city (take lots of pictures!), but the weather was so hot that by the end of it i was exhausted just by sweating.
You can see the houses for the kings, mistresses, where the eunuchs roamed. They also have a large courtyard for animal fighting in those 'Gladiator' days. You can almost feel like you're transported into a different time zone while you imagine the lifestyle people had within the Impreial city those days.
Great place, but not necessary unless you do have time to spare."
"The Citadel and Imperial city are definitely a must see in Hue. The area is not well sign posted (but you will know where to go when you see the moat and wall), otherwise most hotels have maps. Its not expensive and it is beautiful inside. There are no maps or indications as to what building was what on all of them. Highly recommended."
"Visited it in the afternoon on our first day in Hue. Surprisingly, there was quite a lot to see with many photo opportunities but photography was not allowed in the main buildings. The library building was closed for restoration but there were many other restored buildings and parts that could be visited. In one of the mandarins' halls after the impressive throne hall, there were exhibits of porcelain and photographs. At the royal theatre, there was a rehearsal with pop music blaring so loudly that we could hear it from the compound outside. The temple where the emperors were worshipped was beautifully decorated and furnished and even had photographs of some of the rulers. Even the ruins, many gateways and imperial pleasure pool were picturesque in their own way. Wander around and you can easily lose the crowds. A must-visit in Hue."
Having seen the forbidden city of Beijing I was a little bit dispointed of the imperial city in Hue. It is nice to see for those who haven't been to Beijing yet.
"This is like a miniature of Forbidden City in Beijing. Beautiful decoration, you can learn about all emperors of Vietnam. Inside of the palace is not really well-kept, we were there on a rainy day and most of the walking paths are slippery. Wear a comfort shoes to walk inside."
"The former Imperial capital is in the centre of Hue and is easily seen by walking. Size wise it is considerably smaller than Beijing's Forbidden City and nowhere near as grand. However this should not put one off visiting. Huge damage was done during the 1968 Tet offensive but there is enough remaining, including some old palaces to give the visitor a taste of what was there in its glory days. The Ngo Mon gate and Thai Hoa palace are very impressive. The whole site could be done in 2 to 3 hours."
"The sites in Hue are excellent --- it is definitely worth
the trip."
"You can visit the Citadel as part of a day package that includes a dragon boat trip on the Perfume River and visits to a couple of pagodas and some old Imperial tombs but if you do you will get very little time there and you really need to spend at least a couple of hours to see all the wonders of the site, which is extensive despite extensive bomb damage from the War in the 1960s. It is easy to get to from the area where most hotels are located (short taxi ride for around 40,000 VND) and well worth seeing. If you feel the need for a guide, there are plenty willing to offer their services at the Citadel."
One of the mainattraction of Hue its very impressive and large. Shame not all buildings are there any more but whats standing is really awesome!
"This feels like a miniature (and more humane) version of the Forbidden City in Beijing. We enjoyed particularly the Emperor's Mother's residence. Unfortunately, most of the original buildings were destroyed, with some being reconstructed now."
complex almost as large as Beijing Forbidden city. The temple complex on the far side was fascinating and beautiful. The women's area was lovely.
"i've not been to the forbidden city in china, so this complex is simply amazing. perhaps the one in beijing can rival it.

it is grand beyond words. it is unfortunate most of the place is flatten now due to bombings during vietnam war, but the most decorated building is 100% intact. it is a shame that they are trying to rebuild everything from scratch. it covers the real history, but then again, pieces of flat land doesn't tell a lot, too."
"I feel peaceful and easy feeling when I was in Hue- much more so than other cities in Vietnam. It's considered a University town so there are many students here- in that regard- it's vibrant but not obnoxious. The people walk a different pace here and it strikes me that although change is in the air. Most impressive to me and the most famous landmark in the complex is the Ngo Mon Gate - the majestic entrance to the Citadel. I explored The Citadel by bike because lager vehicles are not allowed inside the complex. I visited many attractions such as: Palace of Supreme Harmony, Dynastic Temple, The Nine Dynastic, The Forbidden Purple City...That's wonderful"
A lovely old place to see how the early dynasties of Vietnam lived.
"The Imperial City is not the most interesting site to visit in Hue. Most of it is quite disapointing because there is not much to see.
It's much better to spend more time visiting the various tombs"
"I had the enormous good fortune to be on the tour with a young man from Saigon, who was very generous with his knowledge of the history of the Citadel. With his help, the place came alive, and although the tour guide we had engaged was nowhere to be seen, the history and prevailing customs were engaging. I want to come back when the restoration is complete."
I visited the Citadel on 3rd of Feb. It was drizzling but it was a very good 2 hour trip. The moat outside the citadel is gorgeous.. the buildings within the citadel are beautiful and walkways are just so nice. Some of the parts have been ruined but it is worth the walk all round. Enjoy the place and give yourself time. lots of history and culture at this place.
"You'll only need a couple of hours to cover this site. It's a must see, but because it has been destroyed so many time over the years, only slice of it's original form is left.

Top tip: there is a video showing a digital reconstruction of what it did look like back in the day. I found it really very useful in terms of visualising what it was like before it was ruined.

Second top tip: You can dress up as an emperor which is not only hilarious but means you can get some great photos too."
"If you are looking for Buckingham palace it's not,half was destroyed in the war,"
"Okay, really enjoyed riding the elephant and feeling like a princess, also got there early before the tourist buses. It's a beautiful, ancient and peaceful place."
same as above. A beautiful place. Well worth seeing.
Loved the history of Vietnam and this site had it all. One can only marvel at the amazing feat of building such a palace. Take your time when visiting.
Although much of the sight needed restoration it was still a beautiful experience
"i have to confess that i expected something more... probably too much. the citadel is a huge piece of vietnam history but after two wars is still paying the bill. i really enjoyed the digital recostruction that korean government gave to hue, at least it gives u an idea of the marvellous things u could have found in the past here. i think they should cure a bit more, probably organizing much more interesting guide tours."
this was a great stop and there is so much to see here you could spend literally hours looking and walking thru it.
nothing much to see besides boring buildings simply architected. nothing left from the glorious past. not worth the time nor the money (55k vnd)
"I found that the imperial city of Hue is average to visit as the best part is only at the front entrance of the forbbiden city entrance near the Huang river (Ngo Moon Gate). There are not much at the center of the citadel.

Tips : We went to the WC in the center of the Citadel which are not recommended cause it is a instant toilet. Try the better WC at the gate near the royal theatre if you are looking for the WC or toilet or restroom."
"The Imperial city was very impressive and they have worked hard to restore this historical landmark which is well worth the visit. You probably only need about an hour to walk around the place.

Ignore any touts outside or anyone offering to cycle you around the city. Just walk straight up to the front gate and pay your entrance fee. Ladies do not need to worry about covering up either."
My 2 Daughters (22 & 19) and myself spent a whole day here. Whilst the central part of the Citadel was quite busy we were lucky enough to have met someone the day before who told us to explore out both sides of the complex also. Once you got out on the edges there was hardly any tourists and every corner there was more to see. We really enjoyed a quiet day taking our time to see this amazing place.
"do not miss the temple complex - this was the most interesting part of the visit, partially restored but very atmospheric.
The throne room in the main building is very well done.
If you have a drink at the outside cafe, check the price first - they seem to give a tourist price if you don't!"
"If you been to Beijing Forbidden City, I don't think you will enjoy Hue Imperial City.

I'm pretty disappointed as I thought Vietnam Tourism Authority should do more to preserve this heritage for next generation."
I wish the Vietnamese Government would spend some money to restore this landmark. It is part of the country's history. It is such as shame that it has been left for ruin.
"Theres a lot of interesting history to be learned from in side the city walls. There is a lot to see whilst wandering around however a lot of the good stuff costs quite a bit of money, well not really much unless your a traveller on a budget and then 55000dong is a lot to you. It does seem very old and fragile but its clean and obviously cared about. It is the main attraction in Hue, its what you go to see really."
"It was very interesting, unfortunately we did not get to see a great deal of the Citadel. This was because our tour guide was in a big hurry and thought we only needed to see bits and pieces. What we did see however, was very interesting and good."
"Restored and well managed. Of course it could do with some extra funding for maintenance, however, it's easy to overlook the wear and tear, and see a magnificent and historically important site. And, no motorbikes!!"
"Get a cyclo ( negotiate beforehand) and visit the fascinating forbidden city, it is a gem, cannot believe the Americans bombed it in the 70s, the holes are still there and it needs international attention to be repaired abnd brought to its former glory, and glory it was!"
"Great to walk around and enjoy this amazing historical site. The cyclo drivers can rip you off, so beware."
"Make sure to allot plenty of time to visit this amazing, extensive site--I spent three hours one day and went back for an hour (with a tour) the next day. Worth every minute. Walk around--visit the main, restored sites, but don't neglect hidden little areas, not yet restored, that are full of charm. Amazing colors, from the bright green mossy walls to the yellow and red imperial colors on the restored buildings. A must-see!"
"Spent a very pleasant morning exploring the complex. It is a huge complex , with a lot of it badly damaged during the Vietnam War. But nevertheless there are some beautiful old buildings/temples around. There is a lovely cafe at the North Entrance where one can have a drink and people watch. We ended the trip with lunch at Lac Thanh restaurant (run by a deaf-mute family) , which is on the way back across the Perfume River."
"If you are staying in Hue then it is worth walking to the Citadel and paying the low entrance fee. Once there, there isn't much to keep you entertained - the real highlight was that there weren't any motorbikes there meaning that you could actually walk without being beeped at."
Major parts of this world heritage site are unfortenately falling to pieces by water damage which is quite sad to witness. Specially when it was helped being renovated by UNESCO but there seem to be no one around who would be interested of keeping it up. Disappointing!
"We didn't have much time to spend in Hue so we decided to sample the attractions in one day, and The Citadel was one of them. This turns out to be a tiny regret because the place is gorgeous and it's worth exploring for hours, even a picnic if the weather is right. So if you're in Hue, just hop on a taxi (they are very reliable and affordable there) and go straight to The Citadel. You only have to pay a fee of 55000 dong to enter so go ahead, have fun."
The reason the visit Hue and well worth the hours spent on the bus. The Imperial city covers a vast area and your really need at least 1/2 a day to explore it.
We enjoyed the Cidadel and got some great family photos. Allow a few hours to go through though. There is a fee on entry also.
We thoroughly enjoyed walking around the Citadel and the Imperial Palace within the Forbidden City. Although much of it was destroyed through bombing enough remains and is being restored to give a great insight into the Emporer's living quarters. It was also nice to be able to wander around without any traffic. Gill and John
"As I wanted to pay to get in the Citadel the front desk lady changed quickly the 100.000 VND bill to a 10.000 VND what made me feel bad. , and had to pay more than double to get . SO BE CAREFUL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The site has very poor signs and is not easy to know where you are once you are in because it is too big. We should get a map on the entrance, as we pay to get in"
"This place maybe too muddy to walk around in wet seasons. Not all places have proper pavements, at times you have to walk on the bare ground with lots of tall weeds too.The Royal Theater is the best place to visit in my view. Rest of the buildings are bare except for its structure."
great time to travel at Tet as local families are visting the complex and its surrounds
The citadel is amazing when you realize that it has been almost destroyed twice. It is a huge complex where the king and his family lived and is steeped in history. Take your time and stroll around the vast area and try to imagine what it was like in its glory days
"The gift shop charges many times more than other shops. Some REAL GOOD ADVICE: the best and by far the cheapest place to buy gifts is Halong Bay. You can get the exact, same gifts as offered in any other area of Vietnam but much, much less expensive."
"Impressive buildings, content inside not a great deal, could be improved"
Interesting but a more ambitious level would be good
This is a great historical site and well worth visiting. Many buildings are being restored to their former glory and walking around this huge site shows just how impressive it would have been centuries ago. Make sure you watch the audio visual presentation which traces the history with great illustrations of the entire site. On the walk back stop for a drink at the riverside restaurant at the foot of the bridge which takes you back to town.
"A very impressive historical site. This was a beautiful place to visit. You can see the battle between nature and the restorers. Moss and lichens, some damage from the war, and beautiful architecture with regal touches (rooves are yellow tiles to signify the presence of the king). This place really suits photographers as you can wander at wil and the scenery is classicl."
"Nicely preserved complex with nice examples of architecture - both buildings and landscape, nice gardens to wander around and full access to all buildings. Great example of feng-shui applied in the design of the building and complex"
Would have liked some signs to tell us what different things are. It just goes on and on and you could get a little lost. Interesting enough to spend about 3 hours there.
"Don't miss this complex. It does help to have a guide explain what you are seeing. Be careful walking if it rains, as the tiles are slippery."
Definitely worth a stop on your way down the coast. Not very crowded either.
a must see monument. Lots of cyclo drivers wanting to take you. We did it on our own. Informative recording inside.
"What a wonderful place to visit. Most of the buildings had to be rebuilt after the American war, but they are still painstakingly rebuilding to the city's original glory. Take good walking shoes and go off road. You can walk all day and still not see it all."
Nice plae to escape the hawkers lots to see and they are in the process of restoring
Wonderful viewing of what could be built by hand and then destroyed very quickly by modern military means.
"We chose not to visit with our guide and were happy exploring the buidings, gardens and ruins on our own. It covers a wide area but you can see the main highlights in an hour or so and then waner to the East Gate for a cold beer in one of the garden bars alongside the moat."
"The sheer scale of the site is fantastic and those buildings which have been rebuilt and restored are a hint of what was before. Sadly much of the area is overgrown with relics of the past under the grass. Apart from the Korean video with a computer generated reconstruction of the site, information is sparse, there were no guides and few English signs. Refer to a good guide book before you go. Regrettably, it appears that the Vietnamese government haven't realised the potential in a full scale restoration project, most of the work has been funded by international agencies."
"The place is big, so didn't feel too crowded. Quite a lot of it's in a fairly poor state, with water damage, rotten wood and faded paintwork. Plenty of bullet holes in walls too. However, renovations show how truely impressive it once was. Was a nice place to wander around and soak in the atmosphere. A great playground for photographers."
Be careful when walking around the citadel as the ground is very slippery due to an abundance of moss on the stones and pavers. The relics are interesting and most of the information presented is explained well.
"This place has so many different areas within, one can easily step off the beaten track and find a tranquil corner. It is also set in the centre of town, which makes it a must-see for those who are here just a short time."
"Amazing place with a lot of history and well preserved. The temples were beautiful and well maintained.

Ensure you have a good guide who can explain all the important information about the history of the Imperial City. You would need a good 2-3 hours to explore this place in full."
"It was bombed badly by the Americans in the war, so what was clearly a very large and important site only had a couple of buildings left standing"
close to town and not crowded as site is huge. Interesting history
"Worth the visit, the main site in Hué. I recommend to visit this site before the tombs. Unfortunately many of the buildings have been destroyed during the war. The locals currently try to restore some of them, but it will take time."
"The Citadel itself is a great attraction. However, there are flaws that can ruin your experience. First of all, this place belonged to the Nguyen Emperor, not Ho Chi Minh! But the first thing you see would be a portrait of HCM being hung at the entrance. I heard a kid in the tour asked whether it was the picture of the Emperor! Second, they really really need to ban the scooters from running IN the Citadel. It should be for pedestrians only!!! You will even find some people driving scooters right outside some of the ancient buildings inside the Citadel!

The Citadel itself is well worth a visit. It just needs a lot of attention for maintenance. However, you should not expect much from the communists.... They don't like taking care of things that don't make them rich overnight and require too much work! The architecture is very nice and pleasant, so I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to see the ancient history of Vietnam!"
"To be completely honest i did not know what to expect from hue' s citadel , after so many wars etc.... But when i got there i really got impressed !!!! It is really a marvelous surprise .....wow.....it is a huge complex with the throne Room , the temple for the former kings ..... Very well done , beautifully painted with chinese colors ..... The main gate is really something ! Dont miss it , one of the biggest surprises of our trip !"
"Despite the wet weather, the children (7 to 15 yrs old) loved it. From the Giant turtle sculpture to giant bronze urn.
After watching an introductory video of the Citadel and exploring, we stop by the little souvenir shop for ice cream and drinks and admire the art work next door.

It's great to see the on going restoration of The Citadel, It will be magnificent once it's done."
"These are the places the government should concentrate on as it is an integral part of not only Vietnams ancient history, but also it's more recent history"
"This is the seat of imperial Vietnam. It provides rich experience of history both ancient and modern. The site shows the relationship of emperor, military, and mandarin. It has strong influences to Vietnamese spiritual heritage both in shrines and the numerology and fung shei incorporated throughout."
"Not even close to the Imperial City Beijing, but it has a whole charm of it's own and should not be missed. The rundown parts give a stark. contrast to the preserved areas, and to my mind helped give it an air of historic charm. Spent a very happy three hours strolling around the grounds, even the 'Royal' concrete tennis court made me smile!"
"Nice to wander around in this impressive city within a city.

A lot of restoration going on. Sometimes it is hard to judge what is authentic. You can wander of the path without anyone being bothered"
"a must see. wonderful history, wonderful architecture"
"Don't miss a visit to The Citadel in Hue, but beware the paving tiles in the rain - very slippery!"
"excellent place to visit, it is possible to go there so easilly from the ideal hotel, it`s walking distance maybe around 15mn...................................so OK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Was very interesting, informative, our guide was wonderful and spoke really good English. Afterwards had a lovely lunch at a local restaurant."
"After a 3 hours drive from Hoi An to Hue, I came with high expectations about the Imperial City. However, I was bitterly disappointed! The place is in in utterly state of disrepair and non-maintenance. Many of the few remaining buildings are overgrown with grass, there are no proper walkways to reach the forbidden city and after 3 days of rain the whole site was so muddy that we ended covered up in dirt. Nothing is remaining of the actual palace except for some foundations. I do understand that the American bombing in 1968 in response to a communist takeover of Hue flattened most of the Imperial City, however, with the number of tourists visiting the site and the money made from entrance fees, there is no reason for such a poor state of maintenance. It is not worth a visit, stay a way and save your time for something else in Hue. Very disappointing!"
"The grounds are beautiful as is the architecture.

If you catch a ride in a cyclo, which is a very nice way to see the city, firmly negotiate the price beforehand. Be careful you don't get overcharged for the driver(s) waiting for your return trip and then giving you an extra tour through the city. We were charged 700,000 each for two hours."
"Eventhough most of the buidlings were bombed into ruins during wars, the scale and remaining restored, and under restoration portion of the citadel are still very impressive. It gives a very good historical lesson and feel on Vietnam very last feudal dynasty (Nguyen). A must visit site for your trip to Vietnam. It would be good if you can read a bit on Vietnam History especially on Nguyen dynasty before the visit. Visit to the citadel will only complete if you combined your visit with Nguyen emperors tombs within Hue"
"We visited the Citadel in pouring rain and didn't find it as impressive as a lot of the sights we saw throughout Vietnam. The forbidden purple city was a bit of a let down with barely anything left standing to explore. The Citadel is in quite expansive grounds, but there isn't anything that really jumps out as particularly beautiful."
It is worth spending the small amount on the ticket to explore the Imperial City. There is still a lot of renovation to be done but it is a relaxing place away from the bussle of the city.
This sight is in the process of being restored. It has suffered from bombing during the Vietnam war. However there is still some areas to visit. Impressive display of life during the time when Hue was the Imperial capital of Vietnam.
My husband and I really loved it. It made me feel like we were back in ancient times.
"A memorable site to visit when going to Hue. The Imperial City used to be the home of Emperors trough centuries, this is the place where they lived with their family and servants. The site's areal is about 700 square meters, facing the Perfume River of Hue. A big part of the Citadel has been destroyed, but there is still enough to see ! (I recommend you to spend about 1½ hour in the Imperial City if not more, because it is truly and unforgettable experience)"
"Well worth a visit to see what is there and imaging what it was like in all its glory, such an incredible shame that war and neglect have damaged or destroyed much of it."
"Fortunately, we had a guide to explain what we were seeing as there really are no interpretive signs. Very interesting."
"LOGISTICS
Hue's citadel or imperial city is located on the northern bank of the Song Huong river. It is walled off and within the imperial enclosure houses the Forbidden purple city. It is within walking distance of the tourist areas of Hue. Costs 55,000 dong entry. Open 7am to 5pm from October to March.

PRO'S
- I felt the best part of this city was actually the entry to the main gates. There is a huge flat tower opposite the road which is great for pictures and the gate itself is very photogenic.
- Call me strange but one of the best things inside the gates is a pond containing a massive amount of goldfish which you can pay 2000 dong to feed. It is very enjoyable, for children and adults!
- A UNESCO heritage listed site this is steeped in history and efforts are being made to restore it to it's former glory.
- Within walking distance of most of the tourist hotels in Hue
- One of the most famous landmarks of Hue

CON'S
- A series of historic conflicts, the most recent of which was the Vietnam war has not been kind to this place and a lot of it's buildings still lay in ruins. The 'forbidden purple city' is particularly damaged. Restoration efforts are being undertaken and construction scaffolding cover some of the buildings.
- The stone paths can become very slippery, particularly when it rains. If you are not steady on your feet or 'athletically challenged' be careful on the stone, which seems to be covered with a fine layer of algae no one seems to want to clean off. Definitely wear shoes (not thongs).
- It often rains in Hue so if you are coming here make sure you pack an umbrella. We got soaked when we were here.
- Difficult to navigate through and you will find yourself often getting lost. Could use some better signage.
- Very dirty with trash laying around.
- Definitely needs some garden maintenance, particularly a good mow. The grass is nearly half a metre tall in some parts!
- Not too much available in the way of information. May be a good idea to get a guide, both to navigate the difficult and large complex and also to explain the historical significance of what you are looking at as to improve your appreciation of it.

CONCLUSION
Because of it's proximity to the tourist are and it's fame it is definitely worth a look if you are in Hue. It would benefit from better maintenance, particularly of the yard and will continue to improve as restorative efforts continue."
"While it's hard to pick at times, much of the old city of Hue lies inside the citadel walls. These stone walls, surrounded by a wide moat, stretch for 2km on each side, giving a total area of 4 square kilometers inside the walls.

Most tours and tourists concentrate on the old imperial city, which, although enormous, only occupies a small part of the entire complex. Restoration work continuse to be carried out here on the buildings that are standing, and the results of this restoration are stunning. However there are large areas where nothing survived the ravages of fire, termites, and bombing in the Vietnam war. The old Purple Forbidden City is now nothing but a wide expance of grass with little remaining to show its former glory.

Although in the scheme of things the Citadel is relatively young by Vietnamese standards, it was the seat of power in Vietnam from the early 1800's until the mid 1900's. There's plenty left to see here, and it's a great showcase of an opulent era of Vietnam's history."
"Huge imperial complex. If you're a slow walker and like to enjoy everything in detail it will take you about 3 hours to visit. Shame many of the buildings were destroyed during the war in1947 - but many great buildings still standing and in excellent condition (outside and inside). The entrace fee is 55,000 dong (just a bit over $2.5)"
"Felt the Forbidden City was a bit overgrown and run down. There was a bit of restoration going on, but a lot of work needed. Been to the Forbidden City in Beijing so hard not to compare, but certainly very different! A little disappointing."
"it' s a great site, with many details, so if you're on an organized tour, you won't have time..."
The Hue Imperial City is a must see when in Hue. Many of the old structure are currently been restored so its a good time to get in and have a look at the ruins before they are re built.
Having visited Beijing a couple years ago being inside the Hue Citidel really brought back memorys of the Forbidden City. Certainly not as big and a bit run down but some stunning scenes and well worth a couple of hours wandering around
"Extremely interesting site, continuing restoration taking place"
"Still a work in progress UNESCO is doing wonders to this place, A must see"
"Very impressive place covering a huge area. Areas destroyed during wars with French and Americans. Areas which were intact had been allowed to become overgrown.

Could benefit with some TLS."
"The main gate is probably the most interesting thing to see. But don't let it seduce you to pay the overpriced entrance fee!

Inside are a few nice buildings but overall just a big mess.
I hope they spend the money from the fees to clean the place up."
"It is sad that most of the building are distroyed during the war. Vietnam are doing a good job in preserving what that is left of it. A guide is a must to explore the site and learned its' rich history.
Must visit site when in Hue."
If it's possible go by yourself for having plenty of time to walk around with a tour it's not possible to do this because they make all the big Hue sites in one day and is too much
"We went to the citadel on a cold and rainy December morning. It costs 55000VND each for entry, which I though was quite reasonable. As others have said, there is some has been beautifully restored, whilst some of it is still in the same state as it was after the war, complete with demolished buildings and bullet holes.

We spent most of the morning wandering around looking at the various displays and just walking the grounds, its quite relaxing. I think we would have gotten more from the experience if we had used a good guide, as they would have been able to explain in detail the different sites.

All in all it was a good morning and I recommend that if your in Hue, check it out."
"Astonishingly large, with some parts in good repair and others long disappeared. Probably in the best repair of any of the ancient sites."
"We spent the best part of a day here in the POURING rain, and ffor much of the time we seemed to have the place to ourselves - only the odd plastic cape visible through the murk in the distance. It covers a very large area and contains everything from immaculately restored pavilions to piles of rubble. Fascinating history - I wish LP had had more detail, and for the first time ever we regretted not being able to find a guide !! There are some info boards, but not many, and it is easy to get (sort of) lost - plus the ground was very slippery. But well worth a visit and a wander, and don't miss the music/dance in the glitteringly restored Royal Theatre - the performers were giving their all to the small and dripping audience and we really enjoyed it - very different material from the shows we saw in Hoi An and My Son."
This destination will improve over time as restoration efforts continue
"we visited under the rain...am sure it's even better with the sun , to lighten up the already decaying palaces."
"Spent a very relaxing couple of hours wandering among the temples and ruins. A guide book is helpful, as the signs for each area are relatively brief and the history of the area is very interesting"
We had an extremely knowledgeable guide (Mr Lang - langricky@gmail.com) who explained all about the citadel's history and really enhanced our experience of this attraction. I would definitely recommend a guided tour if you can.
"This is a worthwhile site to visit. From a range of beautiful buildings to the musicians playing in the main hall and dressing up as an Emperor and an Empress, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit here. They are gradually renovating many parts damaged during the war, but there is a long way to go."
"This is the highlight of Hue city itself, itself the highlight of my Vietnam visit. This place, along with a DMZ tour, made my trip to Vietnam highly worthwhile. The interior is being rebuilt (aka rennovated). The site itself was the location of a great battle in the late 1960s, and many of the battle scars still remain, so I took many photos, since I imagine a decade from now, the entire place will have been entirely rennovated. There are a few old tanks and artillery pieces on display as a reminder of the fighting that took place there.

You can get their by the cheaper motorcycle taxi (cheapest option), or by a normal taxi or operated tour. I highly recommend a bright and early visit, at 8 AM, when it opens. You can walk in the cool morning with few visitors. It starts getting crowded a couple hours later, at which time you're probably wrapping up."
"After busy Ha Noi, Hue was so calm especially once you get inside the Imperial City...if it's sunny take a picnic. Good way to spend the day."
"The Imperial City was modeled on the Forbidden City in Beijing. Unfortunately, the many wars from 1945 through 1975 destroyed many of the buildings. Nonetheless, it is impressive and is very interesting."
not to be missed but make sure you have a brilliant tour guide like Mr Tom - Le Xuan Thong. I have travelled fairly extensively and have never had a guide go so far above and beyond. VExperience was a brilliant tour company that ensured our trip to the old quarter
"worth the visit, well organised.short taxi ride from the hotel,"
Large area with colorful gates and temples and good to see some of the restored palaces!
"Gorgeous architecture, even in the pouring rain. Interesting videos in the main building straight ahead when you walk in. Lovely views from the gatehouse (where you enter), and buildings in the left corner as you enter are well preserved."
Very interesting - we did as part of all day tour with 1 1/2 hours here. Could spend much more time of course. Most of it 18th-19th century so not too old but telling as to why kings weren't too loved maybe!
I wasimpressed at the size of the walled citadel area. It is a shame to see so much destroyed by war. However you can get a true sense of the size of the imperial seat of power.
"Unfortunately a lot of the building within the emperor's city, but impressive site nevertheless and if you have a good guide, then a trip worth doing"
"The Citadel within the Citadel is a must in Hue. Despite all devastions by war it still looks beautiful. Some areas are a little crowded by tourists, but the sights around the center are pretty quiet."
The site has been affected by wars and still needs serious renovation. One of the main halls was leaking when we visited after a rainstorm. However it is still a must do if visiting Hue and we spent 3 hours wandering and enjoying.
very interesting to wander around - more so in the slightly off the way areas than the forbidden city.
Even in the rain you must see this site. Very interesting and very ornate.
"A Sad Disappointment
I was looking forward to visiting the Citadel/Imperial City. It was the reason we came to Hue. Unfortunately, I can’t say it was worth the extra travel. When compared to other historical/archeological sites, it’s lacking significantly. Sadly, so much was destroyed in the wars that plagued this country, that there is not much to see. It’s understandable that full restoration can’t be done, but how about picking up the trash. There was too much of that considering the significance of the site. Also, they could attend to the landscaping and signage. If you’re in Hue, yes see it. If anything it’s a vivid reminder of what war and neglect for history can do. If you’re making a trip to Hue to see it, save your time and money. By the way, it’s not free as the noted in TA – it costs 55,000 VD."
"The citadel suffered greatly in the war but efforts have clearly been made to restore it somewhat. Walking through the shell of the place takes you back to imperial times, and you wont lack for photo opportunities. The takeaway is as much ""what must it have been like before the bombings"" as ""I've gone back in time"" and therefore its a bit sad. That being said, if you find yourself in Hue, you have to see it."
"Fantastic visit well worth it. You need to allow at least 1h30 to 2h to complete the visit and why not try a cyclo tour around the imperial city too (around 150,000 dong for an hour). It was the best thing we did as we stopped and visited garden houses and temples we wouldn't have seen otherwise."
"This site is nice but if you've been to Ankor Wat you may be a bit dissapointed. Do not do this site as part of the ""City Bus Tour"" as you need more time to see everything than is allowed on the bus tour."
The Vietnamese are clearly doing renovation here but much is still required. However it is striking the balance between restoration and making it 'disney'. It is being tastefully done and retaining its authenicity.
A beautiful place and I spent hours here on my own. Save yourself the trouble. Don't go with a tour group. It's right in the heart of the city so you can easily walk here. Spend hours wandering the complex. A little sad to see the grass just growing rampant. Doesn't look like it's being upkept much. But still beautiful
"Unlike other Heritage sites I’ve visited (eg Hoi An, Angor etc..), Hue is in a very poor condition (and not because of its age). Simple things like cutting the grass or putting in proper pathways have all been missed. A real shame amplified by the brand new tennis court which is obviously way more important that the crumbling buildings around it!"
"The Citadel was pretty interesting, but if you're on a tight timeframe, then Hue could be skipped."
"We were very impressed and surprised how vast the citadel itself is, only shame is that they are still have a mountan to climb to restore all the damage doen in the Tet Offensive"
"This is a must see I'd you're in Hue. Entrance fee is 55,000 VND which is under $3. If can convince them you're Vietnamese the fare is 30,000 VND.

Beautiful structure with so many great picture worthy views."
There is a lot missing of course however visitors are able to watch videos of computor graphic reconstructions which definitely gave you a better understanding of the site.
just look at the pics online the place is stunning
"Hue is the special city that has the whole monument of the Royal, most of them are not destroy. All are very well hidden underground. Hue reflects the personality of the people of Central Vietnam very nicely- spend some time here and you'll know what I mean. We took part in Festival called Festival Hue, this is the biggest tourism Festival in Vietnam with the most artists participate in. So exciting."
"When visiting the Citadel, go with a good local guide so that you get all the information about the history of the site."
"WE meandered around the citadel for about two hours. Huge complex, with lots of work being done. Loved the new tennis courts they obviously have their priority's"
"This is a fascinating place which remains largely intact. It gives an insight into the grandeur of the old kingdom, prior to the arrival of the French, Americans and others."
Even although it was pouring with rain we enjoyed our visit. Much of the front part of the Citadel complex has been restored. Ongoing restoration is a positive sign. Complex was very clean.
"The Citadel should have been a highlight given it's history but for a UNESCO sight it needs a lot of work. It was very run down, overgrown with weeds, and lots of trash everywhere. I hope UNESCO is planning to take some action to clean this place up and bring it back to a level it deserves."
"With DMZ Tours we had a great day and this was one of the stops. It would not have been the same without our guide. We learnt about the Emporers, what the colours relate to and the meanings of the animals. Great visit!"
"Of course it was a very hot day, and we had walked from our hotel which must have been the longest way, we needed a seat but there were not many at all here.take a big bottle of water with you."
"Inside the Imperial City was the imperial enclosure called the Purple Forbidden City in Vietnamese, a term similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing. The enclosure was reserved for the Nguyen imperial family. Who knew, right?"
So steeped in history this place was amazing but i would not do it without a guide as we learned so much from him.
Citadel is where the imperial family living druring time time they ruled Vietnam. it was big complex of many constructions. The rampart around the city is about 10 km and take about 4 billion brick to do during 30 years.
"Skip the fee area and walk all/parts of the perimeter and the free admission area. If you're traveling around Vietnam, a lot of what you'll see inside the fee area is the exact same kind of architecture/grounds that you'll see around the country."
"The Citadel in amazing and, when you consider the entirety of the walled city its absolutely huge. It's not Beijing's Forbidden City but it's a good runner up.

The site was extensively damaged during a few wars so a lot has been ruined but you still get a good feel of how grand it once was. If you're a photographer then you'll love it as there's heaps of space to get good unobscured images.

Go and see this now before tourism really sets in and it loses its charm."
"the entrance ticket is a bit high, the chance to wear in vietnamese king and queen dress is really good"
Great to stroll through for 1 to several hours. From there easy access to restaurant and shopping area
At the Citadel you are able to feel and experience the History of Hue And Vietnam it really takes you back in time
"Good to visit once, but not a place i would go back to. Perhaps in 5 years time when more restorative work has been completed it would be good to go back."
Spent a whole morning walking around the vast grounds of the imperial citadel. Some areas have been restored to their full glory while others are just in ruin and overgrown. This is obviously a long slow process as you pass a number of buildings that are currently under restoration. It was disappointeing that we could not get a map of the site and more of an idea of what we were viewing. May be an idea to go on a guided tour so you get this insight. Were still a lot of beautiful areas to see and explore. We negotiated a price with the cyclo riders outside the citidel for a ride around the town and back to the hotel.
"Ok, it was raining when we visited and we did find it interesting, but it could do with more restoration, so that one could better imagine its former splendour. Expect to be pestered on the way to the Citadel by the local trishaw type bike operators who will not leave you alone and will not take no for an answer, when you tell them that you prefer to walk. One tried unsuccessfully to lead us off into the opposite direction to the Citadel but luckily we had a map with us. We finally had to be firm and say 'Enough! Finish' which sent him on his way."
This area is impressive. Especially as the renovations are so extensive. I hope support to continue does not fade. Enjoyed meandering throughout these historical buildings
"Visited when in Hue. I didnt really know much about the place but my husband wanted to go round there. 110000vnd each to get in which isnt too bad. Had a good long look around the area which had some snippets of information, but there could have been more. Some parts on the ground are covered in moss but thankfully there are signs warning you.
We got mega harrassed by cyclo drivers at the entrance which was a little intimadating.
There places to get drinks outside the gates but not that many once inside so take one with you if its a hot day.
There was a very sorry looking elephant on the grounds which was quite sad but i believe they offer rides there."
This place is a must see! There is so much history here. We came here with a local guide. I would recommend getting a guide. This is a huge complex that you can wander around for a while. You will need room on your memory cards for pictures here!! Look for bullet holes on the walls.. The Vietnam war has touched this city in many places.
"The Citadel in Hue may not be as impressive as the Forbidden City in Beijing, but it has a certain charm and gives an essential insight into Hue's imperial past. It is however being restored, and has the potential to be a major draw. For the moment though, you will need a good guide book and a great imagination. There are supposed to be guides available but we didn't find them. Expect to spend about an hour or so here."
Not a huge amount to see but nice to walk round for an hour or two.
"I could spend a whole day here, especially if the weather was warm which it wasn't when I visited.
Allow at least a couple of hours to just wander around this massive complex. I went thre a couple of times and will go again."
"Very impressive! I spent a whole day wandering around, it was not crowded at all and I took lots of great pics."
Visited as part of an excellent all day tour for only US$12. Quite a bit of walking involved but well worth it.
"Superb old imperial city, very worth the visit. You can spend almost a whole day walking around. If you move away from the main areas you'll be almost on your own and feels a very pleasant experience to relax"
We were astonished how beautiful the Imperial city is. Our guide told us a lot of very interesting stories about the Citadel and about the history of Vietnam. He also took us to some places of the Citadel which were out of the way so we were more or less the only tourists there. You should take your time for the visit and go a little bit further than the other tourists - it is worth it!
"We wandered around here for hours. The best thing is to get yourself lost a bit and just wander through the ruins. Great feeling. They have only restored some of the buildings, which makes it all the more beautiful. Very worth the entry fee of 55000 dong! Bring your own food and drinks, as prices inside are quite high. There is an interesting video of the citadel in the second building after the gate (palace)."
"Hue used to be the capital of Vietnam when the last Emperors (Nguyen Dynasty) still control the kingdom. Visiting Hue, you can see the Forbidden City, where the King used to stay and manage the country. You can also visit many Tombs of the Kings.
You can hide a cyclo to drive you around the forbidden city with negotiated price of about 5$ . Or you can hide a bike (with driver) to visit far away places like the Tombs or Lang Co Bay (price depend but you can go all day for about 10-15$)"
"When visiting the site ensure you allow plenty of time & wander all the grounds because there are hidden treasures all over the place to see. We were there for about 5 hours & probably still didn't see it all. Unsure that you visit the theatre which has been restored & has shows on at various times, although when we were there they had been cancelled. At the Northern gate there is a cafe' which has the most amazing coffee & method you must experience. A photographers paradise.
To get there get a boat across the river from the city area - costs about $2 & saves a walk as you will have plenty of that to do at the citadel."
"This C19th complex was built over generations by the last dynasty which came to power in the early C19th. This means that there isn't really anything here that's at all ancient, and given the climate and periods of neglect, parts of the citadel are picturesquely decayed thanks to being targeted and looted in a series of conflicts, of which the Viet Nam war was the most recent. However, some parts are being or have been restored. The basic plan resembles that of the imperial palace in Beijing, with a series of impressive entrances, buildings and courtyards, through which the visitor proceeds and in which, in its time, emissaries and senior administrators were received while the imperial court occupied various palaces which are part of the sprawling complex. It is less magnificent than its Beijing counterpart, but it's also less crowded, and the solo visitor can spend a long time wandering around imbibing the atmosphere and character of the place. I went with a 'conducted' tour (there wasn't much 'conducting'), which restricted the time there, whereas a friend visited it with the help of a friendly trishaw operator, and spent a lot longer and had more time to enjoy it. So I would recommend an independent visit and scheduling more time than the typical conducted tour permits. That way you can explore the nooks and crannies and make interesting discoveries without having to meet a tight tour schedule."
This is an amazing place and absolutely huge once you start wandering around. We spent several hours here and still hadn't seen it all. The buildings are spectacular but it is the gardens and 'wild' areas that are most beautiful. Make sure you take water.
"The place is very interresting to stroll around and for a small river cruise, perfect to relax between 2 train rides"
"To visit the Imperial City is a must on each stay in Hue, especially it there is no fog, it's recommendable to visit without Guide, because in minimum 2 hours are necessary to visit the full area, some buildings are restored (very well), some under concstruction, but one wonderful ist the old library. To walk around and between the walls to discover temples, buildings and others is very nice. Some places are, where you can stay and enjoy the imperial feeling."
"I highly recommend a visit to the Citadel, but go early, we travelled to Hue in August and it was incredibly hot! A friend and I spent about 3 hours wandering around this amazing place – it opens early, so take your hat and sunscreen and enjoy!

A highly recommend getting a guide (note they are not available at the Citadel so arrange one in advance via a tour operator), we didn’t and I think we probably really missed out on some of the history of the place.

The next day we hired a guide and visited the Imperial Tombs and were regaled with all the stories and history of the Nguyen dynasty, it was fascinating stuff and worth paying for. It really enriched our experience and it became more than just looking at some really lovely old building/temples."
A short video demonstration as you enter is quite informative however I found the citadel and all its contents a little overrated. There is still some reconstruction work going on which was a bit messy and alot of it just looked like an overgrown football field.
We had a limited time in Hue and found the half day trip excellent. Those who had gone on the full day trip felt they had padded it out a bit. We were picked up at the hotel and transferred on to a little boat that took us over to the citadel. We had a wonderful tour guide who mesmerised us with stories and the tour went for an hour longer than was advertised in the brochure. After visiting the citadel we went down the River to the Pagoda which was also interesting.
i'm not usually into temples and history sites however this was truly amazing. We hired bicylces from our hotel which was lots of fun. We spent about 2 hours inside and left when it started getting really busy and we started getting very sunburnt! We preferred to check it out on our own rather than with a guide and when we returned to our hotel and looked at our guide book we discovered we had missed out on half of it without realising which was a shame but not surprising as the place is massive. We were surprised to see elephants inside aswell being taken for rides. Definately a must see but bring your sunscreen and allow plenty of time
"Built along the same lines as Beijings Forbidden City, the outer courtyard within the impressive massive brick walls, 10 meters thick in places, is mainly open space & gardens.

A lot of buildings were destroyed during the Tet offensive in the Vietnam War (American War) but restoration is ongoing. It is a large complex with plenty to see.

It is hot so bring water, wear a hat or bring an umbrella for shade & apply sun cream"
"Purely historic and nostalgic, We witnessed what must have been an epic of Vietnamese Royality. The old palace is being renovated to restore some of the crumbling walls and buildings. Plenty of photos showing the past and some special wall paintings showing some stories of the kingdom. It was a nice visit, highly informative. Worth the visit every minute of it."
"Great to wander around without the beeping, hustle and bustle of the everyday Vietnam. Serene surroundings."
"The old Imperial City (Citadel) looks like a smaller version of Beijing's Forbidden City, not as grand nor as well preserved as Forbidden City. The design is very Chinese. Quite a bit of it were bombed so no longer there but you can still imagine what it would have been...

We got there in late afternoon and it was drizzling a little so it was not that hot, which was a good thing. I can't imagine touring this place in full sun. We had a tour guide so she made the citadel interesting with the history. My son enjoyed the space to run around in and being in late afternoon, it was not that crowded.

Entry fee was 55,000 Vietnamese dong per person."
"Likes: You feel a sense of calm and tranquility as you tour the gardens and admire the grandeur of the old city.

Pooh Poohs: If you don’t have a guide, it’s harder to navigate around the premises and at the same time, understanding the history accompanying the city.

Others: It’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Very similar to the forbidden city, but of course more toned down."
Well worth a visit if in the area. Not really much to see but you can imagine what it used to be like. Quite a large complex and is being restored in some areas. Some of the buildings are no longer existent but again worth having a look.
"A very impressive cidatel to visit - even though the only downside was the blazing sun and the mercury was hitting 38/39C. It was full of information and facilities. Fish feeding was fun as the fish pile on top of each other just to get a tiny bit of food! We saw elephant rides, but didn't participate due to the treatment of these animals. The Forbidden Purple City was great to lean about the invasion and occupation of Hue during the American War."
"The Citadel and Forbiden City is a massive complex. Part of it is under reconstruction from the effects of the Tet Offensive in 1968, but what remains to be seen is hard to grasp in a simple afternoon.

It is quite beautiful and there is much to see. It does, however, involve quite a bit of walking. there is not a lot of steps to climb.

You simply cannot visit Hue and skip this site. It is much too important."
"Impossible to understand what this is until you've seen it with your own eyes. An impressive former capital where the Vietnamese Kings ruled from, They had it all worked out with a separate house for the wife and a house for the mother in law way down in the far corner of the city. Unfortunately some buildings are damaged from the French and American wars but all in all very well kept. A must see if your in Hue."
"On second day of Hue trip, we visit the local university. Lunch break up quite late, we departed at 2:30 multitude of interior, the car took us through the door compartment (under NetCoDo) has several cannons on either side of local roads, such as 9 brass deck gun big, heavy, elaborately carved, meticulous, every deck is longer than 5 feet, 9 lists on the pedestal of wood, the car took us to the nearest ticket and go find parking, not parking in them. Admission per person is 35 thousand. We are very pleased with what we learn. If I have a chance to visit Hue I will explore more thoroughly."
"A very historic place but there's nothing special to me. I had once visit Forbidden City in Beijing, this place is a similar one. However, if you want to learn more about Vietnamese history, this place is worth."
"We took the train from Danang to Hue, Beautiful trip along the side of the cliffs, white sand coastline and blue seas one side and mist covered mountains on the other. Well worth it and cheap.

It is a bit rustic on the trip, cockroaches on the walls and your heighbour behind you is likely to put their feet up on your seat arm. Only a three hour journey though and it is air conditioed to a very comfortable level. all worth the journey and Hue itself is well worth vistiing.

the Citadal is certainly worth a visit and the tombs are a tranquil delight. We took the river cruise to see the tombs. Boats are along the river, east of Tranf Tien bridge. We organised a boat for the three of us as we wanted the flexibility of schedule. The family we went with were great and we changed our agenda as we progressed. It was 5 and a half hours and we had lunch on board. We visited the Thien Mu Pagoda, then Tomb of Tu Duc and then Tomb of Minh Mang. All good but Minh Mang is a must, delightful, very tranquil. Your boat will visit more however. Be aware that some Tombs require a motorbike taxi from the river eg Tu Duc. Bargain hard.

Also watch for scams at the tomb ticket booths. Twice attempts were made to short change me. Just be polite and point out their ""error"" and the money is handed over with a smile.

Go early and beat the heat if you can, assuming you are lucky like us and got a day in Hue without the rain. Leaving at 8am with lunch on the boat we were back just after one. The boat will drop you on the river bank next to the Citadel on the way back if you request. That way if you are up to some walking inthe heat you can see most of what Hue has to offer in one day."
"imperial city or citadel of hue is one of the best attractions in vietnam i think. it's amazing how big this monument really is. with two walls protecting the inner palace, it cover a large land area. within the outer walls, many residents of hue city reside in the simple humble homes. the front garden of the imperial city is really tranquil and it makes you wonder how well the kings and their people lived there. our tour guide named Thanh explained us almost everything in this wonderful place. it is a must-see if you are visiting central vietnam."
"We took a one day trip from Hue to My Son to Hoi An return, booked through Stop and Go Cafe in Hue. We were assigned Mr Bi as the driver for the day. Mr Bi was polite and courteous, answered our questions about Vietnamese life and culture and was patient when we came back late in the afternoon from Hoi An (leading to a late return). Mr Bi volunteered to take us via the scenic route. Overall, we would highly recommend Mr Bi as a driver. The car which we were assigned was also modern and spacious.

He gave to me his contact details for those that are interested .
Phone number : + 84 905 290039 or (0905 290039) inside Vietnam
Or E-mail direct for Tour guide service to lcthanh2006@yahoo.com
I am very thankful to have such a memorable experience in Hue , and that is purely because of the unforgetable experience i had with Mr Thanh."
"The Imperial City is built on the same principles as the Forbidden Palace in Peking (I read in guide book) Around 2 km square, it took 20,000 man to construct the walls. A lot of thing for camera. Should visit."
"Tour the citadel on your own without a guide (unless you just cannot bring yourself to do some research). The site is being restored but there is much there to see. Here's a REALLY good tip. Wait until you visit Halong Bay to purchase gifts.. There is a market in Halong City (across the street from Heritage Halong Hotel) that offers absolutely every item sold in HCMC, Hue, Hoian, Danang, and so on, at MUCH cheaper prices and you can bargan all day long. If you are traveling from south to north it is best to wait until you get to Halong to buy gifts."
"We did a trip up to Hue from Hoi An and I am so pleased we made the effort. The citadel was charming. Yes it did sustain bad damage from the various conflicts, but some of it remained intact and some has been restored and to be honest I find a site that isn't 100% pristine and perfect far more charming and interesting to visit. It's all part of the history. If you want 100% perfect don't come to Vietnam because you'll be disappointed. The thing about Vietnam is it has tons of character, but that character is made up of a colourful and varied past that does include a long fought war for independence, which did damage some of the historic sites. But that doesn't mean they aren't worth visiting. The day we went to the citadel was a couple of weeks after Typhoon Ketsana and still in the rainiest month of the year so the site was quite flooded and it felt like we were on a bit of an adventure navigating the new lakes that had appeared. It was beautiful on a grey rainy day, so on a sunny day it must look even lovelier."
"The Imperial City is much more than just the Forbidden City area where the Emperors lived. It is a whopping 2 km x 2 km, and surrounded by a moat. Inside the Citadel area, you'll find a lively and interesting local area, with artifacts left over from the French Occupation dotted throughout. You can walk the city streets or better yet ride a bike and spot these artifacts, or better yet, get a tourist map to help you. There are temples, cookhouses, monasteries, and other buildings dotted throughout this 1,300 acre (520 hectare) area, of which the Forbidden City area occupies only a tiny fraction - about 25 acres (10 Hectares). This area is most of Hue, actually, and it's most interesting area, much better than the backpacker district across the river.

Due to it's size, you'll need a day on a bike to really explore it. Most of the area was burned down by the French when they left Hue, and the Americans took care of much of the rest with bombing during the Vietnam War, but the structures that remain, including the city walls, create an interesting area full of local residents going on about their lives.

The chief attraction, of course, is the Forbidden City area, which was home to the Emperors, but it was burned then bombed, so only a few structures remain - a few others are getting restored under UNESCO supervision, but that will take a while."
"We flew to Hue this morning on Vietnam Airlines. The flight felt nicer than all of the German domestic carriers and many international flights we've been on. The flight attendants were friendly and we met some German fellows which were fantastic. Before leaving home, we’d decided to hop on and off a bus at several places along the way to Hue from Hanoi, but after reading several of the recent stories in which local buses were described as just a rolling prison cell and the beds were no bigger than a coffin, we changed our mind and the flight was great.

We stayed at the Saigon Morin Hotel, arranged by Aurora Travel and got a Junior Suite which was a good deal (175$ per night, breakfast and taxes included). The room was spiffy, had a balcony that looked over the downtown area. The A/C worked very well which was wonderful because we were traveling in the roasting heat of the summer months. This hotel resembled us of the Sofitel Metropole where we had a high tea break while in Hanoi. The old French style was captivating, fruit baskets, chocolate and a poem note on the side table were a wonderful touch. The outdoor restaurant and bar were fascinating, the pool was lovely and of a comfortable size and the ambiance in whole was cozy and homely.

We lunched in the hotel restaurant, after a shower and a bit of sleep, and then headed for a half day tour. Son met us at the hotel with 2 cyclos which the girlfriend and I shared one and Son had the other to himself. After we’d settled in, Son took us around in a few minutes for a good orientation and told us what we were going to visit that afternoon, and then off we went.

The traffic… We’re always impressed by the local traffic wherever we go abroad and had the impression that the traffic here was way less busy than that in Hanoi which was amazing. Son were brilliant by explaining the major differences between the way of living of the local residents and those in other parts of the country, their accents, customs and many other things we could hardly find in any guidebooks. I just thought it must have been very difficult for one to grasp a good understanding of the area without a knowledgeable guide.

The city’s located less than 50 miles from the Demilitarized Zone (the former border between North and South). This strategic location cursed the city with heavy fighting during the war. During the New Year of 1968, the city was overtaken for three weeks by North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong forces that proceeded to massacre 'uncooperative elements"" of Hue's population. Two weeks of heavy American bombings which were followed by intensive combat finally forced the North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong forces to retreat. Besides the tens of thousands of civilian casualties, the conflict laid waste to most of the city and its historic structures. Many other areas of American control that experienced heavy fighting during the war are located near Hue, including the Khe Sanh Airbase and the Con Thien Firebase. Happily, Hue today is a vibrant and friendly town.

The citadel housed the royal palaces, complete with official reception rooms, queen's residence, queen's mother's residence, king's mother's residence, concubine housing, opera theatre, royal library, day rooms, ponds, lakes, covered walkways and so on. It must have been absolutely beautiful when in use - all gold and red paint. We saw the magnificent clothing worn by the Emperors, hand embroidered silk robes, with intricate designs. Quite a few of the royal buildings are still magnificent but some were damaged during the American war in 1968. There are many gates which are wonderful, with inlaid ceramics in bright colors, featuring the dragon and phoenix. I kept imagining how splendid this must have been, with the royal household present in their fine robes, surrounded by tranquil ponds, peaceful and secluded gardens, mandarins and court attendants doting on the emperor, all the majesty of court life.

By the south gate is a flagpole called Flag Tower which according to Son is the tallest flagpole of Vietnam. It was first erected in 1809, was almost destroyed in 1947 and re-erected in 1949. The tower rises 37 meter high upon three tiers that represent the natural order of earth, human beings and death.

We wandered about the citadel for the rest of the afternoon, seeing the remains and keenly listening to Son’s awesome commentaries at every spot we stopped by. The touring was finished at around 5:30pm and it was a very special experience lazing on a cyclo, seeing the city life when the streets were lit up and schoolgirls cycling home in their traditional long dresses.

Back to the hotel at about 6pm and said goodbye to Son, we’d a bath, put our most beautiful costumes on and headed out to Ancient Hue restaurant for dinner after Son’s recommendation which didn’t disappoint us at all. The staff were nice and the food was seriously yummy with sensational presentation and flavors. The ice cream is to die for which the girlfriend raved about. The restaurant’s set in impressively lush gardens and traditional buildings.

The next morning, we were picked up early for a full day to the Demilitarized Zone (or DMZ as it’s known). Although the road wasn’t that good and the traffic was something else, the trip out there was pleasant and Son did a great job of describing the peculiarities of driving in Vietnam, elaborating the current living conditions and income of the people living in the places we were going to visit, their customs and festivals, etc. The drive was almost 2 hours but by the time we arrived we’d already got acquainted and looked forward to the trip.

Our first stop was to the Hien Luong Bridge which was first built by French sappers in 1950 and was selected as a temporary line of demarcation between the North and the South under the Geneva Agreement on Vietnam signed in 1954. Before the Bridge was built, the only way to transport goods and people across the river was by boat. However, not too long after the bridge was built, Vietnamese people could not cross the river anymore without a very special permission from both sides. Now it’s a historic landmark and of course a great tourist attraction.

Next up, we were taken to Vinh Moc tunnels which were interesting and far less claustrophobic than the Cu Chi tunnels. There were over 200 miles of tunnel networks some 23 meters down all over Vietnam. Seeing the tunnels as well as listening to Son’s description of the war gives a real sense of how difficult it must have been to live in the hot, damp, suffocating tunnels for so many years. There were even hospitals, weapons manufacture areas and birth chambers underground. We spent several hours there as it was fascinating and the museum had lots of photos of life in the tunnels including a number of babies who were born in the tunnels complete with rattan cribs. The exits were on to Cua Tung Beach, designed so that sea breezes filled the tunnels with fresh air. We then jumped into the car to see the Rockpile. It was a huge hill where the US Army placed a watch and fire mission as it had a commanding view of the surrounding area.

Continuing on the tour, we drove over to a section of the Ho Chi Minh trails which showed just how resourceful the Vietnamese were in constructing a two-lane tarmac highway complete with nearby Road Bridge and Khe Sanh Combat Base which was the site of a controversial siege during one of the bloodiest battles of the war. Standing here now though is a relatively serene picture of green hills and fields which the only way you would know anything took place is by the few pieces of American military equipment put on display and a small museum full of fairly interesting photographs with captions such as ""Americans running away in terror."", but the best read was in the visitor’s book since the comments from both Vietnam Vets and some passionate American tourists were saddening and enlightening.

The trip ended with a visit to the village of the Ninh Kieu ethnic minority group which was a great finale. Along the way, most people said ""hello"" and looked out of their shacks to see what was going on. Kids were everywhere again (like in Sapa), some of them kept asking for ‘money, money’. The girlfriend pulled out some cash but didn’t seem to have enough for all of them. These were the poor of the poor however our guide assured us they get 3 meals a day!

In summary, if you’ve an interest in history and the war, the tour is worthwhile as it does put places heard about or read about in perspective. Frankly it was the right thing we were looking for, since we’re history buffs, and Son’s profound knowledge just hit the spot."
"This place is really spectacular. It is over two centuries old and is about 10 kilometers in its perimeter with a moat surrounding it.. There's a pyramid structure with a flag on top that one can see from a distance and this resembles some type of old fortress. The citadel has several entrances and, once inside, the visitor can see how enormous it is. Inside are temples, large urns, cannon, and other relics of the past 200 years. One can walk around inside this place for several hours. This is an attraction that anyone visiting Hue should not miss."
